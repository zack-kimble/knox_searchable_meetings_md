| 0:00:29| Welcome to the Board of Education's February 9th, 2023 regular session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=29)|
| 0:00:39| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=44)|
| 0:01:13| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| Board members, a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| Mr. McMillan will not be in attendance this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| We do expect him back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| Monday, February 20th is a system-wide in-service day and therefore a student holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| Also, just a reminder that these public meetings are the only opportunity the board has to discuss items that come before us as an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=92)|
| 0:01:40| We're glad you chose to attend tonight, but please note that elevated noise makes it difficult for all of us to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| So not only those here, but those viewing from home as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| So we ask if you need to have a discussion with someone else in the room that you will please step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=113)|
| 0:02:01| Also, board members and staff along those same lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| we have received some feedback that indicates sometimes those in the audience and those watching at home cannot hear our comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=125)|
| 0:02:15| So if everyone can please be mindful to speak a little loudly and into your microphone during discussion, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=135)|
| 0:02:26| As far as changes to the agenda, you received an email yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| but I wanted to remind you that due to time and sensitivity, Superintendent Reiswick and I agreed to the addition of Item 5C9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=150)|
| 0:02:39| which is a form agreement with Winter Guard International to allow some of our high school bands to participate in their upcoming events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| Also, I would like to add, Ms. Owen, sorry, request a legislative update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=167)|
| 0:02:57| I think she has a brief update for us, and if we could just do that prior to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| So any other changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| I apologize, Madam Chair, for not mentioning it earlier, but I'd like to add an update on the custodian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=186)|
| 0:03:14| Will we stand with that from the superintendent, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| So we will add that right after the legislative update. Can we do that? Are we good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=200)|
| 0:03:29| Any other requested changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| Madam Chair, I'd like to pull Item 8C from the consent agenda for additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| It's not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| Okay, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| I thought the same thing too, but it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Okay, so do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| So a motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Horn. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| All right, so Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| First, I'd like to say that all of the things that, all of the advantages we had from having lobbyists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=250)|
| 0:04:19| and having our association with other districts, without those, it is a huge lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| So it's very important that if anyone knows of any bills that you have questions about or concerns about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| please let me know. There are nearly 300 bills right now related to education that we're following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| So my ability to get to all of those is very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| Since last week, I've spent about 47 hours just on legislative items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| So any help you can give there would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| I appreciate Ms. Jackson reaching out and giving me some questions that our counselors have had about a particular bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| So if there are any other questions, if you'll let me know, that will be greatly helpful so I can reach out to the bill sponsors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| or to others on the committee to get that information for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| All that being said, this week has been pretty light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| So the only bill we are following, House Bill 68, has moved from subcommittee, from the K-12 subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=321)|
| 0:05:29| and it will be in the Education Administration Committee next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| And it is a bill to extend the summer learning programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| So instead of those summer learning programs ending, it's to extend them one further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| They believe there's a great need to continue those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| And some of the questions that were asked are about our flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| because they've noticed that there are more students in lower grades who have more consistent attendance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| And so they want to be sure that districts have flexibility to use that summer learning however we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| So it can be focused more on lower grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| It could be focused more on a particular grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| However we need to do it, they are looking for us to have that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| So that's something that I appreciate, and I think as a district we will as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| It looks like that is funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| They are also using some TANF funds, if that is possible for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| and they're looking at all different ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| But the main thing is for us to have flexibility in using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| So that's something that's definitely something we want to support moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Thank you, Ms. Sellin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| Dr. Ryslick, do you have that update for Reverend Miller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| I'm actually going to have Ms. Himmelgarn speak to a little bit of that, and Dr. Adams may have something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| I know we've had a couple of days now where we've had those custodians that have been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| but I know Ms. Himmelgarn has the actual numbers and some of that, so I'll turn it over to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| Madam Chair, members of the board, we do have, as of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| these numbers are as of Monday, February 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| There were 50 Duncan & Sons employees that were cleared to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| and then we had eight additional that we were awaiting background check results for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| So they, I believe the contract provided for 50 positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| but they've sent more to be cleared just to allow for some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=449)|
| 0:07:38| So that's some good news there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| I know that was a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| All right, so any other questions on that or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| Item 5, Consent Agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| So a motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=479)|

| 0:15:11| So, board members, I would like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| to withdraw this contract from tonight's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| and do another waiver for the 2022-23 school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| like we did last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| and then revisit this policy in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| You know, I have talked to Dr. Eiswick about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| and Dr. Adams and Ms. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| There are some reasons this came into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| and I'm sure Gary can speak to them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| You know, but I do think we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| with partially the economy the way it is, too, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| I mean, I think a lot of people are struggling, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| So I would like for us to consider doing another waiver this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| and then having a lengthier discussion about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| at our next policy review meeting on March 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| Can we just get some explanation on exactly what that waiver is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| from whom, and that kind of thing, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| So what we did last year was just suspend the collections aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| Is that correct, Dr. Eiswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| And, Gary, you may have told me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| I think the last two years there was a USDA across the board for the federal side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| but the year prior to that I believe the board did vote to suspend the policy for that year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Yes, that's my understanding, and I think Ms. Foster is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| and she's certainly the expert on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| But, yes, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| I would also add that some type of policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| this policy was put into place for a couple different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| One was audit findings back in 2015 and 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| and the other one was, closely on the heels of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| USDA regulations require a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| It doesn't necessarily say exactly what has to be in that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| but by July 1st, 2017, this board needed to have a policy, so it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Now, if you all want to talk about what's in that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| that's certainly your prerogative, but I would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1040)|
| 0:17:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| So that we can be better prepared to discuss this at policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| I'd like to see if there's a possibility in budgeting for us to look at a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| that would be a Knox County Schools Collections position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| so that the collections could be done instead of from a viewpoint of profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| because the collection agent takes a piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Instead of being done from a lens of profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| that it be done more from a social work lens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| so that we could find out where the issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| and if students are having other difficulties that we may need to know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| or maybe it's just they need to fill out the correct forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| So if we could have a position that did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| I think it would be approximately the same amount that the percentage is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| that the collection agent would take out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| So if the staff could look at what that would cost and what that would take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| and if that would solve the issue, I'd like to look at that at policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate you bringing the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| I want to make sure, too, that I'm clear on the waiver issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| So to me there's two possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| One is we just don't approve this contract tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| and we're not going to have a collection agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| because we don't currently have a collection agent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Correct, we don't currently have a collection agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| And we just leave things in terms of the status quo until we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| So the current contract we have ends in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| I don't believe they start doing the work until June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| if I understood that correctly, talking to Ms. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| I was under the understanding that it expired, so if we can get clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| And the other, I guess waiver might not be the appropriate term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| but this comes before the board because it's part of board policy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| So the spirit of that is that they are honoring board policy to bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1176)|
| 0:19:45| So just us saying we don't want to do this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| So really what I think I hear you asking is for us to suspend that portion of board policy until we discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| Right, the pertinent portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| They said waiver at one time, but regardless of how we want to word that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| the intent is that the reason it's here is because it is board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Ms. Foster, is the contract that we had currently active?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| So we haven't had to use it the past couple of years, but we have used the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| We used it for collections in the 16-17 school year, 17-18, and 18-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| Okay, so we have an active contract that we just haven't been using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| because we suspended board policy related to this in a prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| So board policy was suspended in 19-20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| and then we didn't have any accounts to send to collections in 20-21 or 21-22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| due to the federal waivers, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Okay, so it's just been an inactive contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| So based on what Ms. Christie is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| if we choose to suspend this portion of policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| then we would still have an active contract that we just would not be utilizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| If you all approve the contract, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Well, no, I don't mean if we approve this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| We don't have any renewals left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| So that's why we solicited this contract again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| So we would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| And we send accounts to collections at the end of the fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| so we would be utilizing this contract in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| and the current contract we have would no longer be valid in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Okay, so by the time we would use it, it would be null and void anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| So Ms. Christie, I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| and I think maybe the right language is that we suspend this portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| board policy until we have an opportunity to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| And Ms. Owen, I do appreciate your suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| and would love the idea of really the spirit of it being more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| how do we come alongside of a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| that is doing it for profit purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| And I don't fault them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| That's their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| And we, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| we actually do have someone in my department who is doing that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| If we could have just a history of pre-COVID for that policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| So we can see what has happened maybe the past, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| And the other thing I wonder is since we have had the USDA waiver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| I wonder if there are parents who maybe don't even realize that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| to pay this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| So probably wouldn't hurt to remind everybody because I can, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| even though I'm sure they've been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| there's a lot to take in in the beginning of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| and they may not realize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| So that would probably be good for all the principals to just send a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| reminder to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Ms. Horn, I can tell you that I know, and I'm getting reminded often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| So I think my son is up to $50 that he's now going to have to pay because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| he packs his lunch, but then he also eats lunch as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| So, yeah, we are getting automatic messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| And I do think we have a public forum speaker on this as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| We have a public forum speaker on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Mr. Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Oh, let us get our time clock up for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| We have it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Just state your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Oh, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| All right, I'll start that over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| And you guys have kind of already danced around the issue that I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| And I'm glad to see that there was extra attention paid to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| So I just wanted to say that I don't think it's good to let a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| company take 21.5% cut of whatever they can get from families that owe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| a little lunch money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| And I just wanted to talk about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| So we know that the federal government funds free and reduced lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| services for kids in schools that are poor enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| And I doubt that any of your children short of a $50 debt that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| easily remedied are really lacking for lunch money here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| Somewhere in between are working class people who have fallen behind for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| some reason, you know, a pandemic job loss or an expensive medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| emergency or the death of a provider in the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Families like this might not qualify for federal funds, but they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| still run out of money before the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| And if you hire a collection agency, we're deciding that those families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| should suffer even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Our superintendent has a quarter million dollar salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| All of you guys are homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Most of you have enjoyed significant gains in the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| I think two of you are landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| One of you has like four 800 square foot units that rent out for $1,200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| a month, and I bet those rates have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| One of you received your home basically as a gift from your parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| just a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| But between 30% to 40% of the county rents, and rents are up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| and wages are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| So working class Knox County citizens are really feeling that crunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| and they're rarely the loudest voices in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| So school attendance is mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| There's punishments for students and parents when kids don't show up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| I don't think there should be more punishment for families that can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| afford to pay for food in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| We have volumes of research that show that well-fed students learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| better than hungry students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| And if the purpose of schools is education, then students should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| high quality food for free every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| And if we are not brave enough to move our school system in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| direction, I think that we should at least give some grace to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| that are falling in the gaps, especially right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| So I really support that you guys are delaying action on this until you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| can review this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| So I just say please decide that we don't need to hire bullies to hassle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| parents and families over lunch money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| So the motion on the floor is to withdraw the contract with IC Systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| Incorporated from tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| suspend the procedures for collecting debt section of policy E191,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1570)|
| 0:26:19| and move policy E191 back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| So we had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| Who did the second, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| We had several seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| I think Ms. Owen was one of them, and that was the first one I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| So we had a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| So do we have any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1604)|

| 0:27:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1626)|

| 0:27:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Dr. Reisman, can you just have somebody put this adoption of textbooks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| context in terms of just our process of textbook adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| and also for some people in the public, I'm sure this seems like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| tremendous amount of money for any books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| That's the next item, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| That's the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Well, those questions will stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| They're already working on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| So we had the motion by Reverend Butler, second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1681)|
| 0:28:10| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Item 9B, approved fund balance designation in the amount of $7,500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| for math textbooks and science and ELA materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| So a motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Mr. Watson, would you like to add anything to that before I cut you off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| That was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| There was two transfer items at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| and I just got confused which one we were on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Same questions, Dr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Do you need me to repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| No, no, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Thanks, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| I'll actually ask Dr. Wilson to speak to the adoption process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| and, again, we can speak to the overall cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| and how this is not really the full cost, too, if we need finance to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| So if you'll recall, earlier in the semester, last semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Gary Petko came to talk about the textbook adoption committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| which is a standard process we go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| as we fall into different cycles with the state for textbook adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| In particular for this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| we do have a math textbook adoption coming up this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| again, driven by those state timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| So the bulk of what you see in that cost, the $7.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| is for math textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Again, bringing it early enough in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| to ensure that we've got materials in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| so that we can provide teacher support and training during the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| and be ready to launch those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| That is not the full cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| When you look at that for the math adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| I believe we've got, like, 4.27 already earmarked in ESSER for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| And, actually, this amount that you see for the math textbooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| is kind of the middle-of-the-road package, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| Our teachers do go through a process of selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| and based on those recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| once we know which direction they're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| we'll have a better sense of exactly what the final cost would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| The science and ELA portions of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| as I said, the state is the driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| in terms of the cycles of when we adopt textbooks and curricula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| and they've actually pushed the science adoption back a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| since we last adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| So we actually have a couple of gap years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| in terms of materials, consumables, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| that go with the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| and we're just filling in for those gap years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| till we make the adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| And then with the ELA materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| that is a source back to making some transitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| on our early literacy instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| across all of our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| And there's been times in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| when we've not been able to fully adopt when we needed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| Yes, when you look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| that's where you start to have to kind of wheel and deal a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| and figure out what you have money for in terms of what you adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Mr. McPherson, because this is coming out of fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| could you speak to the impact on fund balance overall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Yes, thank you, Mr. Watson, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| So yes, our proposal is that it would come from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| The one thing that I could report right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| is we are running at about an 8% surplus in sales tax collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| through the first five data points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Those dollars alone would be sufficient to even do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| which would essentially mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| we wouldn't even have to go into the existing fund balance levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Technically, it would be fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| It would just be those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| that would not ordinarily close to fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| That would be earmarked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Right now, we're probably sitting at, you asked about the level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| That's kind of a difficult thing to pin down on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| We can pin down cash, fund balance is a little different animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| But we're probably looking at about $69 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| After this or before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| This would be, well, so we're currently at about $69 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| We're projecting a surplus right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| through five data points of about $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| So after this, it would bring it back down to about the $69 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| So you think it would be about a wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| So typically, when we have that surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| it would just go to fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| So we have a motion by Mr. Watson and a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1931)|

| 0:32:24| for replacement of the playground at Adrian Burnett Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| Motion by Mr. Triplett, a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1956)|

| 0:32:46| for installation of preschool and primary grades playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| at Lonsdale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Motion by Reverend Butler, second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Dr. Reiswoldt, we had a lot of conversation back in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| around playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| So can you speak to what's driving these two agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| and why they're before us tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| So these are trying to stay in the order the board had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| healthy discussion in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| So it's trying to stay true to historic practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| and not trying to set a new precedent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| For the board as you all make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| In both of these situations, we have a practice when we build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| if we have to remove or damage playgrounds, that we do restore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| And in both of these cases, Adrian Burnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| where we actually built on that same property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| we had to remove the existing playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| So this is a replacement for that in real-time dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| I mean, this is obviously more than it would have cost back when it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| And then when you get to Lonsdale, a little trickier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| because that playground is still intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| However, Sam Hill, where the students came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| that we were actually pre-K through first grade, kind of our primary area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| they had a playground there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| So by moving those primary students back to the bigger, new Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| again, technically their playground from Sam Hill was gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| so we replaced that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| So these are both replacement playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| I appreciate the distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| I think it's important, especially because we just approved an agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| just a little bit ago for approving a grant for another school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| who's been raising funds for their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| So thank you for the work, Dr. Adams and the rest of the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| for bringing this proposal to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| And I know in our discussion in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| I talked about bringing back a more robust proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| I've been working on that within the community and the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| and so I look forward to presenting something for the board to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| at the March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| So we have a motion by Reverend Butler and a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Item 9E, approve adjustment to Amherst Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| and Cedar Bluff Elementary School zone lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| Motion by Ms. Henderson, a second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I know in my short time on the board, just two and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| I've not seen a lot of agenda items like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| and typically I've heard us talk about creating all new zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| So, Dr. Adams, can you just speak to what's driving zone lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| for two particular schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you, Mr. Watson and Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| So basically what we have currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| there's a subdivision that has approximately five homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| where students are not currently residing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Beyond that point, there's a new subdivision going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| so we're basically just capturing that new subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| so the lines are clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Mr. Dillingham has done an exceptional job of making sure that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| clean lines so we don't cut across a neighborhood right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| And so even though it's not perfect throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| he has done an exceptional job of ensuring that we capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| full neighborhoods where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| So what's creating this is new development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| So we have a motion by Ms. Henderson, a second by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Item 9F, approve the new Northwest Sector Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| to be named Mill Creek Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| with school colors of blue and silver and an otter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| as the school's official mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| So a motion by Ms. Henderson, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2192)|

| 0:36:41| Item 9G, grant authority for the director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| to approve and sign any settlement agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| related to the Knox County Board of Education's litigation with Jewell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| and the other defendants in said suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| and to accept any related settlement funds on the school system's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| Moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2218)|

| 0:37:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| So that concludes our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Ms. Henderson, we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| First up, Mr. Dupree, David Dupree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| Welcome, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Please state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| My name is David Dupree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| My county of residence is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| And I'm here to speak about a situation that I thought was an atrocity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| for Holston Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Holston Middle School was probably the only school in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| whereby the students that played on the basketball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| for the girls and the boys as well as the cheerleaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| had their own transportation to and from games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| I've never heard of such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| I think Vine had to do it for one or two games as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| But all the other middle schools had buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| All the other middle schools had transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| When I played basketball back in 19-whatever with Vine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| we had a bus all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And it's hard to believe that here X number of years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| that Holston Middle School could not have a bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| which is crazy because they had excellent teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| The girls won the district, and the boys were runner-up in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| They went on to the regionals and had to have their own transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| to the games in Cleveland, Tennessee, where both teams lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| Both teams probably would have won, but you know what they lacked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| They lacked the opportunity to bond and be cohesive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| which is what you get when you ride the bus and be able to come as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| But you go to the games, and you see this one's straggling in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| this one's straggling in, this one's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| One or two are warming up on the basketball court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| and the others are just getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Where do we dress? Where do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| And then here comes the coach because the coach has to get their own way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| They had good teams at Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| They could have done well in the regional tournament, the sectional tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| but neither one made it because they didn't have the cohesion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| that comes with being able to build a team like all the rest of the middle schools had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| because they all had buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| But Holston Middle School did not have a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| And the other part of this is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Parents like me who had a daughter that was a cheerleader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| and other parents who had students that played or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| had to take off work, had to make arrangements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| had to do whatever it took to get their child there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| because the child wanted to be there and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| It messed up all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| Don't let that happen when every other school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| especially those on the other side of town, had buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| and you couldn't get a bus because this is on this side of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| It's a tragedy. It shouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Sandy Bush, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| Just state your name, county residence in three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| Hi. My name is Sandy Bush, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| My name is Sandy, as I said, and I have two sons in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| My oldest is a seventh grader who is in general education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| and my youngest is a fifth grader who is in a self-contained special education classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| and he is here with me in the back, maybe out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| I wanted to speak to you today about ABA therapists coming into the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| to help support our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| ABA, or Applied Behavioral Analysis, is a research-based behavioral therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| It must be prescribed by a doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| and it is paid for by insurance for kids that have an autism diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Knox County does have behavioral support services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| but they're not in every classroom every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| My son has a functional behavioral assessment and plan in place through the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| but the supports he receives, while also important, are different than ABA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Special education teachers are already tracking a lot of data for each child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| to measure IEP progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| They don't have enough staff in these classrooms to track behavioral data like ABA does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| If a child is working through behavioral challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| having a one-to-one therapist who specializes in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| will benefit the Knox County staff by allowing them to focus on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| My son is working with ABA on transitions and elopement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| which are two of the biggest struggles he has at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| Similarly to how private duty nurses come into school to focus on the medical needs of a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| registered behavioral technicians could come in to the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| to focus on the behavioral needs and interventions for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| ABA can work to identify triggers of disruptive and dangerous behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| and teach safe responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| This, in turn, would reduce the frequency that these behaviors escalate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| to requiring emergency interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| There's a bill in our legislature now that, if passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| would expand who is able to use mechanical restraint on children in special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| While it might not be possible in every situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| it makes sense to try to prevent these behaviors from escalating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| by allowing therapists to work with them at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| While there doesn't seem to be a written policy against outside therapists coming into the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| parents across the district are told that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| I have been told that no outside therapists are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| and I think the staff at our school believes that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| If something really is an IEP team decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| there needs to be communication from the top down that this is an accepted practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| Not all students receiving special education have autism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| and not all children with autism want or need to utilize ABA therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| For those that do, however, this could really make a positive impact on their educational experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| and help us all to work together to achieve the district priority of success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| I want my child to succeed, and I'm happy to work with everyone to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Thank you, Sandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Next up, we have Courtney Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Just set your name and county of residence in three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| Good evening. Courtney Piper, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| I'm sharing my story today in the hopes that no other parent has to go through what I've been through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| This board is able to make or clarify policy and can encourage the administration to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| That kind of leadership is needed to allow ABA therapy in Knox County classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| and make success for every student accessible to students with autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| My son, Aiden, was diagnosed with autism in March 2022 by a medical doctor at East Tennessee Children's Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| and prescribed ABA therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| ABA therapy is the only therapy approved to treat autism spectrum disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Our insurance approved 30 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| He began kindergarten at Sunnyview Primary in August of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| Knox County schools implemented an IEP for Aiden in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| but that IEP is not meeting Aiden's special education needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| so I asked about his registered behavior technician joining him in the classroom at our expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| Details were sent to the board via email on January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| Over the course of five months, I've received inconsistent, conflicting, and at times false information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| and have experienced delays in attempting to correspond with KCS administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| about getting ABA in the classroom for my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Other school districts in East Tennessee allow outside providers to implement ABA in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| This is not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| In September, I asked about allowing ABA therapy in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| and was told by the director of special education that KCS had a policy against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| The director of special education also compared the therapy to karate and piano lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| I asked for the policy several times over the course of two and a half months and did not receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| I was told the same things again by KCS employees in November at an IEP meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| and then in December at another IEP meeting, I was told there was no such policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| It was more of a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Both meetings were called at my request to ask for ABA therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| and Aiden's board-certified behavior analyst participates in all IEP meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| At this point, three months after I asked the initial question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| the school system decided it needed to collect more data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| The third IEP meeting to answer the same question was today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| We were provided with a slew of support options, none included ABA, and we are reviewing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| There are four systemic failures I want to bring to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| First, KCS employees in a leadership position communicating false information to parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| and subordinates within their department, that false information resulting in a five-month delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| KCS does not have standardized written processes and procedures for requests such as mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| which also contributes to delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| KCS central office meeting parents with resistance when requesting implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| of the only approved therapy to treat that child's disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| This is a critical time in Aiden's educational development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| ABA therapy in the classroom will support Aiden's learning in the least restrictive environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| and enable successful educational outcomes for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| I encourage immediate action to explicitly allow ABA therapy in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| This cannot wait until next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| I offer my support to that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| Allison Pasternak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| I'm hoping I did not butcher your last name, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| Just state your name, county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Allison Pasternak, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| I'm also here tonight to discuss allowing private ABA therapy in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| I'm the mother of seventh grade twins at Farragut Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| one of whom has been receiving ABA therapy since the spring of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| At the time he began therapy, my son was exhibiting disruptive and at times destructive behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| due to an autoimmune condition which affected his brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| My son is also on the autism spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| I'm happy to report that my son is not currently exhibiting the negative behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| for which we originally sought ABA therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| He continues to participate in this therapy to address deficits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| which can make it difficult for him to function in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| Since my son is a student, his real world is the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| While ABA can be life-saving in cases of elopement and disruptive behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| it can also be life-changing in a child's ability to become independent in school and in society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| Unfortunately, the therapy my son needs to be a successful student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| is not provided by Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| During the 21-22 school year, my son missed 108 days of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| so that he could continue his therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| This year, we made the difficult decision to forfeit an entire day of therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| so my son could have more days at school to access the general curriculum and be around his peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| Even with this decision, my son is missing school two days per week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| and is on track to have a total of 72 absences this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| These absences are excused because the school was given and accepted documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| that this type of therapy is medically necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| The only reason we do not send my son to school daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| is because the school is not able to provide the support he needs in the form of ABA therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| nor will they allow his private therapist to work with him at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| We've been told that autism support services implement ABA practice in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| ABA is highly personalized and tailored to a learner's needs, abilities, and motivations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| It is then implemented for many hours per week by a registered behavior technician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| under the supervision of the BCBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Claiming unqualified staff implement ABA strategies is like saying a teacher with sensory toys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| implements occupational therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| It is not even close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| The special education teachers and education assistants are not qualified to implement these strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| and therapies even if they have the time and resources to do so, which we all know they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| My son's therapy is paid for by his insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| Regardless of the therapeutic setting, the insurance company will continue to pay for his therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| and it will cost Knox County schools nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| His therapy would be infinitely more successful if it were to be conducted in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| Therapists make every attempt to generalize these desired behaviors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| but a therapist cannot duplicate a classroom in a clinical setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| Having therapy at school, which surrounding districts allow and welcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| would enable my son to access his least restrictive environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| Jennifer Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3016)|
| 0:50:27| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Jennifer Rose, I'm here from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| I'm here today as a parent and also a professional in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| My son is six years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| He started kindergarten this year at Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| He has autism along with a few other multiple diagnoses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| We started ABA therapy for him when he was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| Since then, he's been doing 30 to 40 hours a week until school started this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| We had to decrease the amount of services we were doing in order for him to go to school and attend all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3057)|
| 0:51:05| He has not been able to have his services at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| We've asked when he was in pre-K and this year during IEP meetings several times for his RBT to be able to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3070)|
| 0:51:20| We've been giving numerous excuses or just plain out told no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| So I'm here because I've seen the impact that it makes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| the difference that it makes for the children that receive these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| It allows them to be in the general education setting, which is where we want our kids to be if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| It also changes their quality of life while increasing their skill acquisitions and their knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| but decreasing those behaviors that will maintain through into adulthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| It aligns with your 865 program that Knox County has started because it's not just for your younger children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3109)|
| 0:51:58| ABA is for all kids, adults who have autism or other neurological disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| By allowing these services in school, it can also align with the older kids to give some of those kids a chance to go into the 865 program that Casey has his vamped up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3125)|
| 0:52:18| to allow them that time to build those skills into adulthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| I've seen children who was out in RBT in school during this school year have went missing for upwards of 10 minutes, if not longer, while they were at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3145)|
| 0:52:38| The principal during the IEP meeting asked the parents to come up with a safety plan for their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3158)|
| 0:52:47| The child, two weeks later, eloped from the classroom, went missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| The SRO officer had to review video to find the kid in a field behind the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| This could have been stopped because this kid is also non-vocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| If he had an RBT there with him, the student that is non-vocal communicates at home in three to four words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3185)|
| 0:53:14| but with his RBT and a lot of prompting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| We cannot generalize this without being in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| ABA will also protect and cover the safety of our children while attending Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Tiffany Matthews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| Ms. Matthews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Just state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| Tiffany Matthews, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| My husband and I are the proud parents of four children, two of whom receive special education services under the eligibility of autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| We are zoned for the amazing New Hopewell Elementary School, our two oldest go to New Hopewell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| and our two youngest go to Fort Sanders Preschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| We might just be the only family in Knox County that has two children with one and one A's in the general ed setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| for over 20 hours per week listed on their IEPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| I do know that we are one of the few families who has this service at all in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| and the only others I know have got this service with the help of an advocate and or attorneys just like we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| We do not have a private ABA through insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| What we do have, though, is what a private ABA therapist in the schools helps provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| which is direct adult support in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| Paraprofessional support in the regular class is what all students with disabilities are entitled to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| unless there is data to show they cannot be satisfactorily educated in the regular classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| even with this supplementary support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| This means students with the most involved disabilities who can progress in their IEP goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| and access the general curriculum with an A, modified content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| push-in services by a special ed teacher, speech, OT, PT, music therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| The whole list of supplementary A's and services are supposed to be placed in the general ed classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| with those supports and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Regular education teachers are to endorse to teach alternate assessment courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| yet most do not even know how they are endorsed to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| Our oldest son, Josiah, who is in third grade in a regular education environment with one hour of pull-out to resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| just switched from no modifications to modified content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| and this is where I would like to tell you our greatest concern for him now and for our younger son, Jacob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| Jacob, who is like Josiah in preschool, knows all his letters, numbers, shapes, colors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| and some sight words in countries and capitals around the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| and therefore won't need modified content in kindergarten next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| But as autism impacts a student more once the work gets more abstract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| and requires a certain level of reading comprehension, like it does in third grade especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| modified content is what a student can receive, continue to be educated in a regular class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| alongside typically developing peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| So now, where are the modified materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| We have amazing teachers at New Hope Well, but they don't have the time or resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| to create what Josiah needs as third grade modified content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| I know KACS has provided other kids a service called Curriculum Material Preparation on IEPs in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| but apparently the law department argued that it doesn't need to be listed as a service anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| which means it doesn't get funding or staffing hours to create these modified curricular materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| We ask, where are the modifications that CDC teachers use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| Why can't we use those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| The shocking answer is that there aren't any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| which should make everyone in this room wonder what is being taught in CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| Please consider why KCS doesn't have modified materials available for each learning standard for each grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| if they have so many in the CDC program on modified content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| Please support our amazing teachers and students on modified content by following IEP teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| to again list Curriculum Prep Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| Ashley Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Just state your name, residence, and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Hi, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Ashley Wagner, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| I'm a board-certified behavior analyst that's licensed in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| I'm here today for the families I serve and for the many children within Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| that have been deemed medically necessary as requiring applied behavior analytic services in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| I would like to start off by addressing some common reasons that have been relayed to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| and the parents of Knox County students as reasons why ABA providers are not allowed in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| Reason number one, allowing outside ABA providers is a breach in confidentiality to other students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| This concern can very easily be addressed by having outside providers sign confidentiality agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| like many surrounding school districts that allow outside providers to come in, have us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| My question is why Knox County is operating differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Reason number two, Knox County already has behavior supports in place for students provided by a behavior team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| and therefore does not need support from outside therapists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| From my understanding, there are only five behavioral liaisons employed by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| Of these five, only three are board-certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| According to Knox County's website, 9,000 students are currently receiving special education services across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| Even if only 25% of the 9,000 students with IEPs have presenting behavioral concerns that require behavioral interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| this leaves a ratio of one behavioral liaison to provide and meet the individual behavioral needs to 450 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| This is an unreasonable and unrealistic task for one person to perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| With such high caseloads, monitoring the implementation of each individual BIP would be impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| Combine the lack of resources and sheer quantity of students needing these supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| Knox County, unfortunately, is not set up for success to meet the needs of their most vulnerable students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3535)|
| 0:59:03| Furthermore, based on a recent Knox County job posting for a behavioral liaison position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| a bachelor's level in education or other mental health-related field is only required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| This is not to say that a degree in these fields is not an accomplishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| but in order to meet the students of needs with those that may be exhibiting severe behaviors of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| that pose significant health and safety risks to themselves or others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| specific education and certification in ABA should be a requirement by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| just as it is a requirement by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| The board that oversees the certifications of BCBAs and RBT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| restricts the administrations of FBA in development and oversight of the implementation of BIPs to a BCBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3579)|
| 0:59:47| Anyone who engages in these practices without certification is not inherent to the BACB's Board Code of Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| FBAs and BIPs should not be conducted or developed by unqualified professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| I have even had a school psychologist tell me that conducting these assessments are out of their scope of competency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| Please, please allow us to help you, and most importantly, help these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| By allowing a child's personal ABA provider in the classroom, we can help bridge the gap between home and school environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| We are here for you all, we are already in the homes, and we are waiting for you all to just open the door for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| Thank you, Ms. Wagner. Kim Kredich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3624)|
| 1:00:34| Hi, I'm Kim Kredich. I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| I'm here to hopefully offer some good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| I was thrilled to hear at the work session Dr. Reiswick talk about a move forward to implement some recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3639)|
| 1:00:50| explore some options in changing practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| And I really hope that is, I feel that that was a genuine foreshadowing of good things to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| But I'd like to offer the quickest maybe start to that, that's easy, and that is to update your website for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3660)|
| 1:01:10| I would like to, if you go to the special education website, then you will see under programs and services some blue buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3670)|
| 1:01:20| And now what a lot of these moms have talked about is ABA therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| But I'll tell you that I know that a lot of them are told, oh, we have autism support, and that is the same thing, or that offers the same strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3686)|
| 1:01:37| Well, if you have autism support, why isn't it listed on one of these buttons here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| Because I'll tell you what is listed, and it doesn't even go to anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| You've got positive behavioral interventions and supports, and you click on it, and it just goes back to the homepage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3707)|
| 1:01:55| You go to social and emotional learning, it goes to the homepage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| Trauma informed, it goes to the homepage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| Why would you not have autism support, which you claim is offering the strategies that these parents have licensed BCBA, RBTs to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3724)|
| 1:02:15| And why wouldn't you list the three big programs that students get sent out of zone for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| That would be autism specialty classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| There's no definition for that, and yet they exist, like at Northwest Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3744)|
| 1:02:31| Extended resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| If a kid is over a certain amount of time, they can apparently get sent away from their zone school for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| And CDC, comprehensive developmental classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| These are the biggies right here, and yet there's not even a button for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| So I'd also like to point out that you've got occupational and physical therapy as a button, and also speech and language therapy, and there's no music therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3767)|
| 1:02:56| Well, I know that one student gets it, in this district at least, after two years of fighting and finally a lawsuit that within 30 days was settled, and you guys signed that contract for Knoxville music therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3776)|
| 1:03:10| Another part is it only says under child find ages three through five, and child find is preschool through 12th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| In fact, there's an intellectual gifted lawsuit that cites this link, and it still hasn't been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3797)|
| 1:03:24| So I'm hoping that in hopefully a new era, that transparency and correct information is the first start to improving our special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3804)|
| 1:03:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3815)|
| 1:03:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Jessica Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| Just state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| Jessica Thompson, Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| My name is Jessica Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| I've been a professional in the field of ABA for 15 years, both in Virginia and Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| I'm passionate about ABA and the success I've witnessed firsthand, especially in the school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| I currently oversee the client services for east and northeast Tennessee at Positive Behavior Supports Corporation, and over the last four years have spoken with educators, principals, director of educations, all over the state of Tennessee, especially in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3852)|
| 1:04:28| And most of the feedback I've received is, we'll take all the support we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| If confidentiality is the main reason for Knox County's district in terms of letting outside providers support their clients in their natural environment setting, then most providers are willing to sign any kind of confidentiality agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3873)|
| 1:04:48| We're open to specifying terms if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| As ABA providers, we're there to help support clients, your students, your staff, provide tools and intervention using evidence-based research focused on and dedicated to the success, progress, and overall well-being of clients and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3892)|
| 1:05:06| We are not there to judge or condemn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| A collaborative approach is in the best interest of all of our clients for coordination of care, generalization, and overall progress, with our main purpose being to fade services as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3908)|
| 1:05:21| When I moved to east Tennessee, there were only two companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| And that was mostly center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| Now there are tons of center-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| There's tons of in-home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| And the fact is that there are just too many students, children, and adults in need that qualify and that are approved ABA services just here in east Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3931)|
| 1:05:43| With the leading number coming from Knox County and an exponential amount of guardians requesting support, the need of ABA in Tennessee and in east Tennessee is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3943)|
| 1:05:53| And frankly, there are not enough providers in our area to support the number of children needing the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| Overseeing client services in this area, I'm well aware of the number of children that need services in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| Not to take into account the other children on waiting lists in other areas and the children here that have IEPs within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3964)|
| 1:06:14| And I think it's safe to say that even if Knox County had the five licensed behavior board certified analysts on staff, it still wouldn't be nearly enough oversight and training at the level deemed medically necessary or ethically required under the BACG Code of Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3974)|
| 1:06:27| We're here to support you and the school and the special education teams in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| We wouldn't require, you know, most of the services are funded by insurance, don't require us to remove students from academic time, nor the school district will need to pay for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=3993)|
| 1:06:42| We would work within the school each day and arrange the environment, help with the teachers to arrange the environment and the student effort success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=4002)|
| 1:06:50| We use a least intrusive prompt or hypervigilant extinguishing prompt dependency and are experienced in handling intensive maladaptive behaviors and don't use restraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=4010)|
| 1:07:01| Thank you. That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| All right. And just quickly before we adjourn, I know that just to mention, Mr. Myers isn't here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=4029)|
| 1:07:18| Unfortunately, he could not be here tonight, but I know he's watching from Nashville, I believe, or wherever he may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| So and, you know, just to reiterate, I am optimistic and was happy to hear your announcement on Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=4046)|
| 1:07:36| And I know that there's at least one mom we heard from tonight that was and I talked to earlier today and she was excited about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230209?start=4056)|
