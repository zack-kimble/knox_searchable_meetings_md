| 0:02:03| As you know, TSBA had to cancel the in-house training sessions that were scheduled for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| the spring, but they are offering three online sessions for us to utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| If you haven't registered for one of these yet, please call Terri if you need her for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=133)|

| 0:02:44| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=164)|

| 0:03:18| I'm extremely proud of this year's seniors and all their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| I've been particularly inspired by their perseverance in overcoming the unique obstacles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| that affected their final year of high school, and I look forward to celebrating with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| At the same time, we're working very hard to ensure that these ceremonies protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| health and safety of our school community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| Graduates will be provided tickets for up to four guests, and attendees will be expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| to follow precautionary guidelines such as physical distancing, wearing a mask or cloth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| face covering, and staying home if experiencing fever, cough, or other symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| And again, I'm really looking forward to seeing our graduates from June 8th all the way through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| June 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=237)|

| 0:04:01| I'd also like to highlight the next phase of our KCS at Home program, which launched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| The summer edition of KCS at Home is available on our website and includes packets and videos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| for students in grades pre-K through high school, as well as videos featuring Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Our goal is to help families access material that was missed in the spring and will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| reviewed in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| I'm very grateful for all the hard work of our teachers, our administrators, and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| central office staff that put into this initiative, and I hope our families will find it very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| I know that our students and families have many questions about the ongoing COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| pandemic and how it will affect the fall semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| We are monitoring the situation very closely in conjunction with state and local authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| and we have developed a three-part strategy to help shape our decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| First, we've created a survey to solicit feedback from students, families, and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| That survey is available on our website at KnoxSchools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| Second, we have established a task force of community members from each board district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| that will be led by Dr. Jerry Askew, president of the Alliance for Better Nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| We believe the task force will provide an additional layer of communication to guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| our planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| And finally, we'll be working with focus groups of students, teachers, principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| and parents to seek insight from multiple perspectives about the fall semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| Our goal is to be prepared for three possibilities when school resumes in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| Ideally, students and teachers will return to the classroom as normal while embracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| new safety measures such as physical distancing, but we're also preparing for two alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| The first is a hybrid approach in which students would attend school part-time and receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| in-person instruction from their teacher in a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| Instruction would be supplemented by a student's teacher with remote learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| This could possibly involve staggering student attendance to allow for physical distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| and also provide for some extra time for cleaning of school facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| The second alternative would be a strategy of full-time remote learning led by KCS teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| that covers new material and allows for graded assignments using electronic devices provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| through our one-to-one initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| We want to ensure that resources, plans, and procedures are in place so that the work of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| education does not miss a beat this fall, and I'm confident we'll be able to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| this goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Madam Chair, members of the board, this concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| And I missed a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| We needed to vote to approve the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| So, all in favor of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Now, we have the Great Schools Partnership, Knoxville Education Foundation update, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| I believe Jonathan Schoonover and do we have Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| And newly appointed Knoxville Education Foundation President Chris Letzos are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| Thank you for taking time to provide the board with an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Thank you so much, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| It's fun to say that for the first time for you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Sorry that it couldn't be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| I'm not the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| I'm just filling in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| For the interim for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Madam Interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Madam Interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| So, as Interim President of Great Schools Partnership for the past seven and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| months, we've been going through quite a bit of a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| So, really, if you rewind the clock about 18 months, we've been working to kind of negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| and work through the relationship with Great Schools Partnership and Project Grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| And so, those two entities together are transitioning together to become one new entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| You may have seen the announcement before, but it's called Knox Education Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| or Knox Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| We have all of the executive team for our staff is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| Going forward, I will be the Executive Director of Innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| It's one of the roles that Great Schools Partnership played in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| The other one that you're probably most familiar with is the community schools strategy initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| So, Cheryl Ball is here to kind of give an update on kind of things that we've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| over the past, really, the past couple months during this time of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| And then, Ronnie Chandler, Executive Director of Project Grad, is here to kind of update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| us on things with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Now, I want to introduce you to Chris Lettsos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Before I do those things, the biggest thing that's on the agenda in front of you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| now, or for next week, is looking, I think it's C5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| It's the transition of some of the two of the key MOUs that we have with you, both with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| community schools and then one for a data analyst position, where we're transferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=509)|

| 0:08:39| So, it's just basically a name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Hey, this was an agreement that we had with you here, and we're moving that over to Knox Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| You'll notice that the MOU that you guys have with Project Grad is not on the agenda because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| the Knox Education Foundation is actually utilizing the federal ID number of Project Grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| So, that continues as is because it's the same entity that is going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| So, that's the technical stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| I'll get that out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=545)|

| 0:10:40| attending 14 urban schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=640)|

| 0:10:52| Grad support is K through 16, kindergarten through post-secondary, focusing on career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| and college access through exposure, opportunities, experiences, resources, addressing barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| of basic needs, social and emotional stress, and providing post-secondary success coaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=663)|

| 0:11:14| just like the rest of the district and the world, we canceled several events, Movie U,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| campus tours and visits, the celebration dinners, summer institutes, including a new advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=680)|

| 0:11:30| We postponed the laptop telethon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| WATE has said that they do want to still do the telethon later in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| Just as others did, we had to move out of bewilderment and into the reality of long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| So we did a pivot, encouraging staff to pay attention to self-care and their own family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| while we provide continued support from a distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| We shifted to provide the essentials of survival for multigenerational families who were struggling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| many in unstable circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=720)|

| 0:12:44| and with graduating seniors, developed original content on the grad YouTube channel, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| a K-8 focus supporting KCS at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| We mailed encouraging postcards to every student at both high schools, participated in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| videos, helped deliver yard signs, and communicated with students who lost opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| On the post-secondary side, we supported those struggling with an online format, hosted a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| couple of virtual Hangouts to reduce isolation, stayed close to students who are on intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| because of a GPA dip, and provided crisis support to scholars on the verge of giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| up and to those who could not go home when campus closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Finally, we continue to inspire hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=804)|

| 0:13:49| over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| And in the meantime, the transition team has remotely been working through a thousand details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| to position Knox-Fed for a great launch so great work can continue and even greater things are ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=836)|

| 0:14:07| Thank you, Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Next up we have, her title before was the Vice President of Operations for Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| And under that, the biggest initiative that we have there is community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| So introducing now, again, you've met her before, but Executive Director of Community Schools, Cheryl Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=858)|
| 0:14:27| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Thanks so much for having us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| We started the community school initiative in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| And we've expanded to now have 16 community schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| There are really three main components to our model with the district that make it particularly successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| First is our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| We put a full-time site coordinator and part-time program assistant inside of each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| Even while schools have been closed, these site coordinators have been advocating and collaborating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| for the benefit of all community school families, particularly the most marginalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| The second component are the individual site steering committees, which are made up of parents, teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| and neighborhood stakeholders who have also continued to meet virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| These committees lead the identification of specific needs and targeted solutions for each community school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| In addition to serving as part of the leadership team for the school, our site coordinator works with partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| like Helen Ross McDabb, the health department, and our child care providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| But this team is coordinating with 275 partners across Knox County, which leads me to the third component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=933)|
| 0:15:43| our community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| These range from youth-serving, nonprofit, faith-based, neighborhood associations, businesses, social service organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| and a broad spectrum of volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| We average between 60 and 70 partners per community school across all 16 sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| During the challenge of COVID-19 and less than 48 hours, our team secured a network of community partners to assemble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| store, deliver, and distribute family meal bags across 17 of the sites where KCS was distributing student meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| Second Harvest provided the food, and more than 61,000 additional meals were distributed during those nine weeks to families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=977)|
| 0:16:27| With the help of more than 50 partners, including local farmers, our weekend backpack program has continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| and expanded significantly, both in number and to include a broader cross-section of supplies, groceries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| that includes fresh produce and eggs, and basic needs items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Our team is helping to lead the Tennessee Community School State Network with a focus on advocacy and best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| We're launching a new approach to our needs and assets assessment across all sites, and have continued to expand our data collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1011)|
| 0:17:00| We're very excited that we've initiated a third-party evaluation of community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| through the University of Tennessee Social Work Office of Research and Public Service, or SWRPS as they are locally known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1025)|
| 0:17:13| While the full evaluation process will clearly take a couple of years, we expect to have initial details to share soon, and we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1033)|
| 0:17:21| Toward the beginning of COVID-19, one of our site coordinators learned about a mother who is visually impaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| and was struggling not only with food, but frankly lost on what to do and how to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Our site coordinator worked with community partners to provide food and get this family referred to a number of other support systems in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| This also led to our team realizing the apartment complex of 12 homes where she lived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| they were really all suffering from food insecurity, and for many different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| She was able to utilize volunteers from a church and neighborhood association to package and deliver food to this complex weekly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| and plans to continue this at least through the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| That's just an example of peeling back the layers in the community development part of our work that impacts the entire community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| which definitely impacts that particular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| While none of us know exactly what school is going to look like this fall, clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| our team has been working to create new and innovative ways to continue our work on equity, collaboration, and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1100)|
| 0:18:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| Thank you, Cheryl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| I couldn't get the rest of the team to jump on the gray suit bandwagon, just the two of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| Last, I'd like to just, and I'm not going to have her say anything or else she would get really upset at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| and you don't want your financial person upset at you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| That is Stephanie Jenkins, if you just want to say hello and wave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| She served, really she served so many roles, but two official roles, both with Project GRAD and Great Schools Partnership for the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| what are we at now, 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| 16 and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| So I think she's really excited to have back to just one boss, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| We've kind of combined everything together, and she's excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Just a brief update on innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Won't spend long here, but just want to let you guys know that we've gone through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Great Schools Partnership has served essentially as a catalyst, think tank, research and development arm for Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| to help you guys do some of the innovative stuff that you can't do with public money and fail, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| We can fail forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| We can learn through things and go through innovation cycles to help kind of move things forward, test things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| If they don't work, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| We'll push them aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| If they do work, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| We'll move them forward and hopefully help you guys to adopt them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| The innovation team is really going to work forward to kind of move that whole initiative forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| So we've been working hard to develop some language around our innovation cycle, so looking at needs assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| where are the needs both within the school system, identified by the team that works so hard with you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| but then also from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| What are the needs of our community as well, and how do we take that through evidence-based best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| and then how do we contextualize that to here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| So, yeah, that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| It might work in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| How do we move that here to Knox County with our specific district, with our specific needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| and then implement that with a vision for essentially an evaluation plan at the outset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| Like when we finish this, we'll know what success looks like at the outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| So walking through that whole innovation cycle, implementation, and then the last step is to evaluate and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| hey, did it do what we thought it would do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Are we ready to implement this and kind of take this either district-wide or beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| or is this something that we need to go back to the drawing board and figure out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| That's something we're really excited to kind of moving forward with the innovation team to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| So innovation, community schools, project grad, all under one house, Knox Ed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| to be your one-stop shop to kind of support education within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1255)|

| 0:21:07| past couple months, the transition work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| If you've got any questions, feel free to all have my e-mail addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| Feel free to shoot me an e-mail, give me a call, shoot me a text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| and look forward to having you guys all interact with Chris as well as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| So thank you again for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Thank you so much, and we appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| And, Mr. Letzos, we look forward to working with you going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Now I want to make an announcement of the 2020-2021 Board of Education student representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| As Ms. Horn has informed us earlier, the process to select our board student representative for next school year started back in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| and she had the privilege of serving as our board representative on the selection committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| This year we had a total of 17 applicants from nine different high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| After a blind review and ranking of all 17 applications by the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| which included Ms. Horn, Secondary Education Executive Director Danny Trent, Principal Brad Corum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| current student representative Noah Kelly, and community member Angela Fisher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| the top four scoring candidates were moved through to the interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| The four finalists, who are all rising seniors, were Blake Cragen of Farragut High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| Mikayla Webb of Hardin Valley Academy, Abigail Lee of Elenin STEM Academy, and Kendall Patty of Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1338)|
| 0:22:27| On behalf of the board and the selection committee, I want to thank each of the finalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| The selection committee stated, as always, it was an extremely difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| Following the interviews of the finalists this past Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| the committee members totaled their interview scores with application scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| and I'm happy to introduce to you our Board of Education student representative for 2020-2021 from Elenin STEM Academy is Abigail Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1365)|
| 0:23:04| We will be sharing more detailed information about Abigail as she begins her term in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| but please help me congratulate and welcome her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| Also, thank you to Noah Kelly for showing Abigail the ropes tonight and next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| As we all know, this is Noah's final month with us, and we look forward to celebrating him next week at our regular session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| Now we will move on to our 2020 regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| Board members, just a reminder, if you want to speak, just pull down your microphone, flag me down if you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| We will start with the consent agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| Does anybody have any discussion on C1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| I think Mr. Dupler maybe wanted to make a comment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Board members, this item was approved by you in April, but when it was sent back to the company, Blackboard, they raised some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1433)|
| 0:24:04| They wanted their own agreement because this went through what we call a cooperative agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| A lot of those such agreements are used by local governments and public school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| So they did not want to use that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| They wanted their own agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| So we've spent probably the last 30 days going back and forth trying to create a specialized agreement that this board can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1459)|
| 0:24:28| We are very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| I had heard back from Blackboard representatives, I think, at 4 o'clock today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| So hopefully by tomorrow we will have something to put on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| But that's what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| I won't call it a skirmish, but it's a legal disagreement at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| We've almost got worked out, but it's the same terms and type of contract that you all approved in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1485)|
| 0:24:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Any discussion on C1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| C2 or C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| If we have someone here from school nutrition, could we hear a little bit about the difference in how students are approved for their meals through direct certification or through the applicant process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1505)|
| 0:25:21| I was thinking that it was a one or the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| But looking at the contract, it talks about both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| Ms. Foster, are you going to talk to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Direct certification students are those who are pre-qualified for benefits because they receive some type of service from the state, whether that be SNAP or TANF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1536)|
| 0:25:46| or if they're considered homeless, migrant, runaway, or foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| And that would be foster deemed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| And then our application process is based on income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| So if they don't fall into one of those categories and then they want to apply for benefits, they have to supply their income information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| I think there's been some confusion at some schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| They thought they had to direct certify and that they couldn't apply otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| So our CEP schools, typically all we look at is direct certification information because that's all we have to have to qualify them for community eligibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1572)|
| 0:26:21| But if it's not a CEP school, they can either be directly certified or apply for benefits through our income application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| What's a CEP school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1593)|
| 0:26:42| Community eligibility provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| We have 47 in our district, and they're usually the highest need schools in school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| And it's schools where all the children can eat at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| And that has to do with looking at the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| Direct certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Is it that you have a high enough percentage at that school that it qualifies them or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| So a school has to be at least 40% directly certified to qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| We group ours all together to increase that percentage for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| But for an individual school to apply, they have to be at least 40% directly certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Any other discussion on 2 or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| C, 4, 5, or 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| I'll take 5, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Yes, Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| I don't know who's going to answer questions about great schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| I guess it's John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I do have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| You may have already stated this, but I just wanted a little more pointed discussion, I guess, of why the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1673)|
| 0:28:05| Why exactly are you all changing your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| And apparently you're changing the structure under which great schools is operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| So I just wanted to try to get some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| So in regards to the structure, both boards for great schools partnership and project grad, both were looking at what can we do within our community to create a sustainable path for educational supports long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1700)|
| 0:28:35| So, like, we wanted something long term that would help our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| And it didn't make sense to have essentially two fundraising streams, you know, sources trying to go after funding for very similar programming and very similar strategies to support education within the same community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1720)|
| 0:28:54| And so through that process, we actually, if you rewind the clock about 6, 7 years ago, project grad and great schools partnership entered into a supporting organization relationship already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1734)|
| 0:29:07| So there were already structurally some things that involved where these two entities were involved with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| By definition, you know, the last year at this time, the great schools partnership president was by definition in the charter, the project grad board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1753)|
| 0:29:23| Great schools partnership did a lot of the fundraising for project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| So there were a lot of things that were cross over already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| And this was a way for our two entities to say, hey, look, is this, you know, we had this conversation determining the relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| Is this a time for us to go our separate ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| Is this a time for us to kind of come together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| What, you know, I think there were six different options that they looked at through this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| There was a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| We had some school representation on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| As you know, with great schools partnership, we actually have historic that we have had our positions of almost every one of our board members are ex officio board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1788)|
| 0:29:59| So they hold some other role and that makes them a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| So by default, the superintendent sits on the great had sat on the great schools partnership board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| The school board chair sat on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Both mayors sit on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| So it was it was all position positionally based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| As we looked at the new structure going forward, we want to make sure that we opened it up, not to just position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| So we still have some of the key positions that when you look at not said board structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| The first five positions are that are similar ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| We've got Superintendent Thomas is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| We've got both both Knoxville City and county mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| The school board chair is there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| And the county commission chair is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| So those are the five kind of ex officio positions that we'll keep there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Any point I'm boring you to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| There's a whole bunch of information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| We had a whole structure that is going to kind of continue over with board support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| But we wanted to also include more donor support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| So this is more about a move to make sure that we're sustainable long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| We were able to open up a few spots within the board structure of Knox Ed to allow us to kind of really make sure that we're sustainable long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1854)|
| 0:31:04| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| I guess another question regards funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| So in terms of how funding exists now, I mean, compared to what it was, I mean, what will the structure be funding wise funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1869)|
| 0:31:20| I mean, we the school board sent you money, which went straight to the to the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| It was basically a you were a pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| So I'll separate those into two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| So great schools partnership is a public private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| About half of the funding comes from public entities, which is primarily the county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| So the county government gives about two and a half million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Historically, the city government gives about four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| And then the rest of that is raised publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| So, you know, going to the private donors to raise that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| And that has been the responsibility of the president of great schools partnership historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| When you look at Project Grad, again, the responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| Project Grad is the one that had money flowing for everything from great schools partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| There was money flowing to you guys, if that makes sense, or services that were flowing to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| Project Grad, on the other hand, had money coming from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| And again, the history behind that, that's you guys have been there and seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| That still exists and that MOU still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| I think it's seven hundred thousand dollars that will come historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| It's come through great schools partnership to Project Grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| And now it's just to the same entity, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| So, and again, the rest of those dollars are raised privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you. Anybody else have a question for Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Hi, John. Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| So the money now that whatever that amount might be that Knox County Schools decides to contribute to the pot will go to the pot now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1970)|
| 0:33:06| Or is that money still specifically designated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| It's still specifically designated to Project Grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| And that was part of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| There is the ability within this new structure for entities, whether that's the government or whether that's private entities, to designate specific funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| But the negotiations through this process and this transfer into Knox Ed was that that $700,000 would be earmarked specifically for Project Grad to honor the MOU and the contract that you guys have with Project Grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2001)|
| 0:33:33| And so that Project Grad contract will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| It just will continue under the name Knox Ed because we're using the same federal BIN number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| And is there two more years on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Oh, that's a good question. Three more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Three more years. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| So after that time, then, if the board, you know, and I would imagine that we certainly would support, I was going to say great schools partnership, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2027)|
| 0:34:01| Knox Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Then we can still have a specific designee or we can say you all take it and use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2043)|
| 0:34:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| And the idea behind this, again, is that this isn't something that should be, hopefully, as we work with you guys, this is more of a relational based thing where we're working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2053)|
| 0:34:22| We already work hand in hand with your staff and spend a lot of time with the executive team and throughout the schools, the community schools and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| But hopefully, we'll even do that more so with you guys as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| We've been trying over the past couple of years to make sure that we invite you all to, if we have teacher for newer grants or we have whatever there might be that we're doing stuff in the school, that we have you guys part of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2073)|
| 0:34:44| And I hope that that would be a conversation that would be developed at the Knox Ed board meetings because, again, the school board chair, by definition, will sit on the Knox Ed board and have a voting position there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2084)|
| 0:34:57| And you've always, really, you have always done a great job with that community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| I mean, the campus managers, whatever you're calling them now, have always been very good to reach out to us individually and invite us for things as well as you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2102)|
| 0:35:16| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Thank you for what you all do to help this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| I have one little question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Are y'all's email addresses changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Can we get to Ms. Hill, maybe, for all of us, just the main contacts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| That would be probably helpful for all of us to make our contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Yeah, we can connect that through, I guess, through Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| I mean, not Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I'm sorry, Ms. Cody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| I was a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Same first name, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Same first name, wrong last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Close enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| So good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Okay, I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Any discussion on C7, 8, or 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2154)|
| 0:36:03| C10, 11, or 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2163)|
| 0:36:12| C13 or 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| Okay, now we will go to Board Policy 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Yes, I have just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| So I know that we are suspending this policy for the sake of COVID, which I fully support, and I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| I'm just curious, what will be the – what's the cost if we just disregarded the full amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| Like, what's the full amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Yeah, let me – Ms. Satterfield, if it's okay, let me call Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| I know we have a budgeted amount, but I'm not sure what that amount is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| I think Russ probably has it in his memory bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2212)|
| 0:37:02| As of today, the length of accounts we have are just more than $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| That's roughly what it runs on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| And Brett, jump in, correct me if I get this wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| What we normally see this time of year when we turn out for collection is that we'll see some marginal decrease in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2237)|
| 0:37:28| We may pick up $15,000 or $20,000 additional dollars, but it's still a significant hit to the general purpose budget each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2248)|
| 0:37:38| If I remember correctly, Ron, we've been budgeting in the neighborhood of $200,000 a year to cover that expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2258)|
| 0:37:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| Any other discussion of the board policy 7A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| Okay, grants, 8A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| Grants, C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| Grants, 7A, E or 7A, F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2291)|
| 0:38:20| 8G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| Okay, moving on to contracts, 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| Okay, now we're going to move on to regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| Regular agenda item 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| 10B, does Mr. Oaks want to let us know about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| As you all know, this was on the move from the agenda last week, and we're waiting, I think, on some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| This was deferred last month to this month because the county had asked us to hold on it until they completed a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2339)|
| 0:39:07| and that study is supposed to be completed by the end of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| I talked to Mr. Snowden this morning, and he was expecting to get a report on Friday, so we'll have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| We wanted to have this on the agenda so that if we need to do something different, we can make that decision before the voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2357)|
| 0:39:27| And if it's to pull it off, if that is the will of the board, then based on what the traffic study is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| I don't know or have any inkling at this point what's going to come back with the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| or what the county will find supportable off of that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| We are at a point right now, though, that if we elect not to take an action on this this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2386)|
| 0:39:55| we are in danger of not being able to open this school in the fall of 2022 just because of the timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2395)|
| 0:40:07| And also, right now, we've got within this contract a provision that we will close on it by the 30th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2407)|
| 0:40:18| And even where we stand today, even if the board decides they want to go forward with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| we may have to go back and renegotiate that closing date on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| Thank you, Mr. Oates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Ten C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| OK, public forum. We have no one registered for public forum this week, so we will go on to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2440)|
| 0:40:48| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| I'll miss you all so much. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| That didn't sound very convictful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| But it's been a pleasure over the last year getting to know all of you all and getting to see how the Board of Education works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| And I really appreciate the spirit experience. And I hope to keep in touch with all of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| I'm going to keep my fingers crossed. I'm going to school in the fall of Vanderbilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| But if not, I'll be around. So thank you all for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| You've been such a blessing. And I look forward to our paths crossing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Mr. Norman, Miss Hill, Miss Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| OK, that concludes our meeting. And thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200603?start=2491)|
