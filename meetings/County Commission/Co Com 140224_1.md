| 2:43:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9804)|
| 2:43:25| And I think what we decided at our meeting was to go ahead and schedule it for that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9805)|
| 2:43:29| but to schedule it for like half the day, for like two and a half or three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9809)|
| 2:43:35| I think so, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9815)|
| 2:43:36| And here instead of at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| We talked about UT briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| And doing it upstairs in the conference room instead of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| One hour of meeting and two hours of retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9825)|
| 2:43:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9826)|
| 2:43:47| So as long as the three of us are in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| since we're the majority of the Audit Committee, it shall be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9830)|
| 2:43:54| Yeah, we're three-fourths of it as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9837)|
| 2:43:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9838)|
| 2:43:59| So there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| March the 11th at 9A and 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9841)|
| 2:44:05| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| It brings up an issue I've been wanting to ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9849)|
| 2:44:13| I believe our charter law director, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| calls for three commissioners and two outside people from the different versions of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9857)|
| 2:44:29| Since one got ran off, we haven't heard anything about anybody else being suggested before us to put on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9869)|
| 2:44:37| So what's the progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| We are in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| The Audit Committee is in discussion of what books they're going to follow, red book, yellow book, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| And they need to hammer that out because and discuss the audit charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9889)|
| 2:44:55| because that association is with one of the books, and I can't remember which one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9895)|
| 2:45:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9903)|
| 2:45:04| Either yellow or red book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9904)|
| 2:45:05| That association won't be involved if we don't go with that red book, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| And we actually covered that in the Rules Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| We have to actually make that determination, and it also has to be in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| We talked about in the Rules Committee meeting whether or not we wanted two from the yellow book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| or just one from the yellow book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| And another internal auditor from another government, local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| And then we'll have a committee meeting on that day or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| So that's the discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9927)|
| 2:45:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| No other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| We're adjourned until 445.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9933)|

| 2:46:28| Can we read it into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| Would you read it into the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| Whereas the Fulton High School Marching Band has experienced tremendous growth over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9993)|
| 2:46:39| past six years, increasing from 19 students to 75 students, and is expected to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9999)|
| 2:46:45| to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10005)|
| 2:46:46| And whereas the Fulton High School Marching Band has competed in and won many marching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10006)|
| 2:46:51| competitions over the past few years and is beginning to be a consistent top finisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10011)|
| 2:46:56| And whereas this year the Fulton Marching Band's outstanding season was culminated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10016)|
| 2:47:01| receiving first place overall in Class 3A at the U.S. Band Southern State Championship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10021)|

| 2:47:22| and direction for the marching band's development and success this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10042)|

| 2:47:32| students, raises money for instruments, has brought new uniforms, is lobbying for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10052)|

| 2:48:45| program at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| They've grown it just exponentially, and they inspire these kids, and they put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10127)|
| 2:48:58| incredible programs for these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| Their shows are fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10141)|
| 2:49:04| And not only do the band director and the assistant band director work really hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10144)|
| 2:49:09| but these kids work amazingly hard, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| They practice during school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| They practice after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| They practice in the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| Not only do they perform at home games and away games and not just on the field at halftime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10157)|
| 2:49:23| but also in the stands to pep up the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10163)|
| 2:49:26| They travel on weekends out of town to band competitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10166)|
| 2:49:31| And as a former marching band participant, I can tell you those are a lot of fun, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10171)|
| 2:49:35| they're also an incredible amount of work, not just for the students and the band staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10175)|
| 2:49:40| but also for the parents and grandparents and community members who support these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10180)|
| 2:49:46| and go on these trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| And I could not be more proud to have the Fulton High School Marching Band in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10188)|
| 2:49:56| And also, as an added bonus, since I live down the street, I get to hear them rehearse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10196)|
| 2:50:02| after schools and on when they do the Thursday run-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| I get to hear that sitting on my front porch, and my whole family loves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10207)|
| 2:50:12| So I am so impressed with you guys and what you bring to Fulton, what you're doing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10212)|
| 2:50:18| these kids, just outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10218)|

| 2:50:24| Would either of you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10224)|

| 2:50:33| work at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| We represent one of many area high schools with outstanding music programs, and we hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10234)|
| 2:50:38| the best is yet to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| I would like to say we couldn't do it without Mr. Smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10240)|

| 2:50:58| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10261)|
| 2:51:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10262)|
| 2:51:03| I'd just like to add a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| I was accused earlier of being a homer for Fulton, but anyone that knows me knows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10266)|
| 2:51:11| I'm a roadrunner for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| So that, by definition, means I'm not a Fulton fan, but they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10273)|
| 2:51:19| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| Ouch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10281)|
| 2:51:22| I have seen Fulton's band over the years, and from where you all brought the band from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10282)|
| 2:51:30| you know, 10 years ago, there might be, what, 12-piece band, alumni folks in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10290)|
| 2:51:37| You all have really, I'm sure your predecessors helped, but you all have really taken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10297)|
| 2:51:43| Fulton High School marching band to that next level, as with all the programs over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10303)|

| 2:54:29| The next item is 11-A-13-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| It's an appeal by Steve Hobbs of MPC denial of his request to rezone from A Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10473)|
| 2:54:39| to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10479)|
| 2:54:40| The property is located north side of Hall Drive, southwest of Dutchtown Road in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10480)|

| 2:54:46| The applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10486)|
| 2:54:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10488)|
| 2:54:49| Arthur Seymour, Junior 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| I am here with the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| Before we get started, is there any opposition to the Dutchtown Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10498)|
| 2:54:59| Arthur, if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, this matter is here on an appeal from a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10501)|
| 2:55:07| by MPC of a request for a sector plan amendment and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10507)|
| 2:55:14| Under the rules and state law, the best the appellant and what we are asking for is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10514)|
| 2:55:23| you all direct MPC to consider an amendment to the sector plan to allow commercial on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10523)|
| 2:55:33| If I may, I've got Mr. Hobbs, his daughter, Ann Millsaps, and Mark Vandoren here with him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10533)|
| 2:55:42| The property is zoned Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| It's in a part of the county that is way out west and before the development of the parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10545)|
| 2:55:53| was a very rural part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10553)|
| 2:56:00| With the development of the parkway, the area has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| Hall Road runs between Dutchtown and Mayberry Hood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10563)|
| 2:56:09| Mr. Hobbs has been operating a bus leasing operation out there for 30 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10569)|
| 2:56:20| There was a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| We assume it's from a disgruntled employee who made claims with all the alphabet agencies after his discharge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10582)|
| 2:56:34| and Knox County Codes, too, which is not an alphabet agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10594)|
| 2:56:41| Mr. Hobbs' offense is that he will sell tires and parts for bus repairs to people to whom he leases buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10601)|
| 2:56:55| or who have buses parked on his storage yard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10615)|
| 2:57:01| He also sells buses, school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| I keep saying buses, but let me make sure I modify that with school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10624)|
| 2:57:11| In Knox County, a school bus can operate only for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10631)|
| 2:57:16| If it's been in service longer than that, it cannot operate within the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10636)|
| 2:57:23| Other school systems do not have that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| So he sells buses from time to time that may be out of date in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10646)|
| 2:57:31| but not out of date in Anderson or Jefferson or other counties or for non-school bus uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10651)|
| 2:57:39| School buses have a wide variety of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10659)|
| 2:57:45| Now, if you look at the MPC report, basically they were turned down because Hall Road is not very wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10665)|
| 2:57:53| It's 18 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| It's been 18 feet probably for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10675)|
| 2:57:59| There are other bus businesses operating on Hall Road in a commercial manner but on agriculturally zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10679)|
| 2:58:10| Mr. Hobbs is not aware of any accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10690)|
| 2:58:15| His next-door neighbor operates school buses, leases school buses to Knox County schools, Bill Mead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10695)|
| 2:58:25| He has directly across the road from him another commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10705)|
| 2:58:31| Mr. Mullins has a wreckage yard over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| There is also across the street from him another person who stores school buses on that site and presumably leases them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10715)|
| 2:58:47| MPC's sector plan shows this not to be allowed for commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10727)|
| 2:58:54| And that and the road seem to be the primary issues at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10734)|
| 2:59:01| We would ask that you all look at reality, what is on the ground there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10741)|
| 2:59:07| and ask MPC to consider an amendment to the sector plan to allow Mr. Hobbs to continue operating as he has for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10747)|
| 2:59:21| There are probably a number of other places like this in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10761)|
| 2:59:27| We were down here on the John Deere landscaping matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| They had been operating on Lovell Road for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10771)|
| 2:59:35| Last year I was down here on a project in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10775)|
| 2:59:39| The Camel Manufacturing Company apparently had had manufacturing facilities on agriculturally zoned property for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10779)|
| 2:59:49| You have the same situation on Hall Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10789)|
| 2:59:54| You have commercial operations that have been going on there for years with no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10794)|
| 3:00:01| The area has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| There is commercially zoned property in the area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10803)|
| 3:00:08| If you go to the west of Hall Road, you have a rather large office park, Century Park, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10808)|
| 3:00:17| If you go to the west, you've got a landscaping business that is zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10817)|
| 3:00:22| But Mr. Hobbs and his other neighbors on Hall Road are still zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10822)|
| 3:00:31| When he was cited, he talked to codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| It was suggested that he apply for CA zoning for this property, which he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10833)|
| 3:00:40| Unfortunately, he was turned down by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10840)|
| 3:00:47| There have been no complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| There was no one in opposition to this at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10849)|
| 3:00:53| I don't think anybody said they were in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10853)|
| 3:00:58| Today we are asking that the status quo be allowed to continue in this area and particularly with Mr. Hobbs' property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10858)|
| 3:01:10| I know MPC staff is opposed to this, but sometimes plans should recognize reality and what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10870)|
| 3:01:21| And I would suggest there is a very strong basis for amending the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10881)|
| 3:01:27| although I'm not asking you all to do that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10887)|
| 3:01:30| But the sector plan obviously overlooks reality because the businesses on Hall Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10890)|
| 3:01:36| have been in operation for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10896)|
| 3:01:40| and the sector plan has been amended several times during that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10900)|
| 3:01:45| So Mr. Hobbs is here to answer any questions about his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10905)|
| 3:01:50| He owns other property on Hall Road and leases that and has operated there without complaint for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10910)|
| 3:02:03| We'd be happy to answer any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| but we would ask you to consider requesting MPC to review the sector plan for Mr. Hobbs' property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10925)|
| 3:02:16| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10938)|
| 3:02:19| Have you asked for opposition yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10941)|
| 3:02:22| I don't think anybody stood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| There is no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10944)|
| 3:02:25| So I'd just like to make a motion, the motion that Arthur just recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10945)|
| 3:02:31| that this be reviewed by MPC to see its appropriateness for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10956)|
| 3:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10957)|
| 3:02:40| Do you have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10960)|
| 3:02:41| No, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10961)|
| 3:02:42| Got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10964)|
| 3:02:45| I'd just like to ask the MPC representatives, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10965)|
| 3:02:50| this is something that's been going on a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10970)|
| 3:02:54| Just as Mr. Seymour said, it's, you know, I've been reading too much law stuff now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10974)|
| 3:03:00| It's de facto, even though it's not there de jure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| You know, it's there by fact but not by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10983)|
| 3:03:07| And what was the argument against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10987)|
| 3:03:09| There's no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| It sounds like there's been commercial businesses all up and down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| They probably don't have any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| But what was the arguments presented at MPC other than you were caught in a legal bind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=10996)|
| 3:03:23| where it doesn't fit your sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| Well, there's several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11005)|
| 3:03:26| First of all, Hall Road is a local road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11006)|
| 3:03:30| It's 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11010)|
| 3:03:32| And generally, when you try to establish commercial zoning in an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| you want a road that's wide enough to handle contemplated commercial traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11016)|
| 3:03:42| Mr. Seymour points out the fact there may be other businesses in the area that are on agricultural zone land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11022)|
| 3:03:48| that may be businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11028)|
| 3:03:51| We're not convinced that that's a good reason to change the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11031)|
| 3:03:54| because you may have illegal businesses, other illegal businesses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11034)|
| 3:03:59| It should be pointed out to confirm that Mr. Hobbs does have use of this property for school bus storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11039)|
| 3:04:07| That's allowed in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11047)|
| 3:04:10| It was determined that he was grandfathered in and can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| So he already has use of the property, we feel, in a reasonable sort of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11054)|
| 3:04:19| Mr. Seymour also pointed out the fact that to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11059)|
| 3:04:22| you do have a sizable tract of commercially zoned property that's being developed a century apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11062)|
| 3:04:28| Well, the reason that commercial is appropriate there is that it's at a major interchange of a freeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11068)|
| 3:04:33| and I believe Dutchtown is at least a minor arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| So that's an appropriate location for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| You do have one little piece of commercially zoned property located to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11083)|
| 3:04:49| That was rezoned several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11089)|
| 3:04:53| We don't see any trend in this area to begin changing zoning to allow commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11093)|
| 3:05:00| If this were a use that requires commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| it needs to be in a location that is appropriate for commercial zoning and uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11103)|
| 3:05:08| Again, if there are other uses in the area that are being used for businesses on agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11108)|
| 3:05:14| they're more than likely illegal, and they need to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| And we're not convinced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11118)|
| 3:05:20| When he talks about reality, reality may be illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| and we're not convinced that you should change the sector plan for this particular use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11123)|
| 3:05:28| part of which is already legal on the site just to allow commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11128)|
| 3:05:33| and potentially begin a pattern in the area that may not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11133)|
| 3:05:42| I was going to go ahead and make a comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| You know, I know there sounds like there's some concerns about the road not being very wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11144)|
| 3:05:51| but, you know, it seems to me whether this is zoned agriculture or it's zoned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11151)|
| 3:05:58| is that the traffic patterns aren't going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| You have other businesses that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| and probably it's inevitable that if we stop one business from doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11163)|
| 3:06:09| and my understanding is that there have been tires and parts and things sold there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11169)|
| 3:06:16| It's just a matter of making it legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11176)|
| 3:06:20| and we had a disgruntled employee that made a complaint that led to all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11180)|
| 3:06:24| Otherwise, probably things would have been going on the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| and we're almost opening the door to where we're going after a lot of these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11187)|
| 3:06:32| And, you know, to me, I think that all we're doing is we're just changing the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11192)|
| 3:06:37| We're not going to be changing anything else, and it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11197)|
| 3:06:41| A lot of these have been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11201)|
| 3:06:44| And I'm going to be voting to amend the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11204)|
| 3:06:51| or send it back to amend the sector plan for this so these businesses can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11211)|
| 3:06:56| Commissioner Brown, are you off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11216)|
| 3:06:59| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11221)|
| 3:07:02| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11222)|
| 3:07:03| First of all, Arthur, how long has he been doing business there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11223)|
| 3:07:10| Almost 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11230)|
| 3:07:13| Well, the part of it that is, quote, illegal is not the fact that he has storage there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11233)|
| 3:07:18| but the fact that he is selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11238)|
| 3:07:20| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11240)|
| 3:07:21| Selling to other drivers who have buses on the parts, tires, and doing some maintenance on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11241)|
| 3:07:28| So how long has he been doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11248)|
| 3:07:33| Ten or 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| So we have a business that's been operating for this is not something that's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11255)|
| 3:07:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11259)|
| 3:07:40| I mean, this has been going on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11260)|
| 3:07:41| And my examination would show that none of the other businesses are new there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11261)|
| 3:07:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11267)|
| 3:07:48| And do you have an idea of how many other people might be doing business there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11268)|
| 3:07:52| I'm familiar with the area, but not the specific parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| Would you say five, ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| I'm not going to hold you to a specific number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11277)|
| 3:07:59| There's his adjoining property owner, Mr. Meade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11279)|
| 3:08:02| Now, whether he's doing maintenance and selling parts, do you all know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11282)|
| 3:08:06| He's pulling maintenance on his own stuff is mainly all he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11286)|
| 3:08:10| Mr. Seymour, we need his name, address, and he needs to step up to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11293)|
| 3:08:14| Steve Hobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11294)|
| 3:08:15| Give your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11295)|
| 3:08:16| 3037 Dixie Lee Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11296)|
| 3:08:20| And right across the street is Moon Mullins, who looks to be running a salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11300)|
| 3:08:27| And there's a lot next to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| I can't tell exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| That belongs to Moon, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11311)|
| 3:08:32| Mr. Mullins is grandfathered in on the selling junkyard parts and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11312)|
| 3:08:40| These are existing commercial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11320)|
| 3:08:42| Well, Moon's been in business a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11322)|
| 3:08:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11324)|
| 3:08:45| That's Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11325)|
| 3:08:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11326)|
| 3:08:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11327)|
| 3:08:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11328)|
| 3:08:49| Well, I'm going to be voting in favor of this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11329)|
| 3:08:50| I mean, the man's been in business for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11330)|
| 3:08:51| I mean, so, you know, I don't see that there's a need for us to basically shut you down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11331)|
| 3:08:57| and say, well, you can't do business when you've been doing it for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11337)|
| 3:09:00| So I'm going to be voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| I appreciate that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11343)|
| 3:09:04| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11344)|
| 3:09:07| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11347)|
| 3:09:08| Well, I guess I'm just looking at it from a different lens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11348)|
| 3:09:10| So it sounds like every other business is operating legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11350)|
| 3:09:16| Buzz, is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11356)|
| 3:09:19| I can't confirm it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11359)|
| 3:09:22| Arthur says there are other businesses in the area that are apparently on Agricultural Zone property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11362)|
| 3:09:28| that are businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11368)|
| 3:09:30| I can't confirm they're legal or illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11372)|
| 3:09:33| Well, I just heard of grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11373)|
| 3:09:34| The Mullins might be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11374)|
| 3:09:36| It sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11376)|
| 3:09:37| Storage was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11377)|
| 3:09:38| Storage is grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11378)|
| 3:09:39| Storage is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11379)|
| 3:09:40| And the bus part of Mr. Hobbs' business is grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11380)|
| 3:09:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11385)|
| 3:09:46| He just can't sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11386)|
| 3:09:47| He can't sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11387)|
| 3:09:48| And it sounds like the other guy isn't selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11388)|
| 3:09:49| So I guess I'm looking at this from a different lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11389)|
| 3:09:53| I don't think we're going to put a lot of people out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11393)|
| 3:09:59| I guess I'm just trying to stick to what we, you know, how we're zoned and at least go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11399)|
| 3:10:07| So my question is, say we send this back, and this is maybe to Mark and Buzz, what happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11407)|
| 3:10:16| If we send this back, what have we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11416)|
| 3:10:20| By sending this back to MPC, you're essentially initiating your own plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11420)|
| 3:10:27| And state law says that when you do that, it has to go first to the planning commission for a recommendation before you act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11427)|
| 3:10:36| When it does come back to you, you don't have to follow any recommendation from the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11436)|
| 3:10:41| They simply have to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| I guess this is, I mean, I think we need to tread lightly because if it comes back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11445)|
| 3:10:51| I want to say we need to have Mr. Hobbs and Mr. Mullins and the rest of the guys widen the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11451)|
| 3:10:55| Since we got all these buses and all these great large things going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11455)|
| 3:10:59| then they need to pay to widen the roads to make it more commercialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11459)|
| 3:11:03| Since all power will be in our hands, I guess we can set things, you know, the way we like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11463)|
| 3:11:10| And I don't know if we're the best body to start doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11470)|
| 3:11:14| So I'm not going to support this appeal because it sounds like we've, you know, we're not putting anyone out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11474)|
| 3:11:28| This is a new aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| This is, okay, I can sell my stuff now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11489)|
| 3:11:31| That's a different business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11491)|
| 3:11:32| We're not putting bus storage out of business, which was his core project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11492)|
| 3:11:38| This is something that grew out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11498)|
| 3:11:40| I think if we start allowing these splinters to continue, we'll be ‑‑our roads just can't handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11500)|
| 3:11:47| We're not designed to have these, you know, smaller roads to just kind of people do what they want on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11507)|
| 3:11:55| So this might be a bad precedent that we may set here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11515)|
| 3:12:00| So for that reason and that reason alone, there's nothing personal against this particular piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| But I guess I just don't see the need for us to go against MPC on this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11526)|
| 3:12:12| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11532)|
| 3:12:14| Yeah, I'm going to have to back MPC staff on this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11534)|
| 3:12:18| I understand that there are a lot of people in that area who are apparently operating businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11538)|
| 3:12:25| and have for a long time, but not in a legal manner as we require everyone else in Knox County to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11545)|
| 3:12:34| And I'm not inclined to ‑‑ you know, I'm more inclined to ask codes to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11554)|
| 3:12:40| and check and see who else is operating illegally along that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11560)|
| 3:12:47| and see what needs to be done about that rather than saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11567)|
| 3:12:53| you've been out there operating illegally for so many years, so we're just going to let you keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11573)|
| 3:12:58| We don't do that for other businesses in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11578)|
| 3:13:04| And I understand MPC staff's concerns about the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11584)|
| 3:13:08| and about the emerging commercial corridor in another area that's more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11588)|
| 3:13:14| So ‑‑ and I agree with Sam that this would be setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11594)|
| 3:13:19| could be a precedent that might come back to bite us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11599)|
| 3:13:23| So I'm very sorry, but I don't think you have much to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11603)|
| 3:13:30| I'm usually in the minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11610)|
| 3:13:33| If I may add, the commission apparently felt the same as at least when they reviewed it back in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11613)|
| 3:13:41| had the same view as the staff did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| They voted 13 to 1 to deny the plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11623)|
| 3:13:49| Commissioner Norman, the clerks would like for you to repeat your motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11629)|
| 3:13:54| The motion is to have MPC consider the appropriateness of a commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11634)|
| 3:14:05| and change to an amendment to the sector plan to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11645)|
| 3:14:13| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| Who seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11659)|
| 3:14:20| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11660)|
| 3:14:23| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11663)|
| 3:14:24| This is really, having looked at the way this place looks out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11664)|
| 3:14:31| what's the distance between, what's the length of Hall Road right there between Dutchtown and Maybury Hood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11671)|
| 3:14:43| Between a quarter of a mile and three‑eighths of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| It's a very short road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11686)|
| 3:14:48| It goes from the 9900 block to the 1100 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11688)|
| 3:14:53| Oh, I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11693)|
| 3:14:54| I can look at it, but I couldn't figure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11694)|
| 3:14:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| And this is about midway of that, so it's relatively short distance to either road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11699)|
| 3:15:06| And school buses have used that without incident for 25, 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11706)|
| 3:15:11| going in and out of these bus parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11711)|
| 3:15:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11721)|
| 3:15:22| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| I don't want to put the brakes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11724)|
| 3:15:31| MPC made a good point earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| and I just want to clarify the intent of the motion is to initiate a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11733)|
| 3:15:38| not to have MPC report back about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| they basically made a determination about what they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| I think the intent of your motion is to initiate a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11746)|
| 3:15:50| so that once the commission determines that they want to adopt the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11750)|
| 3:15:55| that they can reconsider the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| At the same time, I just wanted to make sure that that was the intent of the motion for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11758)|
| 3:16:04| And this rezoning can sort of ride on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| until the MPC considers our initiation of its sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11767)|
| 3:16:13| and they can come back at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11773)|
| 3:16:18| Clear as mud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11778)|
| 3:16:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11780)|
| 3:16:21| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11782)|
| 3:16:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11783)|
| 3:16:24| And oppose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11784)|
| 3:16:27| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| Motion passes 9-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| It goes back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| The next item is 12-H-13-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11795)|
| 3:16:39| It's an appeal by Masana Investments, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| of MPC's denial of their request to rezone from BP Business and Technology and TO Technology Overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11802)|
| 3:16:48| to PR Plan Residential and TO Technology Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11808)|
| 3:16:52| The property is located south side of Coward Mill Road, northeast of Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11812)|
| 3:16:57| in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11819)|
| 3:17:02| Applicants here and oppositions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11822)|
| 3:17:06| And so what we'll do is I'm going to make a motion just to get the discussion started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11826)|
| 3:17:15| And I'm going to make a motion to deny the appeal just to get the discussion started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11835)|
| 3:17:21| and there needs to be a good discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11843)|
| 3:17:25| Scott, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11845)|
| 3:17:27| Mr. Davis, if you want to speak to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11847)|
| 3:17:30| Yeah, I'll yield to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11852)|
| 3:17:33| Is there anybody in the audience that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11853)|
| 3:17:36| If you want to come up, what we'll do is we'll take a couple of people, five minutes apiece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11856)|
| 3:17:42| and just kind of state your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11862)|
| 3:17:43| You've stated them in e-mails to us, but if you want to make an argument or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11863)|
| 3:17:51| I'll just need your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11871)|
| 3:17:54| Andrew Simonario, 2621 Reagan Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11874)|
| 3:18:04| I guess you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| First of all, thank you to the commission for taking my e-mails, responding to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11887)|
| 3:18:14| I really do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11894)|
| 3:18:16| I've been in Knoxville for 18 years, moved out to this area about 10 years ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11896)|
| 3:18:25| Basically, why I'm here before you tonight is to share concerns about the rezoning of the Carl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11905)|
| 3:18:31| and Ginger Butler property from commercial property located in Technology Corridor to high-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11911)|
| 3:18:40| five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11920)|
| 3:18:43| There are basically 22 homes that are directly or immediately affected by this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11923)|
| 3:18:51| They're located on Coward Mill, and they're basically single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| and they're anywhere from one home to one acre or one home to five-plus acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11935)|
| 3:19:08| There are three subdivisions about approximately one mile from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11948)|
| 3:19:15| All those subdivisions are a zoning density of 2 to 2.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11955)|
| 3:19:27| The roads in the area are not designed to handle increased traffic of 40 homes, two vehicles per home on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11967)|
| 3:19:39| It causes an unsafe condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11979)|
| 3:19:43| And most of all, it changes the whole landscape of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11983)|
| 3:19:49| This area is basically, if you look at it, it's a sub-area of itself where it's basically small farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11989)|
| 3:19:59| We have cows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=11999)|
| 3:20:00| We have horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12000)|
| 3:20:03| It was never designed the way it is now to handle that kind of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12003)|
| 3:20:09| I think all the people here tonight are not unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| We know that an agreement can be made, and this property will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12012)|
| 3:20:17| But what is unreasonable is to change the zoning from basically a place where the community has been for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12017)|
| 3:20:30| which is one home site to a multi-dwelling area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12030)|
| 3:20:48| I'm sitting here, and I'm trying to think of something really smart to say, but basically three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12048)|
| 3:20:54| The streets are not designed for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12054)|
| 3:20:57| It's not compatible zoning for what's there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12057)|
| 3:21:02| And basically, it causes an unsafe condition by putting a lot of traffic on curvy and very narrow roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12062)|
| 3:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12072)|
| 3:21:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| Is there anybody else from the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12075)|
| 3:21:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12076)|
| 3:21:18| Just name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12078)|
| 3:21:20| Good evening, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12080)|
| 3:21:22| My name is Frederick Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12082)|
| 3:21:23| I live at 1043 Laurel Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12083)|
| 3:21:28| I reside in Magnolia Point Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12088)|
| 3:21:31| I am its current HOA president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12091)|
| 3:21:34| Magnolia Point Community is in the proximity of the land in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12094)|
| 3:21:38| It is located off Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12098)|
| 3:21:41| First, I want to thank the Commission for the opportunity to present my thoughts and concerns in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12101)|
| 3:21:47| I have prepared a written statement that I would like to read into the record and offer for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12107)|
| 3:21:53| This statement reflects the thoughts and opinions of many of Magnolia Point's residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12113)|
| 3:21:57| as well as other residents living in the affected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12117)|
| 3:22:02| I have reviewed the appeal and associated documents for rezoning in the land that are in question to residential status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12122)|
| 3:22:10| I fully agree and support MPC's denial and their justification for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12130)|
| 3:22:16| I believe that it is important to keep the lands now designated for use as Technology Corridor Lands Reserve Facility for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12136)|
| 3:22:23| The Technology Corridor Overlay Plan is still viable and important to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12143)|
| 3:22:29| and will bring jobs and opportunities to citizens and revenues to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12149)|
| 3:22:34| As long as other lands are available for residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12154)|
| 3:22:39| we should not even encroach on the corridor designated lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12159)|
| 3:22:44| However, if the Commission deems it necessary to reverse the MPC's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12164)|
| 3:22:49| and rezone the land in question to residential status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12169)|
| 3:22:54| I believe the rezoning should be restricted to no more than 2.5 detached family homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12174)|
| 3:23:01| A density limit of 2.5 is in keeping with the homes and properties in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12181)|
| 3:23:05| It will mitigate to the added traffic to Coward Mill Road and the increased burden on the utilities and local schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12185)|
| 3:23:13| It should be noted that Coward Mill Road is really more of a winding narrow lane with sharp curves and elevation changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12193)|
| 3:23:20| This road already has safety concerns and is at its traffic limit now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12200)|
| 3:23:25| Adding traffic to this road will only add to these problems and is of great concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12205)|
| 3:23:30| The private properties in the area of Coward Mill and Reagan Road compromise of four residential communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12210)|
| 3:23:37| three of which are of a density of approximately 2 to 2.5, as previously stated, units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12217)|
| 3:23:43| with the fourth being multi-acre properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12223)|
| 3:23:46| The rest of the private properties in this area is a mix of multi-acre residents and agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12226)|
| 3:23:53| People who live in this area live here because the area is low density and has rural appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12233)|
| 3:23:58| but yet is easily accessible to city conveniences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12238)|
| 3:24:02| A lot of money and effort has been spent by the residents to establish this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12242)|
| 3:24:07| and we want to keep its unique charm and appeal intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12247)|
| 3:24:11| Restricting residential development to no greater than 2.5 units per acre of detached individual dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12251)|
| 3:24:18| with no income-bearing properties allowed will be in keeping with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12258)|
| 3:24:26| This being said, it is my hope and the hope of the residents that I have talked to, which are many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12266)|
| 3:24:31| that the commission will uphold the MPC's denial for rezoning as we feel is the proper decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12271)|
| 3:24:37| and serves best the interests of the Technology Corridor Overlay Plan, Knox County, and the residents in the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12277)|
| 3:24:45| Once again, I want to thank the commission for listening to our thoughts and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12285)|
| 3:24:49| and hope they will incorporate them in their final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12289)|
| 3:24:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12292)|
| 3:24:53| Can I ask you one question before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12293)|
| 3:24:55| Both folks have said that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| I want to make sure I'm interpreting the same thing that you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12297)|
| 3:25:00| You understand that the property is up for redevelopment, whether it's today or five years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12300)|
| 3:25:06| But you want it to be, if it does redevelop, your preference would be that it's similar to Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12306)|
| 3:25:11| and similar to what's around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12311)|
| 3:25:14| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12314)|
| 3:25:15| Our main priority is to keep it in the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12315)|
| 3:25:21| I think that's where the property would serve best, and I agree with the finding of the MPC on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12321)|
| 3:25:27| However, if it is determined that it will be changed to a residential, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12327)|
| 3:25:33| it has been proposed that it does so, what, about five units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12333)|
| 3:25:37| And we think that is way too much for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12339)|
| 3:25:40| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12340)|
| 3:25:41| And considering that, and look, and we're thinking, okay, the other is 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12341)|
| 3:25:45| I'm thinking you'd probably add about 20 homes at 2.5, which means maybe 40 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12345)|
| 3:25:52| That's a lot to that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12352)|
| 3:25:55| If any of you folks travel it, but it's hard just to pass two cars on that road at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12355)|
| 3:26:01| especially if you've got an SUV and a pickup truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| So you've got to think about, as we're thinking about that, also the impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| I just want to make sure I was interpreting what I was hearing correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12368)|
| 3:26:10| Did I answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12370)|
| 3:26:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12371)|
| 3:26:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12372)|
| 3:26:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12373)|
| 3:26:14| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12374)|
| 3:26:15| Any questions of this gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12375)|
| 3:26:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12376)|
| 3:26:17| Well, I thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12377)|
| 3:26:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12378)|
| 3:26:19| Anybody else on the opposition side would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12379)|
| 3:26:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12383)|
| 3:26:24| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12384)|
| 3:26:26| Neil Caldwell, 10428 Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12386)|
| 3:26:30| I've been there for 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12390)|
| 3:26:33| We had a farm that was developed for five acres per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12393)|
| 3:26:41| And so the entire farm was you had no less than five acres per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12401)|
| 3:26:48| The three closest lots to this are eight acres for a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12408)|
| 3:26:56| and two of them that are seven acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12416)|
| 3:27:03| We were going to have a heavy-density subdivision on the other side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12423)|
| 3:27:11| We bought the option from the owner and changed it to 16 houses in 60 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12431)|
| 3:27:19| instead of 300 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12439)|
| 3:27:22| Most of the houses in those areas are over a million dollars apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12442)|
| 3:27:27| It's very low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12447)|
| 3:27:28| It is a unique area, and this is totally inappropriate to what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12448)|
| 3:27:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12455)|
| 3:27:42| 10-428 Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12465)|
| 3:27:46| My name is John Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12466)|
| 3:27:47| I live on 10-518 Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12467)|
| 3:27:50| Mr. Caldwell has been around 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12470)|
| 3:27:52| I'm a newbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12472)|
| 3:27:53| I've been there about 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| But I've got eight acres, and I joined the property that's in question here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12475)|
| 3:28:00| My family has a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12480)|
| 3:28:02| My family has been in business in Knoxville since 1968.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12482)|
| 3:28:06| I understand development and surely have no issue with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12486)|
| 3:28:10| as long as it's consistent with the community of where that development occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12490)|
| 3:28:14| So I realize it's going to be developed, and I really have no issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12494)|
| 3:28:21| I just am in agreement with everyone else here that two and a half seems real reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12501)|
| 3:28:27| I live on eight and a half acres next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12507)|
| 3:28:30| I'd love for one house to be there, but I think that's a little unreasonable to request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12510)|
| 3:28:34| So if you all would consider that if it does change from the corridor to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12514)|
| 3:28:40| that it would be two to two and a half per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12520)|
| 3:28:43| Just be consistent with your decision and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12523)|
| 3:28:47| That's all we ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12529)|
| 3:28:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12530)|
| 3:28:53| Scott, does anybody want to question the opposition, or do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12533)|
| 3:28:59| One more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12539)|
| 3:29:00| Okay, we'll go with one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12540)|
| 3:29:13| Thank you very much for giving me this chance to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12553)|
| 3:29:16| I'm Howard Friedman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12556)|
| 3:29:17| I live on Hawk Haven Lane, which is a little lane that runs off of Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12557)|
| 3:29:23| I just wanted to point out that while we're here as a pretty sizable contingent of residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12563)|
| 3:29:31| we did circulate a petition in the area and have 219 signatures of residents within a mile of this proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12571)|
| 3:29:44| that are asking for low-density zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12584)|
| 3:29:52| The attorney before was asking you to address the reality of a road situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12592)|
| 3:30:00| The reality of Coward Mill is that it is only 15 feet wide, not 18 feet that was quoted before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12600)|
| 3:30:11| It's a very dicey road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| We had the engineers come out to address that, which they did, and they did make some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12613)|
| 3:30:19| They did agree that it was a dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12619)|
| 3:30:22| I think the Metropolitan Planning Commission has estimated that those additional houses would add 477 cars per day on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12622)|
| 3:30:36| I ask you to consider that and to consider the petition, which I hope you all have received via email today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12636)|
| 3:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12643)|
| 3:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12646)|
| 3:30:50| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12650)|
| 3:30:55| Thank you all very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12655)|
| 3:30:56| I know it's been a long day, and you guys are ready to get out of here, and I'll try to make it as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12656)|
| 3:31:01| As you all are well aware, the technology overlay zone has been there for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12661)|
| 3:31:07| It incorporates over 7,000 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12667)|
| 3:31:10| We had all hoped and wished it was going to develop like the research triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12670)|
| 3:31:14| Unfortunately, that has not come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12674)|
| 3:31:17| And I apologize because the only adjacent property owner that was next to the property is Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12677)|
| 3:31:23| and I did send Mr. Johnson a letter introducing myself, letting him know who I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12683)|
| 3:31:27| I did not realize we were going to have the opposition here today that we have because I had not heard from anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12687)|
| 3:31:32| And it actually sounds like we're very, very, very close to being able to reach a reasonable compromise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12692)|
| 3:31:37| I did not hear anybody say that they were against residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12697)|
| 3:31:42| In the BPTO, and I don't think people quite understand this, in the BPTO, the use of the list of permitted uses is very extensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12702)|
| 3:31:54| from professional business, government, medical offices, hospitals, clinics, medical and dental offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12714)|
| 3:31:59| assembly of electronics, research, development, manufacturing, compound processing, packaging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12719)|
| 3:32:04| manufacturing, compounding, assembly, manufacturing of electric components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| manufacture of motor vehicle parts, manufacture, manufacture, manufacture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12728)|
| 3:32:12| There's a whole lot of stuff that can go there, banks, credit unions, drugstores, demolition landfills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12732)|
| 3:32:18| and less than one acre if it's permitted on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12738)|
| 3:32:21| I don't think people realize what can go on the property as it sits today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12741)|
| 3:32:27| Coward Mill Road from the property to Pellissippi Parkway, which is about a quarter of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12747)|
| 3:32:33| at the most narrow point of the property is 18 feet wide and 23 feet wide as you get closer to Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12753)|
| 3:32:39| It's my understanding from Knox County Engineering that they will not stripe a road with yellow and white lines unless it is a minimum of 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12759)|
| 3:32:47| That road is striped from the property to Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12767)|
| 3:32:52| And if I'm understanding the audience here correct that's in opposition to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12772)|
| 3:32:56| I didn't hear anyone say that they're in opposition to planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12776)|
| 3:33:03| I'm willing to accept a lesser density at 3.5 units per acre and we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12783)|
| 3:33:14| And I don't know if the residents fully and completely understand what could go there today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12794)|
| 3:33:19| which would be heavy commercial or hospital or heavy traffic generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12799)|
| 3:33:25| But I would like to yield for just a moment for the family to let them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12805)|
| 3:33:30| This is also a property rights issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12810)|
| 3:33:31| This family has owned this property for over 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12811)|
| 3:33:35| They're trying to settle the family's estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12815)|
| 3:33:36| It's been on the market for over a year with no offers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12816)|
| 3:33:39| The county would like to, quote, inventory this property, hoping that a business, a hospital or something may show up later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12819)|
| 3:33:46| which is restricting this family from being able to sell their property and settle their estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12826)|
| 3:33:50| But if you all would like to come up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12830)|
| 3:33:59| Hello, I'm Gail Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| This is my sister, Patty Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12841)|
| 3:34:04| Could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12844)|
| 3:34:07| Gail Cox, 10528 Cowards Mill Road, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12847)|
| 3:34:15| My sister, Patty Saunders, same address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12855)|
| 3:34:20| We're the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12860)|
| 3:34:21| We've inherited it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12861)|
| 3:34:22| My grandparents bought this farm in 1958.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12862)|
| 3:34:26| I lived there with my grandparents from that day forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12866)|
| 3:34:30| This is not something that we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12870)|
| 3:34:33| This is something that has happened to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12873)|
| 3:34:38| We've gone through a very emotional time making this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12878)|
| 3:34:43| Mr. Davis is the first person that has came to us after this property was put on market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12883)|
| 3:34:48| and made an offer to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| Myself personally, I'm thankful that it would be residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12891)|
| 3:34:55| and children back out there playing again like it's supposed to be instead of a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12895)|
| 3:35:01| This is not easy, you all, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12901)|
| 3:35:07| Our parents, my grandfather set this up for the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12907)|
| 3:35:13| My parents both became very, very sick, and all the money had to be spent for their care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12913)|
| 3:35:19| This is what we have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| We didn't want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12921)|
| 3:35:23| If I had my way, I'd be living out there, me and my sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12923)|
| 3:35:28| But we have no choice now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12928)|
| 3:35:30| We cannot afford to keep this farm up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12930)|
| 3:35:33| The land taxes, the maintenance, the mowing, this is a lot of work on two women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12933)|
| 3:35:39| and we're not spring chicks anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12939)|
| 3:35:42| This is a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12942)|
| 3:35:43| We do not have the income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12943)|
| 3:35:46| The income went for our family's care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12946)|
| 3:35:49| And I'm sorry if all these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12949)|
| 3:35:54| I just don't understand what my family has been through and how hard a decision this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12954)|
| 3:36:00| It rips our heart out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12960)|
| 3:36:02| I have cried a river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12962)|
| 3:36:03| My sister has added to that river in coming to the decision to put the farm up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12963)|
| 3:36:09| But reality was reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12969)|
| 3:36:13| And now I feel like we're having to grovel just to settle what our family had left to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12973)|
| 3:36:20| to be able to maintain ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12980)|
| 3:36:23| I feel like this is right, you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12985)|
| 3:36:27| You're not paying our debts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12987)|
| 3:36:29| You're not out there mowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12989)|
| 3:36:31| You're not keeping it up, and you're not crying your eyes out every time you leave that farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12991)|
| 3:36:35| because you know you're losing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12995)|
| 3:36:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=12999)|
| 3:36:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13002)|
| 3:36:48| I'd like to kind of go on what my sister had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13008)|
| 3:36:52| Our grandfather bought this farm back in 1958.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13012)|
| 3:36:55| There was one little old farmhouse, and the garage that sits in the field now, the white garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13015)|
| 3:37:03| it used to set up more level where the home is at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13023)|
| 3:37:07| And it was the general store for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13027)|
| 3:37:14| Bottom line is our grandfather bought this to pass it down to his family through generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13034)|
| 3:37:23| And it's not just my sister and I have inherited this farm, but we have cousins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13043)|
| 3:37:30| And I know you all don't want to hear my family history, but what a wonderful place our grandparents made for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13050)|
| 3:37:43| This is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13063)|
| 3:37:45| This is not easy at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13065)|
| 3:37:50| One of the points, you know, is as soon as probate was over, my grandfather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13070)|
| 3:37:57| when the commission rezoned this property, my grandfather, I don't know a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13077)|
| 3:38:08| I don't have eloquent words, as some people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13088)|
| 3:38:11| He fought that his land tax is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13091)|
| 3:38:15| When our parents inherited this farm, my parents didn't have the understanding on how to control this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13095)|
| 3:38:27| And so the taxes went up, and they went up, and they went up, and they went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13107)|
| 3:38:32| As soon as probate was over, for what my sister and I inherited, they jumped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13112)|
| 3:38:39| The funds that were available at one time are now gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13119)|
| 3:38:44| Our parents were very ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13124)|
| 3:38:47| The funds had to be there, and we had to take care of our parents to their health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13127)|
| 3:38:52| and to make sure that they were taken well care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13132)|
| 3:38:55| Now we're stuck with the fact that June, as of June 4th, I believe, June 3rd or June 4th, we'll no longer have the funds are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13135)|
| 3:39:06| We will be responsible for a piece of property that we cannot keep insurance on, the land taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13146)|
| 3:39:19| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13159)|
| 3:39:20| And this was the biggest part of the decision, that we sell the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13160)|
| 3:39:27| Now, it has been for sale for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13167)|
| 3:39:29| And with the zoning that you all have required or the commission has required, from the best I can understand it, no one showed any interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13169)|
| 3:39:41| No one has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13181)|
| 3:39:43| Mr. Davis went to our realtor that we had to do this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13183)|
| 3:39:51| And he has been willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13191)|
| 3:39:54| He's worked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13194)|
| 3:39:55| He's talked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13195)|
| 3:39:57| He's listened and he's heard our grief and our disappointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13197)|
| 3:40:02| I'd give anything to be able to do it, but I can't, and neither can my sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13202)|
| 3:40:07| And, Mr. Davis, from what I understand, it's gone to a few less homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13207)|
| 3:40:14| I don't completely understand what you're all talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13214)|
| 3:40:17| I wish I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13217)|
| 3:40:19| And he's willing to bring this down, from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13219)|
| 3:40:23| All I can ask is that you say yes to this, because otherwise we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13223)|
| 3:40:32| Thank you for listening to my sister and I and for helping us in any way that you possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13232)|
| 3:40:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13239)|
| 3:40:45| You know, we all don't take everything into consideration when we're looking at these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13245)|
| 3:40:48| but this is an inherited piece of property and this family needs to settle this estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13248)|
| 3:40:51| It's obviously a very emotional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13251)|
| 3:40:54| And I didn't hear any opposition to residential, which is we're asking basically for a down zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13254)|
| 3:41:01| We're not asking for ag to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13261)|
| 3:41:03| We're asking for from hospital to all these other things to single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13263)|
| 3:41:11| And I'm willing to compromise that down to three and a half units per acre if that helps satisfy the opposition here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13271)|
| 3:41:16| I respect the request that you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13276)|
| 3:41:18| One question, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13278)|
| 3:41:19| You and I, in our conversations previously, talked about the other house that's on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13279)|
| 3:41:26| Is it Jernigan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13286)|
| 3:41:27| Jernigan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| What's the status of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13290)|
| 3:41:32| I have never spoken to the Jernigans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| I don't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13294)|
| 3:41:35| I've been out there several times to try to meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13295)|
| 3:41:38| I do not know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13298)|
| 3:41:39| I've never introduced myself to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13299)|
| 3:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13300)|
| 3:41:41| So that's not part of the desired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13303)|
| 3:41:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13304)|
| 3:41:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13305)|
| 3:41:46| It's the one house in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13306)|
| 3:41:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13309)|
| 3:41:52| Dr. Briggs, I think Dr. Briggs' lot was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13312)|
| 3:41:56| I'll just make a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13316)|
| 3:41:58| I'm going to do the same thing I did on the last one is to ask the NPC about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13318)|
| 3:42:03| I'm looking here, and I believe there's a subdivision just down the road from there, Magnolia Point and Reagan Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13323)|
| 3:42:12| Just looking at this on the KGIS map, it looks like it's fairly dense housing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13332)|
| 3:42:18| I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13338)|
| 3:42:19| It looks like a typical subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13339)|
| 3:42:22| One of them is three and one of them is 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13345)|
| 3:42:26| So just right down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13346)|
| 3:42:27| It's on Coward Mills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13347)|
| 3:42:29| On Reagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13349)|
| 3:42:30| Coward Mill at Reagan is Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13350)|
| 3:42:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13352)|
| 3:42:33| Reagan comes off of Reagan Road, and the Magnolia Point is off of Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13353)|
| 3:42:40| So that answered my question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13360)|
| 3:42:41| But is the objection or when this discussion went about, is it that the NPC wants to retain this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13361)|
| 3:42:48| in the technological corridor, or was there another problem about the compromise, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13368)|
| 3:42:55| that Scott's come up with on having the density of the housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13375)|
| 3:43:01| The -- correct me, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| It wasn't or there wasn't a compromise discussed or lower density discussed at NPC, I think, at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13384)|
| 3:43:10| Let me just restate that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13390)|
| 3:43:12| Was the objection that NPC had related to the density of the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13392)|
| 3:43:17| or did they just not want to change this out of the technological overlay because you wanted to maintain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13397)|
| 3:43:25| in the technological overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13405)|
| 3:43:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| Well, I think the -- pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| The correct term is they wanted it to be maintained for BP uses, business and technology park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13411)|
| 3:43:36| The technology overlay will not go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| It will still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13418)|
| 3:43:40| It was NPC's view and based on staff review from the NPC staff that we need to maintain our inventory of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13420)|
| 3:43:51| that can be used for these kinds of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13431)|
| 3:43:54| Just down the road to the southwest as you approach Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13434)|
| 3:43:59| Karis Healthcare is undergoing a major expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13439)|
| 3:44:02| We'll be adding two buildings to that campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13442)|
| 3:44:05| They're adding some parking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13445)|
| 3:44:08| More gradually, property to the southeast is in Pellissippi Corporate Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13448)|
| 3:44:14| That continues to be an object of development, although it's been more gradual in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13454)|
| 3:44:20| There have been some heavy investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13460)|
| 3:44:22| And just to the northwest, you have Horseshoe Bend Business Park that has been somewhat developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13462)|
| 3:44:28| The last major expansion was a church, Faith Promise Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13468)|
| 3:44:33| They were able to get a new slip ramp off of Pellissippi Parkway to provide better access to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13473)|
| 3:44:41| It's just based on what staff felt like, the NPC staff felt like needed to be maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13481)|
| 3:44:47| as this inventory of BP's own property in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13487)|
| 3:44:52| Although it's not scheduled, it's not programmed at this point, we have discussed with the county extending possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13492)|
| 3:45:01| If you look at your zoning map that comes with the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13501)|
| 3:45:07| you can see Cherry Hollow Boulevard down there on the lower part of the map that's in Pellissippi Corporate Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13507)|
| 3:45:13| The idea is to extend that to the northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13513)|
| 3:45:17| and it would run essentially on the western boundary of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13517)|
| 3:45:22| That follows a proposal recommendation out of the Comprehensive Development Plan for the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13522)|
| 3:45:29| We try to establish a frontage road system or a parallel access road system on each side of the parkway with the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13529)|
| 3:45:37| that that's going to open up more land, make more land attractive for the BP-type uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13537)|
| 3:45:43| create some value for those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| That's not programmed, but we have gone as far as developing an outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13545)|
| 3:45:50| or a rough corridor alignment for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13550)|
| 3:45:55| And at some point in the future that may be programmed for implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13555)|
| 3:45:58| So those are the major reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13558)|
| 3:46:02| Another reason is if you and, you know, I'm not going to you know, there are some very obviously strong practical reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13562)|
| 3:46:16| to go through with this, and we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13576)|
| 3:46:18| If you do allow this to go to a low-density residential zone, with the experience we've had in other locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13578)|
| 3:46:26| it may prove very difficult to develop the remaining BP properties that border this site, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13586)|
| 3:46:33| if they come about and are developed and proposed for BP-type uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13593)|
| 3:46:38| Could I have a chance to respond to some of these, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13598)|
| 3:46:42| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13602)|
| 3:46:43| First, MPC was told by their attorney that they could not vote for it because it was a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13603)|
| 3:46:53| There was no opposition to, that I recall, from any of the MPC staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13613)|
| 3:46:58| They were told they could not change it because of the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13618)|
| 3:47:04| Second, and all due respect to Buzz, who I have a lot of respect for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13624)|
| 3:47:08| Horseshoe Bennett, who you referred to, guess who developed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13628)|
| 3:47:12| I did and John Murphy over 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13632)|
| 3:47:14| There's still vacant land in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13634)|
| 3:47:16| We were told over 15 years ago that there would be a parallel corridor road potentially going up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13636)|
| 3:47:22| I was told that 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13642)|
| 3:47:24| That hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13644)|
| 3:47:25| I don't expect it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| As it relates to developed land around this particular property, the land adjacent to this property is already developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13647)|
| 3:47:37| The land to the west and adjacent to this property is the detention pond for the already developed business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13657)|
| 3:47:46| The land to the east of this property is Mr. Johnson's property, which is eight acres that he just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13666)|
| 3:47:52| So the land around this property to interfere with future development of this property is a moot point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13672)|
| 3:47:57| because it's already developed and Mr. Johnson doesn't ever intend to sell his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13677)|
| 3:48:01| So you have a detention pond on one side, the business park on the other side, and Keller Mill Road on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13681)|
| 3:48:06| You have the one acre piece of property that's in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13686)|
| 3:48:09| That's the only, quote, undevelopable piece of property adjacent to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13689)|
| 3:48:14| MPC was told they couldn't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13694)|
| 3:48:17| All the land around it is already developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13697)|
| 3:48:21| And the road he's talking about going over to Horseshoe Bend was promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13701)|
| 3:48:24| or at least not promised but discussed over 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13704)|
| 3:48:33| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13713)|
| 3:48:34| I still have the floor open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13714)|
| 3:48:36| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13716)|
| 3:48:37| This is a little bit off on a tangent, but if land is zoned agricultural, you can put it in the green belt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13717)|
| 3:48:46| and it reduces your taxes eight or tenfold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13726)|
| 3:48:52| The land of this land is already zoned business and technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13732)|
| 3:48:57| That probably would not even be eligible to be put into a green belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13737)|
| 3:49:01| Does anyone know the answer to that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13741)|
| 3:49:04| I mean, because I can tell you the land out there has gotten very, very expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13744)|
| 3:49:08| and you basically can tax people right off their land if you can't get some sort of break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13748)|
| 3:49:13| Green belt does give you a break, but I don't think you can put business and technology into a green belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13753)|
| 3:49:22| I bet you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13762)|
| 3:49:23| Not to my knowledge, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13763)|
| 3:49:24| This is only an eight-acre plot, so it wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13764)|
| 3:49:27| It wouldn't be big enough anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13767)|
| 3:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13768)|
| 3:49:29| Question for Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13769)|
| 3:49:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| When we talked about it, he said it was denied because of a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13773)|
| 3:49:37| How come we don't have an appeal of the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13777)|
| 3:49:40| If he won this, if this appeal went to 3.5, would we not still need a sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13780)|
| 3:49:47| Yes, you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13787)|
| 3:49:51| Actually, I thought that was part of what we were applying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13791)|
| 3:49:55| When I appealed this, I made the assumption because it was denied by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13795)|
| 3:50:00| I obviously made a wrongful assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13800)|
| 3:50:02| I've already spent over $3,000 in fees and applications and appeals and a lot of time, energy and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13802)|
| 3:50:09| I wrongfully made the assumption when I make an appeal of something that was denied by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13809)|
| 3:50:13| I'm assuming I'm appealing what was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13813)|
| 3:50:17| Obviously, I was incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13817)|
| 3:50:19| Would he need two appeals or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| Would we need two items on our agenda for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13821)|
| 3:50:24| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13824)|
| 3:50:27| In the event that the planning commission doesn't adopt a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13827)|
| 3:50:31| the county commission can initiate a plan amendment of its own just as we did with the previous case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13831)|
| 3:50:40| So there is no appeal of the planning commission decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13840)|
| 3:50:46| Had they adopted the plan amendment, you would have voted to make it operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13846)|
| 3:50:51| Since they don't you don't have it in front of you, you have the option of initiating your own plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13851)|
| 3:50:57| if you want this particular piece of land to be considered for residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13857)|
| 3:51:02| So then it wouldn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13862)|
| 3:51:04| You're in the same exact situation you were with the previous appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13864)|
| 3:51:07| Let's do a scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13867)|
| 3:51:10| If it's denied, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13870)|
| 3:51:12| Or if the appeal is denied, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13872)|
| 3:51:13| But if the appeal is granted with the 3.5, we have to put a caveat in there that requests MPC to initiate a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13873)|
| 3:51:23| and you review it and vote on it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13883)|
| 3:51:27| You cannot act to approve residential zoning at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13887)|
| 3:51:33| because you don't have a land use plan that supports that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13893)|
| 3:51:36| So you would basically put the appeal on hold, initiate a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13896)|
| 3:51:42| receive the planning commission's recommendation, and then act on a plan amendment and the appeal at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13902)|
| 3:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13908)|
| 3:51:49| Now, can the average everyday person that walks off the street, I've dealt with 40 subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13909)|
| 3:51:54| I started this process in October going to TTCDA, MPC, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13914)|
| 3:51:59| And, you know, this is an incredibly laborious process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13919)|
| 3:52:02| But it's also incredibly stressful on the family because trying to explain this to someone who comes off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13922)|
| 3:52:10| it's really difficult and challenging to explain how our government has these processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13930)|
| 3:52:15| and these things we have to go through that are six, eight, ten months in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13935)|
| 3:52:20| I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13940)|
| 3:52:22| Commissioner, we would agree with everything you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13942)|
| 3:52:29| Thank you, state legislature, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13949)|
| 3:52:31| I want to get the minutes from this meeting so I can go to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13951)|
| 3:52:34| Commissioner Olney, we'll start here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13954)|
| 3:52:36| Yeah, I'm going to make a substitute motion, and it's not to delay this any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13956)|
| 3:52:42| But, I mean, it's going to delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13962)|
| 3:52:44| A substitute motion is to delay this for 30 days to give the family and Scott a chance to try to work out a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13964)|
| 3:52:56| before we rule and send it back to MPC or we vote it down, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13976)|
| 3:53:00| And that's the only reason I'm saying 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13980)|
| 3:53:03| Well, can I, Daniel, correct me if I'm wrong, but you'd have to initiate a plan amendment and then delay it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13983)|
| 3:53:10| initiate a plan amendment to get what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13990)|
| 3:53:12| and then have them meet while the plan amendment's going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13992)|
| 3:53:17| So we can't delay this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13997)|
| 3:53:18| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=13998)|
| 3:53:20| Well, you have to delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14000)|
| 3:53:21| There's no way we can vote on it tonight in an approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14001)|
| 3:53:25| But you have to initiate a sector plan change parallel to the community and Scott meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14005)|
| 3:53:34| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14014)|
| 3:53:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14016)|
| 3:53:41| Substitute motion that we initiated a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14021)|
| 3:53:48| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14028)|
| 3:53:51| So there's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14031)|
| 3:53:54| I'm even as confused as the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14034)|
| 3:53:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14036)|
| 3:53:58| Well, you're going to have to have more definition than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14038)|
| 3:54:02| At what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14042)|
| 3:54:04| Three-and-a-half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14044)|
| 3:54:05| Two-and-a-half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14045)|
| 3:54:06| Well, it would be PR, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14046)|
| 3:54:08| No, you simply designate it as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14048)|
| 3:54:13| That's the terminology used in the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14053)|
| 3:54:17| Then the zoning can be anything that's consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14057)|
| 3:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14061)|
| 3:54:22| Can we set that at what is LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14062)|
| 3:54:25| Is it one to three, one to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14065)|
| 3:54:26| One to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14066)|
| 3:54:27| But we can set it, though, one to three-and-a-half, one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14067)|
| 3:54:30| Later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14070)|
| 3:54:31| Yeah, you can set the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14071)|
| 3:54:32| Later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14072)|
| 3:54:33| Right, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14073)|
| 3:54:34| Because the official request would still be up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14074)|
| 3:54:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14077)|
| 3:54:38| If it came back to you guys whenever it comes back, then you have the leeway to recommend anything less than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14078)|
| 3:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14086)|
| 3:54:47| So to do the substitute motion, then, I don't need to give 3.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14087)|
| 3:54:51| Or would you just say low-density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14091)|
| 3:54:55| Create and initiate a sector plan amendment for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14095)|
| 3:55:02| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14102)|
| 3:55:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14104)|
| 3:55:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14107)|
| 3:55:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14109)|
| 3:55:10| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14110)|
| 3:55:11| Let's let them sit on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14111)|
| 3:55:14| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14114)|
| 3:55:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14115)|
| 3:55:17| Some of the questions that I had have been answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14117)|
| 3:55:19| but one that will weigh heavy with me in any direction that this may take is the 10-524, the Maxine Jarnagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14119)|
| 3:55:32| You brought it up just a second ago about the acre, more or less, that sits in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14132)|
| 3:55:40| This is going to be an odd, at best, looking development with that acre sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14140)|
| 3:55:47| So I noticed that on KGIS, the mailing address for the tax bill is the property address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14147)|
| 3:55:56| It's not being mailed somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14156)|
| 3:55:58| You said you had not seen anyone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14158)|
| 3:56:01| In addition to involving the community and the family and MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14161)|
| 3:56:08| and some other development here at a different density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14168)|
| 3:56:14| I would really strongly suggest you drag those people and their acre into this development somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14174)|
| 3:56:21| And I don't disagree with you, but, unfortunately, I can't force someone to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14181)|
| 3:56:25| And what I could do is potentially deed restrict that additional property that abuts Mr. Johnson's land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14185)|
| 3:56:33| because there's a piece of property kind of in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14193)|
| 3:56:36| and there's a 40-foot wide strip that comes across the back along the corporate center property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14196)|
| 3:56:41| and ties this property back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14201)|
| 3:56:43| I could look at deed restricting that property on what could and couldn't be done on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14203)|
| 3:56:49| But, unfortunately, I can't force someone to sell their property or do anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14209)|
| 3:56:53| And you can't put a road behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14213)|
| 3:56:55| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14215)|
| 3:56:56| You'd have to have two entrances if you bought or if you did something over here on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14216)|
| 3:57:01| Technically, the way it's set up, you could put a driveway there, but it wouldn't make sense to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14221)|
| 3:57:06| You're better off coming off of Calvert Mill Road with a couple of houses back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14226)|
| 3:57:10| But you wouldn't be able to connect, legally connect those two pieces, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14230)|
| 3:57:15| I mean, they're connected legally, but it wouldn't make sense to connect them via a county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14235)|
| 3:57:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14240)|
| 3:57:21| Commissioner Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| I wanted to just say to the family that is here, I hear your grief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14243)|
| 3:57:30| and it sounds like you have wonderful memories of growing up on that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14250)|
| 3:57:37| And I want to acknowledge the pain that all of this process has caused you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14257)|
| 3:57:43| And I know that taking this further is going to create another time delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14263)|
| 3:57:52| I'm interested, when I was hearing from the opposition, I wasn't hearing opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14272)|
| 3:58:00| just strict opposition to residential, but that perhaps up to 2.5 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14280)|
| 3:58:10| So, and I understand MPC staff's recommendation in this and do agree with it to an extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14290)|
| 3:58:22| So just looking at the totality of the situation, MPC staff, the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14302)|
| 3:58:30| the surrounding neighborhoods and their concerns, I would be inclined to support Jeff's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14310)|
| 3:58:40| But with the understanding that if the developer cannot work something out with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14320)|
| 3:58:48| in terms of density, you do not have my vote coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14328)|
| 3:58:54| I will not support anything above what the community says that they want, and I want to be very clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14334)|
| 3:59:01| I'm not okay with 3.5 or up to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14341)|
| 3:59:06| So you need to make your development fit with what these people want in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14346)|
| 3:59:14| So I want to be very, very clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14354)|
| 3:59:16| This does not say that I think that what you're doing is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14356)|
| 3:59:20| It's saying that I'm willing to consider it up to a certain limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14360)|
| 3:59:28| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14368)|
| 3:59:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14371)|
| 3:59:33| Just you'll probably be asked this when this comes back again, but just a quick poll of you residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14373)|
| 3:59:42| The polls that we got and the conversations that we've heard here today pretty much agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14382)|
| 3:59:50| that you could live with residential as long as it was within some kind of range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14390)|
| 3:59:59| As a show of hands, how many of you could live with three units to the acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14399)|
| 4:00:08| Two and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14408)|
| 4:00:10| There's a magic number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14410)|
| 4:00:16| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14416)|
| 4:00:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14418)|
| 4:00:19| I've been on commission now for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14419)|
| 4:00:21| And every time we get into these zonings, my head spins because it's like, okay, you can do this, but you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14421)|
| 4:00:26| And you've got to send this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14426)|
| 4:00:27| And you've got to, you know, and I understand, you know, the angst of everyone doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14427)|
| 4:00:31| I have a couple of questions, and I want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14431)|
| 4:00:33| First of all, in driving down Coward Mill, and I've driven down that road several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14433)|
| 4:00:37| but since I've moved across the river, I don't make that trek as often as I used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14437)|
| 4:00:41| But as you go down that road, it's very windy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14441)|
| 4:00:44| And then you have one lane bridge, and then you've got a railroad track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14444)|
| 4:00:47| and then you go on over to the Ben Atchley Nursing Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14447)|
| 4:00:51| Are there any plans that you would have, Scott, to improve the road entrances to that subdivision or the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14451)|
| 4:00:59| Or what would be your plan for the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| Because as I'm going around, as I saw the property, it's on a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14461)|
| 4:01:06| And so I'm just wondering about road improvements there that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14466)|
| 4:01:10| And that's obviously an engineering question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| but this property is less than a quarter of a mile or about a quarter of a mile from Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14472)|
| 4:01:17| And then if someone's leaving, and I'm not a traffic specialist or traffic engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14477)|
| 4:01:23| but if someone's leaving the subdivision, they're going to go left or right, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14483)|
| 4:01:27| If they go left, they're going to go straight to Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14487)|
| 4:01:29| which is about a quarter of a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14489)|
| 4:01:32| If they go right, they go to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14492)|
| 4:01:34| They would go down to Reagan Road and turn right long before you get to the narrow part you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14494)|
| 4:01:40| Or they would continue on down by the hospital, Veterans Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14500)|
| 4:01:44| and turn there, which is also before you get to the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14504)|
| 4:01:47| Or they have another option of going further down and turning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14507)|
| 4:01:50| I may be messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14510)|
| 4:01:52| I've got to mix it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14512)|
| 4:01:54| But they would get to Reagan Road before and turn to Hardin Valley or go Pellissippi that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14514)|
| 4:02:00| It would be, I'm making an assumption, that's where the most of the traffic would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14520)|
| 4:02:04| So bottom line is, is that you would build it and just kind of leave the road as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14524)|
| 4:02:09| except the entranceway, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14529)|
| 4:02:10| You'd have to improve the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14530)|
| 4:02:12| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14532)|
| 4:02:13| There's 18 feet of roadway right there at the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14533)|
| 4:02:15| and then it widens to 23 feet as you get closer to Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14535)|
| 4:02:23| As you come on Coward Mill on the left, there is a red building, commercial building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14543)|
| 4:02:29| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14549)|
| 4:02:30| Caris Health Care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14550)|
| 4:02:31| Caris Health Care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14551)|
| 4:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14552)|
| 4:02:33| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14553)|
| 4:02:34| It used to be an architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14554)|
| 4:02:35| And they're expanding, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14555)|
| 4:02:36| They're expanding, and they're going to add, you know, quite a bit more to what they're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14556)|
| 4:02:40| Now, across the road, there's some property there for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14560)|
| 4:02:43| Is it just a residential property for sale, or is there acreage to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14563)|
| 4:02:47| No, I used to own that property right there on the right-hand side of Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14567)|
| 4:02:50| That's an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14570)|
| 4:02:51| It's a small piece of property that backs up to the county development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14571)|
| 4:02:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14575)|
| 4:02:56| So as I understand my options, and I just like to think, you know, my mind is feeble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14576)|
| 4:03:00| and so I just like to just, you know, say, okay, here are my options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14580)|
| 4:03:03| Option A is that we can deny the appeal, and it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14583)|
| 4:03:08| I mean, it's over as far as we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14588)|
| 4:03:10| If we go with the substitute motion, then we are initiating another option for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14590)|
| 4:03:17| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14597)|
| 4:03:19| I mean, so basically that's kind of where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14599)|
| 4:03:22| In trying to read the room here, I don't see mean-spirited people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14602)|
| 4:03:27| I mean, I don't see the folks that are in opposition to it as mean-spirited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14607)|
| 4:03:31| I see them as wanting to protect their investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14611)|
| 4:03:33| They've put a lot of investment in their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14613)|
| 4:03:35| They are investing, you know, what their homes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14615)|
| 4:03:39| I look at the folks here who are wanting to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14619)|
| 4:03:42| They're wanting to protect their investment because they have invested years and, like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14622)|
| 4:03:47| more years and so forth in their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14627)|
| 4:03:48| So I see two sides that I don't see mean-spirited people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14628)|
| 4:03:52| Now, we've already had a compromise from 5 to 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14632)|
| 4:03:56| And I believe you said when you came in that you were surprised to see all the opposition here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14636)|
| 4:04:01| Did I hear that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14641)|
| 4:04:03| You're correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14643)|
| 4:04:04| So it seems to me that if you guys could get together and just kind of say, okay, here are the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14644)|
| 4:04:11| I know what the homeowners have said as to what they would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14651)|
| 4:04:15| If you could meet with them, if you were willing to do that during this process, I think that if you could come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14655)|
| 4:04:21| and both of you have come to an agreement, that's the best of both worlds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14661)|
| 4:04:25| Now, if you can't and we have to make a decision, then I'm prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14665)|
| 4:04:29| I mean, I've never passed on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14669)|
| 4:04:31| I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14671)|
| 4:04:32| But I would like to see you guys sit down and talk this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14672)|
| 4:04:36| And your substitute motion is going to do that because we can't take any action here except to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14676)|
| 4:04:41| And if we do, then it's all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14681)|
| 4:04:43| And I don't know that we really want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14683)|
| 4:04:44| I think we want to give you all an opportunity to see if you can work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14684)|
| 4:04:47| So that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14687)|
| 4:04:48| And this is what I would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14688)|
| 4:04:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14690)|
| 4:04:51| And I'm very willing to meet with the neighborhood associations and the folks in the area to discuss, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14691)|
| 4:04:55| how we can make this work for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14695)|
| 4:04:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14698)|
| 4:04:59| What we have, and I really want to kind of make a statement because I've tried to respond to every e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14699)|
| 4:05:04| I think I hit almost all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14704)|
| 4:05:07| And I told some folks in the audience that I talked to MPC this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14707)|
| 4:05:11| And so we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14711)|
| 4:05:12| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14712)|
| 4:05:13| I talked to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14713)|
| 4:05:14| And there's a couple of options that may not be as appealing as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14714)|
| 4:05:21| And so I'd like to, in those meetings that you all have, I'd like to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14721)|
| 4:05:25| and kind of discuss those because there's --because I've had discussions with the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14725)|
| 4:05:33| about extending Cherry Hollow, which would go across Coward Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14733)|
| 4:05:36| which would create a business intersection right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14736)|
| 4:05:41| And so those options need to be discussed with the community, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14741)|
| 4:05:44| And so we need to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14744)|
| 4:05:45| And so I would like to be a part of that meeting that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14745)|
| 4:05:48| And I think rural metro has a room we could have that in over at the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14748)|
| 4:05:52| And so we'll try to get that set up between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14752)|
| 4:05:56| But does everybody understand the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14756)|
| 4:05:58| The motion on the floor is to send the MPC, initiate a sector plan change to discuss the --for them to a low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14758)|
| 4:06:08| residential on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14768)|
| 4:06:11| That, in turn, would allow the residents and the developer and the property owners to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14771)|
| 4:06:16| So does everybody understand what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=14776)|
