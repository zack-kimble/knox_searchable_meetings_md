| 0:14:03| to be able to, you know, we're not going to have time to go through all of those recommendations that are in the in the printed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| portion of the plan. But we're going to we're going to highlight just a couple of those this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| So these are the areas that were part of the the inventory along streets and boulevards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| Some of the state route medians were were inventory central business improvement district and then some of the neighborhood boulevards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| You can see those on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| And then these are the parks where we went into the parks and within the manicured areas of the parks around the parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| buildings, pavilions and so forth. We created a map and inventory of all of these trees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| And then here are the areas that were part of the sample inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| We went in and selected 10 percent of the streets within each of these areas and collected data about the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=890)|
| 0:14:59| And then that data was fed into this model that I mentioned to you to determine the benefits that these trees provide the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=899)|
| 0:15:07| And that model is referred to as I tree streets. Seems like everything has an eye in front of it these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| But this I tree streets program allows us to basically calculate the monetary benefits the trees are providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=914)|
| 0:15:25| For many years, we were basically just, you know, all we could do is say, well, trees are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| They improve the quality of life. They make a city look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| But we really weren't able to measure in a monetary way what those benefits were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| And a lot of us as urban foresters realize that you as managers of a city or elected officials that direct the management of a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=941)|
| 0:15:51| you know, let's face it, a lot of it comes down to dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| There are many things that you'd like to be able to do for your city, but you need to know what those costs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| so that you can develop a good business plan on how to carry out those things that you want to do for your citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| So this I tree streets model allows you to look at these benefits that trees provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| and actually calculate monetary values associated with those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| Now, you know, a lot of these benefits that trees provide are well known throughout the urban forestry community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| and people that are involved with, you know, environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| But a lot of people don't realize that some of these benefits that trees provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| are things that are right there in front of them and they may not realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| You know, large trees add value to real estate, whether it's a residential home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| I think we all know that a house with a large tree in the front yard that's well maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| is going to sell for more than a house without, you know, some nice trees in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| But what a lot of people don't realize is that trees in these shopping districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| in these smaller shopping districts within your town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| can actually increase revenue for the people that run their businesses in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| Studies have found that people stay longer, they shop longer, they'll pay to park, as long as they have some shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| So a lot of these studies have been done to calculate a lot of these benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| Storm water is another area that a lot of people don't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| When it rains, these trees capture a lot of the moisture on the surface of their leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| And that moisture is evaporated back into the atmosphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| and it means it's not going to run into your storm water system that you build and maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| So without those trees, your storm water system would have to be larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| So again, we've developed systems and models where we can measure those benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| those cost savings, over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| This I-Tree Streets model takes all of this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| and throws it through this large computer model that was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| and starts to calculate these benefits in each of these categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| And here in Knoxville, if we look at storm water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| the storm water benefits just in the study area, just in those ten neighborhoods that we sampled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| the benefits from trees just in storm water savings was about $200,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1098)|
| 0:18:26| And if you look at that chart without getting into all the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| any time it rains, you get this peak discharge of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| You get a huge flow of water for a while right after the rain event, and then it tails off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| But you have to build your storm water system in order to carry that surge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| in order to carry that peak flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| So if you have a lot of trees, your peak flow is reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| And that's the difference between that red line and that blue line, with and without trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| And by having a lower peak discharge or peak flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| you can get by with a little bit smaller storm water system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| Significant savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Energy. You know, trees shade houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| A lot of people don't realize that as trees evaporate or give off moisture from their leaf surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| they actually cool the air around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Trees are like little mini air conditioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Each leaf is a little mini condenser, just like in your car or your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| And as that water evaporates, it cools the air around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Multiply that by billions of leaves and thousands of trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| and pretty soon you're talking some real money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Again, in the sample area, energy savings were calculated to be $73,000 per year that trees provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1175)|
| 0:19:45| In terms of aesthetic and economic benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| you know, I was talking about the shopping districts, the benefit to shopping districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| increased value of real estate and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| Again, in the sample areas, benefits in Knoxville, $311,000 per year from trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| So if we add all these benefits up in all these different categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| in the sample areas within Knoxville, we looked at $600,000 or over $600,000 in benefits per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| That was about $83 per year per tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Now, if we throw in the cost to manage those trees, we looked at the city's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| sat down with David and a lot of his staff, kind of tore apart their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| and looked at all of the different costs that are associated with having trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| What does it cost to plant them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| What does it cost to run all these high-lift trucks that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| What does it cost to staff all the people that do all the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| What does it cost to pick up all this brush when you have these storms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| and even without storms, all the brush pickup that you all do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| What do all of those costs add up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| And in this sample area, not citywide, but in this sample area, it was about $174,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1258)|
| 0:21:07| So what that tells us is that for every dollar that you spend on trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| planting, pruning, removing, managing, and so forth, you get $3.44 back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| That's a pretty good investment, especially in this economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Anything that's positive right now in terms of economics is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| So trees do indeed pay us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| And we now have some very sound research and very sound figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| that are backed up by extensive peer review so that you can tell your citizens that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| and I think it's very easy within this sample area that we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| I think it's very easy for you to be able to tell your citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| that in Knoxville, for every dollar that you're spending on trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| they're receiving $3.44 in benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| Now, I mention that to a lot of mayors in cities, and they say, well, where's the check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| And unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| These are benefits that you see through savings of other investments that you might have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| Now, as we went through and did this inventory throughout the other selected areas in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| we collected a lot of data about the species composition of your urban forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| the diameter distribution, the health, the overall condition, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| I don't think it's any surprise to know that dogwoods are by far the most populous tree species along your streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1351)|
| 0:22:39| About 10 percent of the total population are dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| You've got red maple, sugar maple, willow oak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| It's a good mix of species, a very good mix of species in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| Where's the red oak on that list? I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| I don't see red oak as a top ten species either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| Willow oak is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| I remember red oak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| These are on the streetscapes rather than in the yards themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Because in the yards, you see a lot of red oaks and white oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| This inventory was only on publicly owned right-of-way along main boulevards, thoroughfares, and so forth, not on private land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1392)|
| 0:23:24| As far as size class distribution, you can just kind of see real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| the majority of your trees are around 7 to 12 inches in diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| This is a pretty good distribution of sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| You want to have lots of small trees because not all of them are going to survive to become big trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| A lot of people think, oh, we want to have more big trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Well, the only way you're going to have big trees is by planting lots of small trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| This size class distribution is actually pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| That dip in the 1 to 3 and 4 to 6 shows that you could possibly be a little more aggressive in terms of planting new trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1435)|
| 0:24:04| But before we put the cart before the horse, so to speak, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| one of the things that we stress to cities is that before you start going crazy with tree planting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| you want to make sure that you can take care of and maintain the trees that you plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| You want to make a commitment to maintenance before you agree to start planting more trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| Overall condition rating of the trees, this was something that was a little surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| 63% of the trees were in fair condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| About 15% in good, and 17% or 18% in poor condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| Overall, the urban forest here, the public urban forest, could really be considered a fair condition rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1480)|
| 0:24:51| Fair to maybe even slightly poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Describe what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| What is fair condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Fair condition would be a tree that exhibits – and really, if you look at that tree on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| that's probably one that is right at the poor category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| It's a tree that has some broken limbs, might be in hazardous condition or have a high risk associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| Maybe it hasn't been pruned in years, so there's a lot of dead wood up in the tree waiting to fall down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| And based on my experience with a couple of storms that you all went through over the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| and you guys lived through it, and David and his folks had to deal with it firsthand as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| a lot of debris during these storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| And that's because a lot of these trees have a lot of dead wood in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| And that's where being a little more aggressive in terms of pruning, maintenance, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| with trees that have been planted, you could raise this overall condition rating of the trees in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| and not only make them healthier and look better, but they'd be safer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| And, Skip, you may mention, just Councilman Della Volpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| that the condition rating is completed through, you know, a standard assessment tool that the industry uses throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1559)|
| 0:26:08| So it's not, you know, tries to eliminate the subjective component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| This is a rating tool that assesses the health and condition of the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| And I think the overall assessment is we've got a population that we need to be thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| We need to really think in the next 10 to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| We need to do the right thing from a planning standpoint so that we don't continue to have fair, poor, critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| but we get more trees in that very good-to-good category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| Yeah, and by mentioning that the trees are fair or fair-to-poor, I don't mean to sound the alarms and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| oh, my gosh, you know, some major commitments need to be, you know, taken on and, you know, major changes need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1601)|
| 0:26:50| It's really not that unusual for a city to be right in the fair or fair-to-good or fair-to-poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| So, you know, very few cities are what we would call very good or excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| You know, parts of the city, a lot of cities that you go to and parts of this city are excellent, and they are very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| You know, there's a lot of areas that you go through where you can tell there's a large degree of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| You know, your central business district is a very critical part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| And you said that the tree in the picture is considered poor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| That would be poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Is that tree, does it look like that because of bad pruning practices, that particular tree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| It's hard to tell if that one, if something broke out of it and it re-grew, it may have been topped in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| You can see on the right-hand side there's three or four sprouts coming out, and on the left-hand side it looks like there's three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| If the tree had been topped in the past, it's possible that that may have, you know, created that sprouting and created that poor condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1663)|
| 0:27:52| If we had some of the, implemented some of the recommendations that you're recommending in your conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| we would have a different tree, a different looking tree here, and what would we have had to have done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| Let me jump in there, and I'll let Skip answer this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| I don't think you're going to see publicly owned trees by the city that are in poor condition because of pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| One of the issues we have right now is a lack of a systematic pruning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| So, yes, that is a recommendation, especially, and Sam or David or Skip could talk to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| You know, we plant a lot of trees, and if you can do the right pruning within the first few years of that tree's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1706)|
| 0:28:34| or at least where it's been located, you're going to do a lot for that tree to do well over its lifespan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| So planting the right tree and doing the right maintenance the first few years is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| and I'd say we're kind of average to less than average at doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| We get them in the ground, we water them, and then they just kind of do their own thing just because of limited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| But that's an area we know that we need to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| I was just curious. Where's our one excellent tree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| Now, realize that doesn't mean that there's one excellent tree in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| Realize that the whole inventory that we did was only a portion of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| So I can guarantee you that Knoxville has more than one tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| And you need to be very careful when you're talking to others about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| You don't want to say Knoxville only has one excellent tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| This is a sample. This is a sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| David, how many trees do we plant a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| We plant anywhere from three to four hundred trees a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| And the tree board has really done a good job of kind of pushing us away from quantity over quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| And, you know, I think they would tell you that we're still working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| We need to select the right tree at the nursery before it gets here, which we're not involved in that process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| We need to make sure that when the contractor plants it, it plants it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| And then the follow-up is we need to do the right maintenance, especially in the first three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| I'll let these guys, they're the experts, three to five years, two to five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| make sure that we're doing the right pruning and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| really to get it established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| And so I think a lot of the issues you're going to see with our trees are because we don't do that initial maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| I'll just be up front. This year, our contractor, we typically have about a, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| about an eight or nine percent mortality rate on our trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| We have a one-year warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| We lost 60 trees already from last year's plantings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| It's the most trees we've ever lost out of our 400-some-odd trees, which is pretty surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| I was talking to our arborist about it yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| So we need to figure out why we lost that many trees and what the issues were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| And, again, proper selection at the nursery, proper installation, we've got to get that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| We can do that right now with our existing resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| Proper maintenance in the future may require us to tweak some things we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| or ask for some capital money or outsource a little bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| And we'll need to work, obviously, with the next administration on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| I know you and I have talked about it, but, I mean, are we getting ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| or are we just staying even with the number of trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| I mean, I think we're always going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| We're losing some canopy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| I don't think we're staying ahead with our tree plantings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| If you tried to look at total trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| but we need to make sure that we get the right trees in the ground, do the proper maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Some of that we can do right now with existing resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Some of it may need some additional resources in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| I have a question, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| With the tree planting, do we do most of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Do we use our own people in-house for planting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| or do we contract it out mostly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| We contract out 99% of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| We really have a single tree crew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| and I think Skip will talk about this a little later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| and the tree board folks may mention this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| We have a crew that's tasked every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| one truck, five guys, and an arborist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| that are tasked every day with dealing mainly with work orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| tree calls that come in on dangerous trees, removals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| They do plant occasionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| but we spend about $40,000 a year on planting through a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| And then we've been very fortunate the last, and I think it's three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| we've obtained a Tennessee Agricultural Enhancement Program grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| that has allowed us to plant another $10,000 to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| The last couple of years it was $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| and this year it's in the $10,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| So that's gotten our planning budget up to anywhere from $50,000 to $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| One thing the tree board has talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| and I agree with, we're just trying to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| is maybe taking a few thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| and outsourcing it to a tree company, to a tree professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| to help us with both the selection at the nursery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| which can be time intensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| and with maybe doing some oversight of the actual tree plantings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| It's hard. We have a single arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| They're planting 300 or 400 trees all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| and he also has his crew he's got to manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| so it's hard for him to be there on every tree planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| But the tree professional, Sam can tell you, he's been in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| It's a lot easier to catch a tree at the nursery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| or to catch it during the planting as compared to what we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| We go out and look, oh, we've got a bad, poorly planted tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| and then the contractor has to remove that tree, get another tree in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| It could be better, and we've got the existing resources to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| So it's just tweaking our current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| I think David did a good job of kind of describing in a general way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| the state of where the city is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| The city, and it's not unlike, I would say, a majority of cities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| The city is in kind of a reaction mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| When a request from a resident comes in about a street tree, the city reacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| They go out, they inspect the tree, they determine the need for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| and then they go out and they address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| And that's a great way to do service because it addresses needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| that residents and citizens have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| But what it lacks is the ability for you to systematically or cyclically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| go out and address a portion of your city every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| so that at least once every seven years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| every tree has either been inspected or pruned throughout its life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| And that's kind of an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| For cities that have established urban forestry programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| they try to get on about a seven-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Now, that will mean, and I know the eyebrows are going to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| that will mean that there are times when a resident calls and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| I need my street tree pruned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Your urban forester or your arborist will go out, inspect that tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| and they may say, well, yeah, the tree does need a little bit of pruning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| but there's no risk here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| There really is no public safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| So we're going to put that on our cyclical program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| and we'll address that tree in two years or three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| when the cycle comes through your neighborhood the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| Now, that takes a lot of will as an elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| to be able to tell a resident that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| But what it does is it just tremendously increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| the efficiency of your program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Your costs per tree will actually go down over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| as you develop that type of system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Now, again, it's not uncommon for cities to basically have a reaction program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| But what happens with a reaction program over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| is these trees that people aren't calling about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| fall into a little bit of disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| And I think that's the situation that you're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| Now, it might mean a little bit more in terms of resources to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| but the big issue is that you just need to become smarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| And that's where having a full inventory of the trees in your city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| and having someone that's responsible for that inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| and the systematic maintenance of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| and scheduling work with the crews and making sure that it gets done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| that's where you move into a very efficient program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| And you're close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| You have people like David and some of the others that get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| And there are some cities that we work with where they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| So the challenge for you now is to be able to develop the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| so that you can move to that systematic program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| or that cyclical pruning program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| plant trees at amounts that are appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| so that you're replacing what you're cutting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| and maybe a few more just to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| Because like David said, they don't all survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| But putting your resources where they're going to do you the most good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| I compare our current system with trees to how we were 25 years ago with BRUSH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| BRUSH used to be a call-in system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| It was a demand response system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| We did away with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| We went to a scheduled system to where every two weeks you get a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| And there was a growing pain period with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| where the normal call-in folks that got service had to wait the two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| as compared to getting it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| And that's where we're at with trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| hoping to get into more of a cyclical program with proper maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| compared to that reactionary program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| And we can move on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| Have we thought about either enlisting neighborhood groups or Eagle Scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| or something to be our eyes and ears on trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| I mean, adopt a tree kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Is there any approach to expand the resources with, like, you know, gift resources for free time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| Yeah, we're jumping ahead a little bit, but I'll throw in here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| the communities that have been able to develop those programs, like, I love that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| I'd love to have more volunteer programs, volunteer planning to have scout troops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| I'd love to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| You know, I wake up every day, and I wish I could say I think about trees 90% of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| but I think about trees when issues come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| just because I don't have somebody in the office every day thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| You know, Chattanooga is a great example, and I know we always look at Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| but they have an excellent urban tree program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| They have a full-time forester that is very well connected with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| is supported by the administration and by the public works department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| and that individual has been able to do things like start and adopt a tree program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| where there's dollars that can come in, to start to work with foundations to get funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| to apply for grants, to really wake up every day thinking about trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| and thinking about education and working with the tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Right now, having that capacity is just a little challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| I'm more reactionary because I've got 50 other things I'm trying to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| but that idea would require a little bit of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| I know the tree board's got lots of great ideas, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| and there's times where we get bogged down with the inability to have resources to complete those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| But developing some type of an advocacy program like you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| whether it's scouts or whoever it is, you know, tree volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| Some cities have groups that they call tree keepers who basically do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| They provide some assistance in terms of inspections and assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| but I think the point David's trying to make is that even though volunteers are great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| their time is free, the program is not free because somebody has to administer that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2365)|
| 0:39:33| Sometimes that takes a little bit of time, but they're great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| They're a great way to get some of the lower-skilled activities taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| David, if I could backtrack just a little bit along the lines, I guess, of using community groups to kind of—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2382)|
| 0:39:49| Pull your mic closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Thomas, yeah, pull your mic closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| To inspect trees, the idea of using community groups to inspect trees, you mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| and I had a question on it about what the criteria were for whether a tree was fair or poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2397)|
| 0:40:05| You mentioned, I think, there might be some objective standards on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| You don't have to get too technical, but I would like to know how you evaluate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| And I don't think we'd ever get to a point where we have—I can't imagine us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| I'd look over here at Tom and the guys that do this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| I think you use volunteers for education, for planning, for PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| That's where you really use volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| I mean, we've got, obviously, a big group of volunteers here that push us every day to do trees better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| When it comes to assessing the health and risk factors with a tree, you really need a professional to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| You need a certified arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| And so Jeff McCarter is our city arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| He's a certified arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| And we do get requests at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| And I'll have Jeff look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| Sometimes I need Sam to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| And we've had our tree board folks or David Vandergriff come in and do that assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| Because you start to look at risk and liability once you've done that assessment on a public tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| And so I don't know if we'd use volunteers for that, but there are lots of opportunities to use volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| But, again, you've got to manage those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| And we're involved in lots of volunteer activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| like bazillion blooms through Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Boy Scout groups call us regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| We do the annual Arbor Day event where we have school kids come in and we do a poster contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| So we already do some activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| But to really grow that and to grow potential resources through maybe a tree foundation or additional grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| you know, it's just one of those things that we're a little bit locked down from a resource standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| to be able to grow too much with existing resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| Well, on the chart that we saw a little bit earlier, you had so many trees that were fair poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| Was that mainly a visual inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Well, I imagine it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| But is there other things that you use to kind of rate those trees in particular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| Yeah, I'll let Skip answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| He can get into the assessment standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| There are standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| The International Society of Arboriculture has standards for, you know, describing condition ratings of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| It depends on whether you're looking just for overall condition or whether you're doing a tree risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| You know, David's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| You don't want to use volunteers to do risk assessment unless you're doing what we call a level one assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| There's some new standards that just came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Level one standard says you basically walk down the street and you just look for the worst of the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| You know, and you can use volunteers for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| They look at one side of the tree and they're just looking for the obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| A level two, you know, requires certified arborist and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| But in terms of trying to decide, you know, excellent, good, fair, poor, you know, excellent would be a tree with no defects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| It's that tree that you see in the park that is just absolutely gorgeous and it has no structural issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| A good tree is a tree that, you know, maybe it has one portion of the canopy that's a little weak, you know, or maybe it has a structural issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2571)|
| 0:43:01| It comes up about 15, 20 feet off the ground and then it divides into two main stems instead of having one main central leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| That might be a good tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| A fair tree is a tree that begins to have some of these defects that we see in the photo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| whether it's from, you know, being broken or being pruned improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| The tree just starts to take on some real issues in terms of overall health and structural stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| And then you just kind of move on down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| But even though they are subjective, each of these categories is described fairly well in some of these standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2608)|
| 0:43:37| that are developed by the International Society of Arboriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| And that's where the more training that your assessors have, the more comfortable you can be with their assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| And all of the assessors that we used in this inventory and all of our inventories, they're all certified arborists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| Every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| So most of them have probably looked at 100,000 trees or more in their career of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| They don't last very long in this because we have them on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| They're inspecting trees every day, five, six days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| So after a few years, they burn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| We've got to get them in the office a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| But here are some other categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| You can look at 50% of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| We're in need of some type of pruning, large tree pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| About 20% of smaller trees needed some pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| The next category, the young tree training, that's the one that David was referring to when you plant a tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2673)|
| 0:44:41| and if you get out there in the first three to five years of that tree's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| and you do what we call some structural pruning, you can solve a lot of problems down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| You can spend all your money doing big tree pruning with big trucks and lots of crews and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| or you could spend your money pruning a lot more trees when they're younger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| and make them stronger and healthier when they're young so they grow into healthy trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| and you'll greatly reduce your long-term cost in tree management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| So about 20% of your trees are in that position as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| Let me just say that's an important slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| We don't have a program now that addresses what we just looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| large tree clean, small tree clean, young tree train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| I mean, that's an area where we have a real weakness from a cyclical maintenance standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| and having this assessment has really helped highlight what we're not doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| What we really do is respond to requests and trying to transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| I mean, we're not going to do all this in the next six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| but over the next five to ten years, how can we transition our program to a cyclical maintenance-based program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| away from a reactionary program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| And if you have somebody on staff whose job it is to make sure that these things are being taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| like I love David's phrase about having someone that wakes up every day and they're thinking about trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| I mean, that's a nice thing to shoot for, to have somebody on your staff that that's what they're thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| every day when they wake up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| They can take care of making sure that these newly planted trees are revisited three to five years after they're planted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| so they get that structural pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| They can see to it that one-seventh of the city is pruned every year in your cyclical pruning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| So it pays a lot of dividends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| This slide shows the impact that trees and utilities have in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| One of the big issues, of course, is that trees and overhead utilities share the same space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| They're both a lot of times right alongside of the street, and both provide very, very valuable services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| But I think you'd be hard-pressed to find somebody who would say, well, I'd rather not have the wires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2818)|
| 0:47:06| I'd rather have the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| I mean, we all love trees, but I like to be able to turn my microwave on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| I like to be able to watch my baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| So obviously these wires and utilities are critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| And in the past, there was a lot of head-butting about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| There was a lot of, you know, some very ugly words spoken between different groups about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| But more and more cities now are finding ways, through good communication, through better practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| that the trees and utilities can sometimes share the same space as long as the right tree is planted in the right spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| or a decision is made that in some areas, maybe trees don't even belong there, depending on the type of overhead utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| But if the right choices are made early, you really minimize a lot of these conflicts down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| and you reduce the cost of getting that electricity to the residents, and you greatly minimize the outages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2877)|
| 0:48:05| You know, for a lot of utilities, their biggest cost item is vegetation management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| So if they have a good program of getting in and keeping these limbs away from trees, you can reduce those outages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2891)|
| 0:48:19| Let me just throw in there, you know, something we can do right now to make that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| And our arborist, obviously, is well aware of that, Jeff McCarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| When he sites trees, we get requests all the time, all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| And, you know, we don't always plant the tree if there's a conflict or maybe a future conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| You know, one thing we can do right now, and I've talked with Ms. Hanna over at KUB and with my boss, Steve King, I believe, who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| is to have traffic engineering and have KUB review the sites prior to planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| And so that's something that doesn't require new resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| It requires an email and then some work on KUB's end and work on traffic engineering's end so that we don't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| plant a tree that's going to be a conflict later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| And so we're very conscious of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| You know, that's something we can do right now and will do that can hopefully minimize any future conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2940)|
| 0:49:08| The idea is to plant a tree that's going to provide benefits rather than planting a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| Again, part of the project was developing this hazard remediation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| Basically what we did is provided the city with a map and a list of all of the trees that were either high or severe risk throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2961)|
| 0:49:30| And they're going to address those over the next year and a half or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| I think there was a total of about 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| I can't remember the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Yeah, the 1.1% severe risk, we immediately have started to remove those trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| And those were essentially dead trees that had a real risk to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| So, and it wasn't a huge amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| I think it was in, I'd have to look at it, maybe the 30, 25 to 30 tree range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| And we've started to remove those immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| To address some of the more high risk trees, we may need to look at some, maybe a capital request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| which, you know, we'll vet through the process in the next budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| But we've started to address it, but we know we may need some additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| And these, the trees that are low to moderate risk, you know, a lot of times cities just make the decision to defer those or to just accept the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3015)|
| 0:50:24| You know, every tree is going to have some risk associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| And we've identified those risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| But, you know, there's a lot of things that the city does or that people do that have risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| But we choose to deal with that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| And the best way to deal with it is, obviously, first identify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| And then you find ways to mitigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| The Urban Forestry Management Plan, like we mentioned, has all these recommendations in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| There's a number of them in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| But I just wanted to highlight a couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| And we've kind of already covered a lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| One of the biggest items was just to place a high priority on developing a systematic tree maintenance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| You know, as David mentioned, right now you're on kind of an on-demand system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| Some of us call it, you know, putting out fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| And I always like to see cities get to a program where they're doing fire prevention, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3074)|
| 0:51:22| where you're addressing needs and issues associated with urban forestry before they become a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| And, you know, your urban forest looks better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| The city looks better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| The benefits are higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Residents are happier, and it works out much, much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| And over time, believe it or not, it actually lowers the overall cost of tree maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| because a majority of your time is going to be spent doing that young tree training or young tree pruning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3104)|
| 0:51:52| rather than, you know, having the need for all this big equipment dealing with big trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3112)|
| 0:52:02| The other item was creating this new staff position, this urban forester position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| You know, this position would be the person who would oversee the inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| develop goals and, you know, long-term goals for the urban forestry program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3132)|
| 0:52:20| develop work orders so that, you know, the city was divided up into regions or zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| and one-seventh of the city is taken care of each year in terms of pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| They keep track of the overall planting program to make sure that you're planting more than you're removing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| You know, somebody with a high level of technical skill, computer skills, and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| that not only knows trees but also knows GIS and computer skills and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| that can kind of keep track of the whole tree program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| And with that, we have other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Yeah, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Do any of the cities that you looked at sort of have a little tree farm where they start seedlings or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3179)|
| 0:53:06| so that they have a stock or an inventory that they can plant maybe of desirable species, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| There are a lot of cities that will develop their own nursery and grow trees for use on public lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| But I'll tell you that the majority of them that do that, they're growing what we call park-grade trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| They're trees that are probably best used in less manicured-type settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| I don't know that you'd want to grow your own trees and use them as street trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| There's a lot of work that goes into that, a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Cities do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| We were in the nursery business probably back when I was in middle school or intermediate school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| And we got out of that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| I don't think we were very efficient at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| And I'm not sure if Tom Simpson or David, I think they would probably shake their heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| and say the city doesn't need to be in the business of growing trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| Now, maybe a volunteer program where you could do some seedlings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| But seedlings are usually, little whips are usually pretty readily available if you want to get those donated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| So good point, but I don't know if that's our skill set right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| What about the state seems to have programs through USDA or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| where they have these bare root trees in winter that are available for plantings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Have we looked into any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| We work, and we're really fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Tom Simpson is here local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| He's on the tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| And he, I mean, honestly, all these grants that we've received in the last four to five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| are really the result of Tom and David saying, man, apply for this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| And I'll let Tom step up here in just a second, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| We've got some good news on potentially where the state of Tennessee is going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| because of the efforts here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Our programs are going to kind of move up a notch, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| when the feds reassess what the state's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| But I don't know if it would behoove the city to get into the nursery business right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| No, I was thinking that might be a better resource if you have the Department of Ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| or the state that's making these trees available for urban reforestation or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| Yeah, and I think one of the things that the Ag Extension folks work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| folks like David Vandergriff, is to make sure that the folks who are growing trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| understand, you know, the standards and what a quality tree is and the benefits of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| And they know more about it than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| But states like Georgia have actually, you know, really had some statewide standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| that have made a big difference in the overall products that get produced at the nurseries in those states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| And that's kind of more at a state level issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| Now, obviously, if we had a professional on board that could be involved in some of that at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| This guy that wakes up every day and thinks about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| Yeah, you know, I'm there 5% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| But, you know, having somebody every day wake up, that urban forestry professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| And, again, Jeff McCorder, our arborist, is a professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| But Jeff has a crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Jeff's a crew leader, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| So, you know, having Jeff have the time to be able to go to that next level is pretty challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| But we work with the state regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| And I did real quick want to introduce Ms. Faulkner walked in and Kim Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Everybody knows Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| I can't brag on Terri enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| She has done more to get trees planted in Knoxville than I probably, I don't know, maybe Bob Santori is a little bit ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3381)|
| 0:56:30| But Bob Santori, Terri Faulkner have done so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| I just can't say how wonderful it is to work with Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| And then Kim Davis was the previous board chair for the tree board and has been very involved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| I don't know if anybody else walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| So we're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| That's the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| We're open to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| I think, in summary, trees have real tangible value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| They bring absolute return on investment for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| We've got to think long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| We've got to be strategic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Because when a big tree goes down, and we've lost a lot of big trees with our storms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| and you can literally, that looks totally different over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| There's some places on Kingston Pike now that just have a totally different look to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| And so we need to think long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| We also need to realize we're not doing everything perfect, and we're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| We're not trying to fluff this up to say we have a perfect program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| We've got a C, C-plus program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| We want to get to a B-plus, you know, B, B-plus program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| There's some ways we can do that with existing resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| There's some things that may need some resources in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| and we're trying to tee ourselves up for the next five to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| So I think this is a good time, and we're going to have new administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| and new council folks, and it's a good time to look at what we've done well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| and then look at some things we can improve upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| I've got a question for Skip, if I could ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| I was just going to call on you if you wanted to talk again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Skip, the chart that had the common species there, the most common one was Cornus floridae,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3472)|
| 0:58:01| the regular dogwood, but we've got terrible anthracnose and leaf wilt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| or whatever the second term is, two separate diseases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| and there are more resistant varieties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Are we pushing towards the more durable trees so we don't have semi-dead ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| five or ten years down the pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Well, one of the things that we promote as much as we can in the urban forestry world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| is trying to use native trees as much as you can because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| they've passed the test of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| They've grown here for eons, and, you know, they were meant to grow here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| But a lot of new diseases, you know, exotic insects and introduced, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| invasive pests and so forth have created a lot of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| and this dogwood anthracnose is a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| And, you know, if it's an issue on enough of your dogwoods that you're losing enough of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| you may want to look at some of the other cultivars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| or some of the other species of dogwood to still get that dogwood look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| But, boy, what a shame that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| You know, again, try to use the natives as much as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| but look for alternatives as these exotic pests move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| Well, it's not Cornus noxvillae, it's Cornus floridae.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I just didn't know what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| You wouldn't know that driving through Knoxville, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Probably the biggest effort on dogwoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| and something that David Vandergriff and I and others have been very involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| is the Basilian Blooms Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| which has been an initiative through Dogwood Arts Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| and Lisa Duncan, the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| And they are pushing for disease-resistant species of dogwoods, cultivars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| And so I think there's a presence of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| We've tried to back off a little bit on our dogwood plantings right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| because they've been so aggressive in kind of handling that niche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| I skipped in and say this, but typically you don't want more than about 10% of a single species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| So we need to continue to manage and plant dogwoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| and Basilian Blooms has really taken off on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| which allows us to maybe focus on some of those other species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| If we're a C+, what is Chattanooga?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| A B+.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Tom Simpson says an A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| How is Chattanooga able to build the kind of legitimacy around their effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| I don't mind if Tom wants to come up because he's very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| I would say Chattanooga has an absolutely fabulous city forester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| who is involved every day, that has respect of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| So the legislators just had to buy in and say this is important to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| because the public is always going to maybe feel like you're selling stained-glass windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| Yeah, and I'll tell you what, maybe just because I'm in the business every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| I've found most people in Knoxville are very, very involved with what happens to trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| So they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| They get it, they want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Now, obviously you're always going to have naysayers about where we allocate resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| but as we look at our budget every year and I look at people retiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| are there ways to reallocate and get some dollars to hire somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| Joe Walsh and I have talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Joe, obviously, as the Parks Director, has a need and a desire for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| So there may be a way with existing resources to get that person on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| But the reason Chattanooga is so successful in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| is because they have somebody that wakes up every day focused on trees, resources, management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| and not at the field level, at the administrative level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| And that is why they're ñ and they also have a really good person in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Mr. Bryce, do you want to call him to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| Tom or David, would you like to just comment about Chattanooga's program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| And I'd love, Tom, for you to talk about where the feds are with assessing the state, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| One of the things that has enabled Chattanooga to move forward like they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| the tree inventory and management plan that we just got, they did one 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| They've had information to work with for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| We as the tree board, one of the most ñ this has been the most exciting thing that's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| because we've never had real quantified data to look at and to work with to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| Now we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| We've got to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Now, with that said, I've been in the urban forestry realm for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| If you have this sort of plan done and everybody hears about it and says, yeah, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| and it gets put on the shelf and not used, which happens a lot, it doesn't do you a bit of good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| We have to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| And it's something the tree board's very dedicated to doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| David's very dedicated to doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| And we need you all to stand behind us to move that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| This is a start that we need to keep adding to, and then we can be where Chattanooga is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| But keep in mind, this is our first, and they made this move way before we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3770)|
| 1:02:57| Yeah, I'll agree with Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| If this plan gets put on a shelf and we don't utilize it, you need to take me to task in a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| because that's my job to make sure we do everything we can with our existing resources to maximize this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| and then hopefully we can find some other resources to go to that next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| I mean, we can get from a C to a C plus to a B just by doing some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| in how we do maintenance and mulching and watering and selection at nurseries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| and that's all current resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| So we're focused on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| If a couple of years from now we've not implemented some of these things, then, you know, that's on my shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| or whoever's in the public service department position I'm in to make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| David, I would say you recall, I guess it was probably about nine months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| that you and I talked about resources for trees and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| And I think my council colleagues know how I feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| But I would really encourage you to really go forward in terms of what it's going to take to have an urban forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| I think we also need to look at what it's going to take to really begin to replace what trees that are missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| And, as you know, I fully support whatever we can do to increase what trees we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| and really make people understand the value of a tree to the public and to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| It's not just a thing to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| But, I mean, think of all the health reasons that we have trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| Think of what they can do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| I think the time is kind of right for you folks to move forward to say, hey, we do need an urban forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| Or, hey, we do need, you know, instead of $40,000 a year, we ought to have $200,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| You know, if, in fact, you can deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| But I think the mood is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| And I certainly would push it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| This is one thing that is of most interest to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| So I would encourage you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| We'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| We'll move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| It was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| I was sitting here jotting down some other things that trees affect that are neighborhood-related programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| You know, trees are part of traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Trees are part of, you know, pedestrian notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Why is Market Square such a great place to have lunch and to relax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| The tree board saved the Sawtooth Oaks when that project went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| Those Sawtooth Oaks, the big six trees, really make that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| You know, blighted properties are a big issue right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| We're looking at programs like a side yard program or a greening program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| where maybe you've got a blighted property that we know is never going to be developed and there's no true owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| Maybe we get it on a mowing schedule and plant five or six great trees on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| knowing that instead of mowing it, we're just going to make this beautiful green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| Obviously, Mr. King, my boss, and I deal with stormwater on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| Trees are important for stormwater and will be more so, I'm sure, in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| So, you know, trees aren't just the tangible value for real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| They look great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| They really affect everything from engineering to stormwater, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| Are there any other questions from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Generally, I would like to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| Could you pull down your microphone, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| I've got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| This feels real informal in here because it's a small group and I forget the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Anyway, David, if you could just address generally what it seems to me like in Knoxville we've got –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| you know, you've got the city right away and you have trees where the city basically has jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| But then you've also got the utility board who trims for the power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| Just generally, could you address how we would work that out between who basically is making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3977)|
| 1:06:25| about what to do with the trees in particular instances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| Yeah, I'd say we have a great relationship with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| You know, Liz, who's here, I think she raised her hand earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| Liz is obviously very respectful of the trees that are on city property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| And any time they have a tree that they feel like needs to be pruned within a city park or along a city right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| we get contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| We look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| We try to make a decision collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Oftentimes we'll agree there is a conflict and we will give permission to KUB to do the pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| That happens fairly rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I think we've done a pretty good job of planting trees in the right locations really since, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| former Mayor Ash, Ambassador Ash was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| Our tree program went –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| we kind of made the first big step with Mayor Ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| And, you know, we became a – we got a tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| We got the Tree City USA designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| We had a formal planning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| We got a certified arborist on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| So we made some good strides then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| So I don't know if Ms. Hannah wants to comment on that, but they call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| They let us know about conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| Jeff McCarter or I or both of us go out and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| You know, a real – I know a real visible one were the maple trees that got planted near the YMCA in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4055)|
| 1:07:44| And those were legitimately – they really needed to be planted back another 10 or 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| And, you know, I noticed one – I live, obviously, on an island home near South Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| There's a park there on South Haven Road where we planted some maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| And, you know, it looked great when we planted them five, six years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| but I know there are going to be a conflict in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| We, the city, Jeff and I, made a mistake on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| They should have been planted back another 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| So we do our best, and we've got a good relationship with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| and we've not had any major conflicts to date on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4093)|
| 1:08:21| If there are no other questions from Council, we'll – we typically, if everyone acquiesces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| involve ourselves in public forums, so with Council's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| Is there anyone who came to address Council regarding the topic at hand tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| All right. If not, and there are no further questions, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| Thanks for a very informative presentation, very comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4122)|
| 1:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111027?start=4140)|
