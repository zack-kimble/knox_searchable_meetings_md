|  528.02 |  531.02 | so there's been two meetings with regard to this.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=528.02)             |
|  531.02 |  538.02 | And at the last meeting, the beer board suspended the license pending a hearing                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=531.02)             |

|  552.02 |  557.02 | I did have an opportunity to discuss the matter with the representative from                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=552.02)             |

|  573.02 |  577.02 | I do have the representatives of the bar here and I do apologize.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=573.02)             |
|  577.02 |  580.02 | I was actually asking them a question during the period of time that you were                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=577.02)             |

|  617.02 |  621.02 | They have maintained their ability to sell alcohol with the ABC permit                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=617.02)             |
|  621.02 |  622.02 | through the state.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=621.02)             |
|  622.02 |  624.02 | So I think if we'd had issues,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=622.02)             |
|  624.02 |  628.02 | we would have seen them particularly with regards to things that would be                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=624.02)             |
|  629.02 |  632.02 | troubling and that would be obviously something that is the death nail,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=629.02)             |
|  632.02 |  634.02 | would have been underage sales, things of that nature.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=632.02)             |
|  634.02 |  637.02 | So that being said, at least from a report standpoint,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=634.02)             |
|  637.02 |  641.02 | I think we're as good, albeit we're aspiring to be better,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=637.02)             |
|  641.02 |  643.02 | sort of like the Sears, good, better, and best.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=641.02)             |
|  643.02 |  646.02 | So obviously we can always do better,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=643.02)             |
|  646.02 |  650.02 | but I think the lack of citation speaks volumes is the fact that this                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=646.02)             |

| 2452.96 | 2462.16 | Point of clarification. So if they vote no, what is then what happens? We go back to a                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2452.96)            |
| 2462.16 | 2469.08 | 30-day revocation? I'll confer with our law director at that point. Well, could we find                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2462.1600000000003) |

| 2480.28 | 2486.68 | Law Director? The rules allow somebody that's got an offense that you found has been a first                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2480.2799999999997) |
| 2486.68 | 2505.4  | offense. Oh. The rules provide that on a first offense, it's a 30-day suspension, but the owner                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2486.68)            |
| 2505.4  | 2513.8  | or the applicant has a right to take a $1,000 fine in that person's discretion. You got to do                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2505.3999999999996) |
| 2513.8  | 2523    | one or the other. I mean, and you made a motion for the $1,000 fine, and even if that's defeated,               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2513.8)             |
| 2523    | 2527.4  | then you got to vote on giving a 30-day suspension, but then she's got the option in her                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2523.0)             |
| 2527.4  | 2540.52 | discretion to pay the $1,000 fine. So that's where you're at. So in other words, we don't have                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2527.4)             |

| 2553.24 | 2565.16 | Does that clarify it for you, Commissioner Schoonmaker? Correct. In other words, a no vote doesn't do anything. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2553.24)            |
| 2566.04 | 2569.96 | Thank you, Madam Chair. I'll remove my no vote, but I've got a problem with                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2566.04)            |

| 2592.12 | 2598.6  | So that's where my no came from. I mean, if it doesn't matter one way or another, but I mean,                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2592.12)            |

| 2612.2  | 2618.12 | but I think your rules from what I've seen in the last 17 years need to be re-evaluated,                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2612.2)             |

| 2638.2  | 2643.48 | Commissioner Daley? Yep. You have not called for the vote. You have not declared the vote,                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2638.2)             |
| 2643.48 | 2648.44 | correct? Correct. So I would suggest that you ask the no votes. If they would like to                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2643.48)            |
| 2648.44 | 2655.24 | change it to the yes vote, so the $1,000 fine can be paid. I had asked for a roll call vote.                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2648.44)            |
| 2655.24 | 2660.12 | So we'll go back to roll. Commissioner Jay? I just wanted some clarification for the law                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-beer-board?start=2655.2400000000002) |
