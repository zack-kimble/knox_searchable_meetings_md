| 2:40:41| So I've got to be clear that I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| And that is that we want to, I would like to have a resolution from this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9643)|
| 2:40:55| And I think that we had asked Dr. Norton to take a look at how the resolution can be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9655)|
| 2:41:05| So I think that we would want to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9665)|
| 2:41:09| And it could be now, therefore, let it be further resolved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9669)|
| 2:41:14| I like the last statement that we already have is not limited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| So that we do these things that Dr. Norton says, but not limited to, or to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9678)|
| 2:41:26| Some statement like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| So we leave it open for all the other things that's not suggested there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| but you still have some specific things suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| And I do want to add from a District 1 perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9697)|
| 2:41:42| I think we talked about 60% of the district, the whole district students may be in this retention area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9702)|
| 2:41:51| And I think for District 1, the percentage would be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| So this is something that I think one of the reasons why we have our regions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9715)|
| 2:42:00| and looking at the way that our feeder schools work, that we're looking at it for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9720)|
| 2:42:07| so we can look more specifically at the needs of every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9727)|
| 2:42:11| So this fits what we have designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| So I think it's important that we say that and be as specific as possible, but also broad enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9735)|
| 2:42:22| And so I think adding a now, therefore, further resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| My question is, can we do that and be prepared for that on Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9747)|
| 2:42:37| Ms. Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| Well, first, I want to thank Dr. Norton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| I think I got ahead of myself and forgot to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| I really, really appreciate all of your work and how great this looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9764)|
| 2:42:50| And I think I agree with everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| And I think that's where I got a little caught up in or hung up in trying to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9773)|
| 2:42:59| because I would like to have something that was attached to this, but I don't want it to be too specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9779)|
| 2:43:05| Or, you know, I don't want to tell someone how to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9785)|
| 2:43:08| I don't want to say, like, exactly, this is how you should write this law, and this is how all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9788)|
| 2:43:14| But I do want to say, here is a suggestion of what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9794)|
| 2:43:18| And I don't really know what that should look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9798)|
| 2:43:22| but I would like to have something ready that we could vote on on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9802)|
| 2:43:27| Do you have any suggestions of any way to piecemeal something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9807)|
| 2:43:34| Would you like me to try to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9814)|
| 2:43:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| I'll take what you said, which was, now let it be further resolved to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| and then take Dr. Norton's language and slide it in there, and then I'll send it to Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9824)|
| 2:43:51| But I can say such as, so that it's open, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| Or to include, or not limited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| Not limited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| So that there's suggestions on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| I'm an English teacher, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| Mr. Dupour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| Well, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9847)|
| 2:44:08| It sounds like it's coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9848)|
| 2:44:09| But, Dr. Norton, is there parts of what you wrote that you feel like, I mean, I guess what I'm asking is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9849)|
| 2:44:17| we probably need to collaborate with you directly to make sure that there's parts that need to go in, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9857)|
| 2:44:24| and maybe other parts that need to stay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| I think in terms of the resolution landing on the desire for local control of the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9868)|
| 2:44:35| the piece that they've pulled out with the seven points around what is currently in the retention policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9875)|
| 2:44:41| around what data would be used for making that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| is probably the most relevant piece to pull in to the resolution itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9884)|
| 2:44:48| And then possibly considering the other components as part of legislative priorities makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9888)|
| 2:44:58| So do we have a plan, does it sound like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| Ms. Owen, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9904)|
| 2:45:05| We have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9905)|
| 2:45:06| You have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9906)|
| 2:45:09| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| So any other comments or questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9913)|
| 2:45:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| So moving on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9924)|
| 2:45:30| Yes, we have several people signed up this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| First is Annabelle Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| You can state your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9937)|
| 2:45:43| Thank you, Annabelle Henley, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| I had a three-minute thing to tell you how excited I was about the possibility of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| but now I just want to say, great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| You all were an amazing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| You worked together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9955)|
| 2:45:56| You came up with a great thing, and so good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9956)|
| 2:46:03| Next up, Marty Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9967)|
| 2:46:08| State your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9970)|
| 2:46:11| My name is Marty Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9971)|
| 2:46:12| I am a special educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9972)|
| 2:46:16| I used to work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| I've been independent for 28 years working with students with dyslexia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9979)|
| 2:46:25| One-on-one and have a couple of people working with me and recently started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| well, this will be our fifth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| It's not that recent, a council, Knox County Council Dyslexia Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9993)|
| 2:46:41| That includes, it's not run by any one group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10001)|
| 2:46:46| It includes people from the UT teacher preparation programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10006)|
| 2:46:54| and several people that are administrators in Knox County and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10014)|
| 2:47:02| and academic therapists like myself and organizations, representative from organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10022)|
| 2:47:13| And we've met several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10033)|
| 2:47:18| We meet quarterly to communicate the best way to work for individuals with dyslexia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10038)|
| 2:47:31| So our response to this law, which I can't understand to begin with where it came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10051)|
| 2:47:41| and why, I mean, I know it came from the state, but I don't know why it was approved to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10061)|
| 2:47:49| But we did find in the state frequently asked questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10069)|
| 2:48:03| and I think you were the one, Ms. Horn, that added that to the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10083)|
| 2:48:11| that students with learning disabilities wouldn't be able to be held back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10091)|
| 2:48:24| if that had anything to do with their doing bad on the TCAPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10104)|
| 2:48:31| So anyway, it's in the Knox County policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10111)|
| 2:48:37| It's not in the state policy, but it's in their frequently asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10117)|
| 2:48:42| It's number 11 under special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| So you have to really look for it, which means parents aren't going to know it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| Many teachers aren't going to know it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| And it also says suspected disabilities, if those disabilities would cause a low grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10132)|
| 2:49:00| I think this resolution is mainly asking them to give permission to our Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10140)|
| 2:49:08| to make those decisions on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| So that in itself was in the resolution as far as time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10151)|
| 2:49:26| Thank you for coming out. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10166)|
| 2:49:29| Okay, thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| Candace Bannister, you know the rules already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10172)|
| 2:49:36| Candace Bannister, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| First let me say thank you so much for working so well together tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10179)|
| 2:49:43| playing well with friends, and coming up with a really good plan for getting this done on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10183)|
| 2:49:49| We've covered one part of one test cannot possibly be used to make such a huge decision in the life of a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10189)|
| 2:49:56| I appreciate that our board does support parental input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10196)|
| 2:49:59| and I think most of you are parents and that gives you the impetus to want to have a say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10199)|
| 2:50:04| in whether or not somebody else halfway across the state makes a decision for your child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10204)|
| 2:50:09| So I appreciate that you have that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| You asked about why, why would they maybe do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| In talking with several legislatures with our coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10214)|
| 2:50:19| the first thing that we always hear is we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10219)|
| 2:50:22| Only 40% of our children can read in third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| See, that's what they hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10225)|
| 2:50:26| They're told that 41% of our children are proficient in reading or on grade level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10226)|
| 2:50:31| but what they hear is only 40% of our children can read, and that is absolutely not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10231)|
| 2:50:35| I'm a second grade teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| I did it for 25 years, that in third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| We sit down with our children every day and hear them read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10239)|
| 2:50:42| Every week we do a reading, or I did, did a reading with them, a one-minute read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10242)|
| 2:50:46| to see how many words they read per minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| It might range from somewhere 22 words per minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| which are your low readers in the beginning of second grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| all the way up to children that read over 200 words per minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| But they are reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10257)|
| 2:50:58| It's not that we have non-readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| We just need to find a better way to be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10260)|
| 2:51:03| I think Dr. Reiswick said it best when he said if retention were an effective intervention, we would be using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10263)|
| 2:51:11| We're not using it here in Knox County because it is not effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| Across the state, generally only 2% of our children are retained, and we need to leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10275)|
| 2:51:22| We don't need somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10282)|
| 2:51:23| And the thing is, our legislators are not educators for the most part, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| You all have access to the best educators and experts in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10288)|
| 2:51:34| and none of them are telling you this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10294)|
| 2:51:37| So I would appreciate it if you all come together on Wednesday and let's get this thing done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10297)|
| 2:51:42| and send it out there and let them know that, you know, it's not the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| I think they do feel the need to do something because they want their state to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| They want our kids to do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| We love the volunteer state, but they didn't get it quite right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| So sometimes you have to tell people exactly what you feel is best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10316)|
| 2:52:01| and they may not take every word that you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| but they may at least hear the message that there need to be some revisions so that we have the local control here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10323)|
| 2:52:10| I did have to retain that child one time I told you about last time without parental support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10330)|
| 2:52:16| and it didn't help that child because that parent didn't support that retention, and it was out of my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10336)|
| 2:52:20| We have to have parental support for something like this to matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10340)|
| 2:52:23| and I just appreciate that you all take that to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| So thank you for advocating for our students, and I can't wait to see this done on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10346)|
| 2:52:31| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10351)|
| 2:52:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| Ms. Paula, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10354)|
| 2:52:42| I appreciate you all so much, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| Thank you for giving me an opportunity to at least share my passion because I am going to speak on this a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10364)|
| 2:52:49| and I do appreciate what Board Member Owens stated about let's get the professionals involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10369)|
| 2:52:57| Paula Hancock, Knox County, speaking as an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10377)|
| 2:53:01| the third grade retention law or what we call TCA 49-6-3115 that has been put forth in its current form is oppressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10381)|
| 2:53:11| and rooted in negative consequences resulting from the measure of a single data point based upon high-stakes testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10391)|
| 2:53:19| As it stands, it humiliates and denigrates our third graders by retaining them instead of putting forth assessment strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10399)|
| 2:53:26| and systems to propel them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10406)|
| 2:53:29| We, the adults, leaders in education, and educators should have the freedom locally to be able to utilize multiple sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10409)|
| 2:53:39| and kinds of evidence of students' learning to contribute to decisions on student promotion, retention, and course grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10419)|
| 2:53:47| We should be able to and have the freedom locally to decouple federally mandated statewide student assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10427)|
| 2:53:56| from high-stakes consequences for students, schools, and educators to help ensure that no measure should be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10436)|
| 2:54:04| to determine a student's performance or access to supports and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10444)|
| 2:54:09| I believe as an educator for over 25 years that we must employ quality assessment practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10449)|
| 2:54:16| that generate accurate, useful evidence of student learning to support instruction and student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10456)|
| 2:54:23| As an educator, we know that individual students deserve learning opportunities that are differentiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10463)|
| 2:54:29| and responsive to their needs, interests, and learning styles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| How we assess students should reflect these priorities and be designed by educators, the professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10473)|
| 2:54:41| in partnership with stakeholders to allow all students to demonstrate the full breadth of their knowledge and skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10481)|
| 2:54:49| Each one of our children, our students, are unique and wonderfully made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10489)|
| 2:54:56| And every student, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, or where they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10496)|
| 2:55:02| deserves access to a great and excellent public school education that will empower them to achieve their dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10502)|
| 2:55:11| I'm asking our board to be encouraged to support and ask our legislators to amend Tennessee Code Annotated 49-6-3115| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10511)|
| 2:55:24| and support for student promotion and retention decisions to be based on a combination of evidence from a variety of sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10524)|
| 2:55:34| Set at liberty our third and fourth graders so they will have the freedom to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10534)|
| 2:55:41| Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak on behalf of the least of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10541)|
| 2:55:49| Thank you. Angel Jones, please state your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10549)|
| 2:56:00| Angel Jones, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10560)|
| 2:56:04| I appreciate all the work that everybody has put into talking about the third grade retention resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10564)|
| 2:56:11| I think that it's imperative that we get something together that does get passed by all of our board members or by the majority on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10571)|
| 2:56:20| because I think that by making a statement to the rest of our state, to our legislators, and joining the rest of everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10580)|
| 2:56:30| is a huge thing, because there is a lot that's already been speaking out about it, and I think we need to speak out about it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10590)|
| 2:56:38| And if I could, could I say something about the playground thing as well, if that's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10598)|
| 2:56:45| Okay, I also just want to say that playing childhood imagination is incredibly important for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10605)|
| 2:56:52| and I also think that the school board should absolutely be funding these playgrounds and not just the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10612)|
| 2:56:59| and I commend those for speaking out about the blatantly obvious disparities shown in putting what that funding has done onto our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10619)|
| 2:57:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10629)|
| 2:57:13| Lance McLeod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| Lance McLeod, Knox County. Madam Chair, members of the board, thank you for hearing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10638)|
| 2:57:25| I wanted to mostly talk about Item 9D, but I wanted to say a word first about this Policy B140, about the agenda-setting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10645)|
| 2:57:39| In the last six months, there has been a member of the public at almost every single one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10659)|
| 2:57:45| Those are valuable to the people, the members of the community, so that we understand things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10665)|
| 2:57:49| Often we learn things at those meetings that we don't learn at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| So I would encourage you to retain public notice, because that's the only way we're going to find out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10673)|
| 2:57:59| So now, let me say about this, it's the team for the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10679)|
| 2:58:09| I was putting myself in your shoes and I was saying, dang, the administration doesn't respect you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10689)|
| 2:58:20| because they gave you this list of names with no reasons why these people were picked, no evidence that they were the best people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10700)|
| 2:58:28| The staff members, I'm just really looking at the three community members, because who in the heck are those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10708)|
| 2:58:35| Do those people show up at board meetings? Do those people show any evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| And there was no evidence, nothing given, in what the administration gave you about why these people are the right people to serve on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10719)|
| 2:58:49| I did a little research to look them up, and I still can't find why they are the right people to serve on this committee to look at these charter applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10729)|
| 2:58:59| But it sort of hit me, this happens so often, so often the administration just throws you something with not a sufficient amount of information to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10739)|
| 2:59:11| They say, trust me. Well, I follow President Reagan who said, trust and verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10751)|
| 2:59:17| Your job as school board members is to verify. Not to do the superintendent's job, but to make sure he's doing the right job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10757)|
| 2:59:25| And if you don't know who he's putting on these committees, you aren't doing any verification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10765)|
| 2:59:30| So I would urge you to demand more respect from the administration and say, you know, you want me to approve this list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10770)|
| 2:59:40| You want me to approve something? Give me the reasons why that's the thing to do it, instead of just putting it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10780)|
| 2:59:46| So thank you for the work you do. Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| Thank you. That concludes public forum, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10790)|
| 2:59:54| Before we move to board forum, Dr. Reislich, during break I think you said something about that second charter application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10794)|
| 3:00:04| I didn't know if you wanted to clarify that that just came through today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10804)|
| 3:00:09| No, I appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah, I was unaware that we had received it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10809)|
| 3:00:13| So I think it was one of those that was kind of postmarked today and came through the front office, as I learned during our break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10813)|
| 3:00:19| Because today was the deadline. Right, I think today was the deadline. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10819)|
| 3:00:24| So moving on to board forum, Ms. Decker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10824)|
| 3:00:28| I just wanted to say I hope that all the students finish the fall semester well and have a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10828)|
| 3:00:35| Thank you. Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10838)|
| 3:00:43| I was just remarking to someone that this was about 95 days in of me being on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10843)|
| 3:00:52| And we've had a lot of discussion about so many important things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10852)|
| 3:00:56| But I do not want to lose sight that in District 1 we still have three schools, four schools that are on the state list of the highest priorities or the lowest performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10856)|
| 3:01:13| And that we also have to be thinking, I think about it every day, what we're going to do to make sure that our kids, all of our kids in Knox County, are getting the best education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10873)|
| 3:01:27| But those in District 1, the needs that we have will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10887)|
| 3:01:34| So I don't want to lose sight of that as we talk about so many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| And all of these things are important and were important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| But that is something that I think we have to make sure that we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10901)|
| 3:01:46| It's not a District 1 issue and it's not a District 1 problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10906)|
| 3:01:50| It's a Knox County issue and a Knox County problem or a Knox County concern, a Knox County challenge, a Knox County opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10910)|
| 3:02:00| So I'll be looking forward to more discussion about what we can do as a whole to help this part of our district that we know needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10920)|
| 3:02:10| Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10930)|
| 3:02:12| Merry Christmas. Thank you, Mr. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10932)|
| 3:02:15| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| I just want to give two little shout outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=10939)|
