| 0:12:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| I'm now going to defer to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| This property has a variance approved on May the 28th of 08, reducing the 500 down to 137 feet to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=773)|
| 0:13:06| Just make a note of that, that it was approved in 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Okay, so we need a CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| And going back to Health Department, can you give us an idea of what the impediment is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| The inspector mentioned that he had never heard back from the CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| We can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| The applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| The inspector mentioned that she had not heard back from the owner of the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| and she needs to go and make an inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Bottom line, ma'am, the onus is on you to ensure that you communicate with these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Until you do, I won't speak for the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| but generally that's going to be an impediment to getting your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Commissioner Wright, do you have a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=828)|

| 0:14:05| All those in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=851)|

| 0:14:28| So I'm going to ask you a series of questions, as you probably heard previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| Have you or any of your employees of this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| sale, manufacture or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| We'll need a copy of your current business license that you have with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| but has beer been sold to this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Do you own this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=894)|

| 0:15:04| You'll operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee Beer Laws and Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Have you had a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| When do you anticipate doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| I'm going to then defer to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=919)|

| 0:15:23| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Less than 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| They're 20 feet to a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| Do you have a liquor license, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Do you not, Mr. Tregester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| I have applied for a liquor license, and they're waiting on me to pay the fee and put the bond up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| I had a visit from the fire marshal last Monday, and I did not pay it, based on just getting everything satisfied with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=942)|
| 0:15:52| Based on what you've heard earlier here today, I would suggest it makes it more legal if you do go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=952)|
| 0:16:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=962)|

| 0:16:04| It's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=965)|

| 0:16:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=971)|

| 0:16:22| Motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Is there a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926beerpart1?start=983)|
