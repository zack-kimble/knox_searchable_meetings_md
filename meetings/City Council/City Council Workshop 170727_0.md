| 0:01:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| Sorry, Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| We started a minute earlier without you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| I know you're psyched for the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| The purpose of today's workshop is to hear from Jeff Archer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| an MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| and to discuss the sitting county's ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| for cell phone or cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| And we also welcome John Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Johnny, it's good to have you here with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| And thanks for all your efforts to bring this about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| and working with MPC to bring this about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| So we appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| So with that, Jeff, it's yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| Thanks for the opportunity to come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| and present this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| We've been working on this since basically March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| It's a wireless communications facilities ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| and one of the goals as far as the ordinance revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| is we wanted to keep similar ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| So this is a presentation that covers really both ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| What I'm going to go through is a little discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| as far as how technology has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| and the impact of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| I'm going to talk about issues as far as the current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| talk about some of the similarities and differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| between the existing ordinances and the proposed ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| and then I'll go into some of the more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| as far as some of the siting and design criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| that's in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| So if you look at the evolution of 3G to 5G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| the fifth generation is what we're approaching now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| When the 2000-2001 ordinance was first written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| we were transitioning from 2G to 3G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| and 3G is significant because that's when data became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| Before, 2G was just phone and texting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| So here you could look at a two-hour movie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| and the download speeds for 3G at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| took 26 hours to download it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| With 5G, it's projected to be 3.6 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| So there's a huge evolution as far as the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| The number of people that have cell phones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| and the usage is dramatically going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| For example, in 1990, two out of every hundred people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| had a mobile subscription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| That number in 2000 jumped to 39,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| and then in 2010, that number came up to 92| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| out of every hundred people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| So there's a lot more people, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| that are using the mobile subscriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and the technology associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| The old kind of paradigm as far as providing cell coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| used to be about mainly coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| but now it's about capacity also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| It's coverage and capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| It's something newer to the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| as far as dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| So kind of the issues with the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| of the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| It's outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Last time it was updated was 2001-2002 time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| It relies on a separate plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| It's called a Wireless Communications Facilities Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| that City Council and County Commission adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| However, the plan was really written as a guiding policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| and the ordinance doesn't incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| the actual design standards within the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| So one of the things that we wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| is take the things that are applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| in the Wireless Communications Facilities Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| and make those standards right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| within the existing or proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| Some of the other major differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| is the old ordinance didn't have height limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| It was also based on what I refer to as character areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| So on the left-hand side of this matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| which is out of the Wireless Communications Facilities Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| you'll see things like wooded area or pastured land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| things like that, things that aren't measurable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| that are subjective as far as the interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| And I think this brings an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| as far as during the approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| of the neighborhoods and residents interpreting one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| and possibly the applicant or staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| interpreting it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| So there's a lot of interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| We wanted to basically make the new facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| or the new ordinance zone-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| based on the zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| So that's a major change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| Also, Every Tower currently comes under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| the use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| meaning it goes before MPC regardless of where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| And we wanted to basically streamline good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| There's areas, and I'll get into these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| that I think are more preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| and areas that are less preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| And so let's streamline the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| for the ones that are more preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| So looking at some of the particulars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| as far as the major differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| like I said, the other ordinance relies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| on the Wireless Communications Facilities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| We incorporated the standards right in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| We have location priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| We're going to require alternative site analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| It's connected to the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| The ordinance currently has drafted the limits to monopoles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| So the lattice towers would not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| And we actually described two monopoles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| and I'll get into this a little bit further in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| We have a height limitation of a maximum of 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| 200 feet is a significant number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| because when you go above 200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| you actually have to have the lights on top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| for air traffic control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| unless you're in a flight pattern area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| We wanted to streamline it as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| encouraging administrative approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| There's new technology coming on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| particularly with regards to small cell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| and we wanted to include standards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| Separation standards as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| not having two towers concentrated close together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| if there are two towers, to make sure they're dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| The landscaping and screening standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| This is a big issue, I think, near the residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| where the current ordinance basically says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| if you provide a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| then you don't have to provide landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| A lot of times the base stations have to be chain-link fenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| and so they don't have to be landscaped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| as far as the ordinance is addressed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| Also, with the current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| we've run into issues as far as co-location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| We encourage multiple antenna arrays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| as you can see on the bottom slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| You've seen these probably all around at the bottom picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=544)|
| 0:09:12| One of the issues that's happening is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| when an applicant was coming to add on to an existing tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| there was not enough room in the base station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| to accommodate the equipment, the ground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| So there's standards set forth for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| Just going through some of the similarities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| we incorporated many of the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| that are in the plan and also beefed some of them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| Priority location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| While the other one was bag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| we got a little more specific as far as the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| The existing ordinance has a high priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| as far as co-location on existing towers and structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| That's a high priority within this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Also, the 110% provision as far as the setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| we incorporated that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| So looking at the proposed ordinance...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| If it falls, you've got 10% margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| You'll hear some communities use a breakpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| what they call a breakpoint technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| where if you provide engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| draw an engineer stamp that there's the tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| and it's designed to break at a certain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| You may hear from the providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| as far as wanting breakpoint technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| because that would be a decreased setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| But we thought the 110% was a good standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| The other thing it does is by federal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| that you have to allow a 10% expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| what they call a minor expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| So if a tower is 100% to 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| it's actually taking care of that 10% too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| In the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| So like any kind of ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| we're doing this to protect the health, safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| and welfare of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| But also an important thing as far as locating cell towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| is to make sure that they're in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| that fit into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| It's an infrastructure that is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| and is used by everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Everyone wants cellular coverage wherever they go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| and they want data wherever they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| But it's about making it try to fit into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| as best as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| We're encouraging co-location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| The ordinance as it's drafted is really protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| the residential areas, historic areas, and scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| And I'll get into that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| As you see, as I showed early on in the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| there is a growing demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| So we need to accommodate this as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| It's something that everybody wants and needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| And we want to minimize the impacts, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| as far as where they're sited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| We want to be able to encourage the latest technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| and establish clear standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| for the orderly processing of permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| So this kind of gets into the meat of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| as far as the most preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| So our most preferred is co-location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Now, this could mean on an existing tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| like you see on the left-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| This could mean on a water tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| like you see in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| Or it could be buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| As you see on the right, there's antennas on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| But also we incorporated some standards within there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| to make sure that antennas weren't located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| on the edge of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| And also some camouflaging techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| to make them camouflage into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| Our second priority is small cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| And this is more of the new technology that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| This is actually, if you could make this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| it's a little hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| There's two little white areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| They almost look like banners on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| That's actually, this is in a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| And that's small cell antennas on a light fixture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| a parking lot light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| This would be the example of anywhere in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| any shopping mall, you could picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| they have the infrastructure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| So it could be small cell technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| And small cell mainly is just lower power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| and less distance as far as the transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| On the right, you probably have heard in the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| regarding small cell in the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| This is kind of where the demand is really going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| as far as providing technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| The companies are trying to be treated as utility companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| Some communities have dealt with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| through their zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| But talking to city and county staff and MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| I think there's a clear consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| that zoning wasn't the right mechanism for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| So there are guidelines that were adopted by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| that have been incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| to the city's land development manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| And the county is also working on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| and moving forward with their engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| So it would be just an engineering permit process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| in the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| It would not go through a zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| Before you leave that picture, the bottom picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| where is the small cell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| There's not on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| I just kind of just picture any kind of parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| with the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Trying to fake us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| There's not any on private property in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| So the least preferred is new towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| But within that, there's a priority itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| And these are zone-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| So if you're going to provide a new tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| you couldn't co-locate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| and you have to provide that infrastructure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| The preferential area would be industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| or business park zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| And that would be number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Number two would be commercial and office zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| Three is other zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| Other zones mainly are ag and open space districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| And the last one is the residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| scenic highways, and historic overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| So the way the application process would be set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| would be if somebody wanted to locate in priority four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| which would be residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| scenic highways, and historic areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| then they would actually have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| and prove that within their coverage area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| there weren't areas that were industrial, commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| or office that could accommodate their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| So this is the monopole type one and type two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| The one on the left incorporates stealth technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| where you cannot see the antennas in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| It's disguised in the swollen kind of area up top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| And there's two of them that you can see in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| One, if you're driving along 640,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| you could see it along Pleasant Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| the bridge area behind a church along Pleasant Road in 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| And the other one is off of Central near 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| as you're coming from the 640 area going to 75 north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| You look over on the right and you'll see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| So the difference between them mainly is type one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| is a shorter height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| It has a smaller equipment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| and the antennas are disguised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| Number two is you see these all around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| These are traditionally taller, multiple antenna arrays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| and they do not incorporate stealth technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| So this is a summary as far as the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| This is out of the Knox County Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| They're very similar as far as the city versus the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| So if you look at industrial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| small cell is permitted, monopole type one and type two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| maximum of 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Stealth design is encouraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| and there's administrative review process on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| Office commercial, small cell, monopole type one, type two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| goes down to 150 feet, still encouraging stealth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| and it's an administrative review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| The other districts, as far as like your ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| and your open space districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| are small cell, monopole type one, 125 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| encouraging stealth and having that as administrative review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Now on the city one, we also have the forum base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| which is the same as the other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| So that would be on the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| and Cumberland Avenue, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| And then our residential category is still small cell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| but monopole type one only, and 125 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| and that would go through a public hearing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| which would be the Metropolitan Planning Commission going to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| rather than having a staff approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Same thing with the overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| They would be going through a public hearing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| The only zone that we don't have it permitted in right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| is the floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| So kind of where we are in the process and where we've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| we did thorough research as far as looking at cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| and counties across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| We used 16 communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| and with a caveat that they've adopted standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| within the last five or so years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| We have analyzed the existing ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| and talked about and identified the things for improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| We drafted the ordinance and met with city and county staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| to review these and incorporated their changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| based on their comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| We shared this with attorneys that represent the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| and also the providers themselves and the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| And we've shared all this stuff on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| Where we are in the process as far as the next steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| after this meeting would be it's scheduled to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| on the August agenda for MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| but the recommendation is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| We just basically want to help get the word out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| for the neighbors and the residents that this is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| We're going to hold a public workshop on August 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| at 6.30 at the counselor YMCA where everyone's invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| We're going to give kind of a similar presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| as far as an overview of the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| And we're going to, September 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| if everything goes as smoothly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| would be going to MPC and then thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| city council and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| One of the things early on in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| and RGS, geographic information system team or mapping team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| has actually been able to map all the different kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| of cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| And this is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| we're going to have this inventory going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| And this is key if this ordinance moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| as is drafted now with things like the spacing limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| in the zoning districts where the towers are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| and trying to identify co-location is a high priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| We're also, this is on our case view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| so it's publicly available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| So any of the providers would be able to use this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| also to make their application a better application overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| And that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| Nick, you got questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Let me just add, there was a time maybe a year and a half ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| when we were involved in a cell tower up in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| in a residential area that was some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| And there was discussion that there might be a city grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| with one mile square kind of boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| and there would be cell towers in every grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| and maybe in every corner of every grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| and that seemed overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| How does that look now with this different technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| and the approaches you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| Are we going to have a continuing large growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| of these structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Or does the change in technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| mitigate some of the expansion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| I think what you're going to see from everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| that I've researched in talking to the providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| is that you're going to see the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| as far as the number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| as far as the providers being located in the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| because it's an easier process to control pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| because it would be controlled at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| A lot of states are controlling the pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| for the permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Go to the plan folks and get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| You don't have to go through a whole zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| And there's design parameters in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| as far as the size, how they appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| There's three small cells all on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| that's done by a company called ZAO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| and they worked with the city and did a test pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| We also worked with city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| to develop the guidelines for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| So if you know where Toddy's is in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| there's one right in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| You have to look really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| They're pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| There's one in front of Cherokee Plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| a little further into Bearden as you go west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And then there's one all the way over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| where Academy Sports is on that side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| right in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| So there might be more of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| but they're slower and less obtrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| The change to 5G is probably going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| smaller towers closer together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| because it's no longer about sheer coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| It's about capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| The difference is where there's heavy burden areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| as far as usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| So they want to basically take...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Megabits or whatever moving across them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Data and streaming and all that stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| And if you think of the evolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| probably everybody has a smartphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| I would imagine, in their pocket right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| But you've heard about the Internet of Things coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| and autonomous cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| So there's going to be more devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| that are going to be using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| So it's going to be more and more about capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| as far as...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Like the ones on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| they're tied to fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| So there's fiber running along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| They're tied to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| and they actually communicate to a cell tower at Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| And so it gives them coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| and it gives them coverage in an area of high demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| on Arterial Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| In the pictures you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| and I'll turn this over to someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I didn't see any, like, TVA power line towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| Can't they use those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| and mount a broadcasting device on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| You had a water tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| but I didn't see the power lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| which have a lot of structures out there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| You can locate on any structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| the way the ordinance is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| We had a good example of the water tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| as in Buffett Mill Road over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| and that's a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| And so I just was trying to capture some pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| that it doesn't have to be cell towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| and it doesn't have to be buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| that there is a variety of structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Pre-existing structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Pre-existing structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| That you can just mount some kind of unit on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| The monopole type one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| can you co-locate on those as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Those, it's smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Like the ones that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| they're actually both at churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| They're in back of churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| The two existing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| And they have two co-locations on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| So they're stacked inside that tube that swells out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| They're basically stacked on top of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| So I guess the answer is yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| but not as much as the type two version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| And the stealth is something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| than the monopole type one, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| We have, now stealth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| depending on different communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| they define it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| To, stealth is kind of a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| You can do stealth from like one to ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| So ten being like really disguised in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| That would be like a church steeple or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| where you can't see at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| And the monopole type one would be more like a one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| as far as stealth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| You just can't see the antennas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| because they're hidden into the actual structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| And in terms of the height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| these heights that are proposed here in the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| towards the end, are those adjustable or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| They're set as far as maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| We do have a provision in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| that you can go beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| but there has to be extenuating circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| where the provider has to prove that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| whether it's due to topography or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| that they have to go above that height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| But is there a federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| is 125 sort of the federal minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| or could we go 100 or 30 feet or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| Well, you do run into, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| once you get closer to the probably 80 to 100 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| you get in some carriers don't prefer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| The two monopoles that are hidden in the churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| they're 125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| That's their current height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| Once you go above 200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| you're usually not into a monopole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| you're into a lattice style tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| One of the things that we really thought was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| and I think you could see it from that chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| is there's a priority and less intensive uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| as far as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| We want them to blend into the community a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| but if it's an industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| then there's usually bigger buildings and wider spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| That's why there's 200 feet on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| I just didn't know if the 125 was sort of as low as it could go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| The existing ordinance has 130 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| as far as there's a co-location standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| So if you're below 130 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| you can do two co-locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| and if you're above 130 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| you have to do a minimum of three co-locations on a tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| Is that in the new one or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| That's in both of them, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| That's one of the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Except we've shifted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| It's not 130 anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Since we went with 125, it brought it down five feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| so it's 125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Dan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| I wanted to ask you about the map that you had up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Is that the existing cell towers that we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| And actually, they're classified, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| So the red ones are monopole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| The bluish ones are lattice style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| The green are broadcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Purple is they're located on a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| And orange, which would be a stealth technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| And the yellow would be guide towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| where they have the cables coming from them as support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| called guide towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| And then the black are the two water tower locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| Well, if I was not colorblind, it would be helpful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| I can't really tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| I have a question I want to ask you about the monopole type 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| and type 2 in terms of costs for those two different types of poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| Which one would be the most costly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| I can't answer that as far as I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| It's something we can look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| It's not something that we looked at as far as knowing that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| from the providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I'm sure there's a high variation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| A lot of it, I think, would come down to the different styles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| Well, monopole type 1 is pretty much a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| Monopole type 2 can have a lot of variation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| So it could have variation as far as the height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| and then the number of rays on it can vary also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| So there's some variability probably in the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| but I could look into that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Over here, we have a process update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| and you all compared different cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| Do you look at cities of similar population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| or does that really matter or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| We looked at a lot of times Knoxville is compared to Albuquerque,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| and that was one of the ones we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| A lot of the design standards that we thought were the best came from Spokane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| Spokane, Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| So they went through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Theirs is a lot more complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| We tried to simplify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| For example, they have three application processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| So we tried to use some of their design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| but also look at ours and things that made sense from our standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| bring those forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| And theirs and some of the more progressive, in my viewpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| go to the siting criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| And putting the burden on the applicant is when they make an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| to prove that they looked at alternative sites and to document that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| Another question I wanted to ask you while we're talking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| Verizon applied to have a cell tower sort in the heart of Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| Where does that stand now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| What's the status on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| That was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Temporarily, at least, they were told to look at alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| and the company said they were going to sort of put that application to sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| and take a second look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| So it's sort of on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| It's not pending in any sense like they're going to process it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| but it may come back tomorrow, who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| John, you had a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Or two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| I didn't say two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Well, I had an opportunity in the fall to go to a seminar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| on the small cell support structures and the distributed antenna systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| And if you can put the map back up on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| And because when the rollout of the 5G technology is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| it's my understanding that we'll have ten times more cell towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| than we have currently on that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Now, we're not talking about ten times more 150-foot monopoles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| We're talking about ten times more with the 27 to 30-foot poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| Is that still the information that you're getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| Probably at that conference you heard a lot as far as locating in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And that's one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| And I think Knoxville and Knox County was really smart in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| is that everybody wants the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| The 5G, the new towers are going to be the small towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| that are going to be in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| And we're not going to do that through the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| That's going to be an engineering permit process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| just like somebody putting up a light pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| I think it was the opinion of staff is put the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| put yourselves in a very odd situation since you don't review the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| of light poles to be reviewing something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| And then the small cell support structures have to be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| about three football fields apart or 900 feet apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| because of the condensed bandwidth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| So it's not like you're having a pole at one end of Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| and one at the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| It's every 900 feet in the right-of-way you have to have a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| And then it's my understanding that TVA will not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| the companies to put it on their superstructures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| any kind of location there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| but KUB will allow them to put it on their utility poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| But out west, Lenore City Utilities at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| would not allow an antenna to go on one of their poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| Is that still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Yeah, there's a couple of things on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| I've heard the same thing with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| We might be having the providers are working at the federal level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| to get things passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| So the stance on TVA may be forced to change in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| I don't know as far as allowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| I'm sorry, what was the other part of the question as far as the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| You mentioned KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Oh, the KUB, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I think Christy can help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| The city is taking over the light poles from KUB, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| I think that is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| It's part of the replacement of the light bulbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| part of that whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| One of the things we actually engaged when we were developing the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| for the city and the county for the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| we engaged LCUB in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| So they were at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| So the county staff wanted to make sure that all the utility companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| So I think it was more of an educational process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| I think that they learned through the process and talking to KUB staff also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| as far as what is designed and required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| The hard situation in the county as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| now this doesn't do with the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| but as far as that right-of-way is going to be when, or in the city too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| when you have a subdivision maybe that doesn't have any above ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| infrastructure in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| and their provider is going to want to come in and put a new pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Now we do have provisions in those, which is separate from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| that they can do banners or decorative lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| things like that that can be viewed as an asset in a community that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| not have above ground utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| And like when I was talking to a provider from Charlotte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| and Charlotte's gone through a similar process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| and what they require is that the applicant provide three different designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| when there is no above ground infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| and they hold a public meeting and basically let people decide as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| what they think fits into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| One more quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| The town of Farragut had their telecommunications ordinance in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| in April of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| They specifically broke out regulations for the small cell support structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| Had you all looked at that, and are you considering that so that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| because the county obviously incorporates the area around Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| so that those match together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| Well, we thought it was very important to take the design principles that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| in the right-of-way guidelines that the city and the county are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| using and anything that was applicable to bring that forward in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| There are some slight variations where the guidelines talk about a pole height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| to match the existing poles, new poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| to any infrastructure that's around or buildings that are around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| So if you're next to an office building that is six stories high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| you can put a bigger pole there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Or if there's existing light poles that are around that are taller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| then you can locate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| But there is a provision as far as 36 feet being the maximum in the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| that we wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| And hearing from some of the comments from the providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| they wanted that number up to 40 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| and this would be in the zoning ordinance for a parking lot kind of design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| So there is a maximum of 40 foot if there's not infrastructure around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| you can prove that you need to go up to a certain height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| We have one person signed up for public forum, Jacob Gibbs from Verizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2430)|
| 0:40:43| State your name and your address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| It's Jacob Gibson at 1002 East Tacoma Circle, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| I'm an associate at Baker, Donaldson, Behrman, Caldwell, and Berkowitz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| here on behalf of Verizon Wireless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| We submitted comments to Mr. Archer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| and very much appreciate his consideration on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| There are a couple of quick things I want to revisit or go over with the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| if you'll allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I think most of our comments have been subtleties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| in order to sort of soften some of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| One such example would be new WCES are required under this proposed draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| to camouflage, disguise, or conceal and to make compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| and blend into the setting in which they're being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| We would say that to the extent practicable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| they should be required to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| One bigger point I would like to address is the issue of separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| This proposed draft has that my understanding is the towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| shall have a minimum separation of 1,500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| We would do away with this provision entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| and propose that the council consider that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| the reason being there are circumstances in which towers need to be closer together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| unavoidable circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| and at least there ought to be some kind of exception for those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| Do you have an example of the exceptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| No, sir, I do not at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I've been sort of quickly briefed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| I'm by no means a cell tower expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| I wanted to at least voice on the record some of our positions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| I'll move on real quickly because I know I'm burning through time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| As Mr. Archer mentioned, we would like for there to be an exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| that allows for a certificate from a structural engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| saying that if a tower collapses upon itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| is designed to do that and is assured to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| then the setback of I believe it was 110 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| oh, excuse me, 110% of the height of the tower should not be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| As Mr. Archer mentioned, this exception is being allowed in a lot of municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| and is sort of a growing trend is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| So with a certificate from an engineer, we think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| And last but not least, as you may have guessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| we would like the council to consider not adopting the height restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2606)|
| 0:43:34| With height restrictions, carriers are forced to build additional towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| One, my understanding is that this does not provide the kind of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| that consumers have come to expect, that carriers like to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2625)|
| 0:43:53| that I suppose there's not the kind of data that can stream through multiple small structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| that there would be through a large one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| And that's what would happen with height restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| You'd have a lot more smaller structures popping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| So that does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| I thank you all for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Nobody else has signed up? No other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| I didn't see your name on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Councilman, I failed to sign up. I apologize for not signing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| We'll take a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| I just learned about 15 minutes ago that we have had apparently a catastrophic failure with Minitrack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2673)|
| 0:44:42| And our people have been trying very hard to get the agenda out all afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| But because of Minitrack going completely down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| apparently they're going to be unable to get it out tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| and we will get it to you at least by tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| If we can't get it out tonight, it will at least get to you by tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| So we apologize for that delay in getting the agenda to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| I have seen the agenda. It's not huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| So hopefully it won't create a serious problem for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| and we will get it to you just as soon as we can, and we apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Did lightning strike the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Several times today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| I don't think there's any relation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| All right. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170727?start=2720)|
