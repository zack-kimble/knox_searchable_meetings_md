| 0:00:00| We're going to do that short beer board meeting, but I do want to call the meeting of October 9th to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=0)|
| 0:00:09| I'd like to ask Ms. Pilo to lead us in vocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=9)|
| 0:00:12| And now that he's back at full speed, we'll ask Vice Mayor Brown to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| Just stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=17)|
| 0:00:24| As we join together, just before we join together in prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=24)|
| 0:00:30| there was something in our church bulletin Sunday that I thought was a very meaningful thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| and I really wanted to share it with everyone, so I will read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=36)|
| 0:00:40| It's the wise words of a very wise man, Mahatma Gandhi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=40)|
| 0:00:45| If you love peace, then hate injustice, hate tyranny, hate greed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=45)|
| 0:00:54| but hate these things in yourself, not in another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=54)|
| 0:01:00| Those are just some words of thought for us for the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| If you'll bow your heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| Our Heavenly Father, it is good to come before you and to lay our lives out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| and give thought to what you would have us be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| We pray that you will give us hearts of love, of justice, of sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=80)|
| 0:01:30| hands open to helping others and volunteering to make this a wonderful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=90)|

| 0:02:53| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of our last meeting of September 25th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=177)|

| 0:03:04| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| I want to withdraw 9A, which is the solicitation in intersections ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| We had a workshop on this last week, and I think it's the will of council that we ban solicitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| in intersections completely, and I think we'll be coming up with an ordinance on that in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| So I'd like to move that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| The motion to second is to withdraw 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Is there any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=218)|

| 0:03:51| Mayor Haslund, I move that item number 11I be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| 11I is dealing with the Turkey Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=241)|

| 0:04:17| 11L is dealing with the resolution concerning the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| The motion is to postpone 11L for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=271)|

| 0:04:45| Yeah, I'd like to postpone 11N for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| This is the Oakwood-Lincoln Park down zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=291)|

| 0:05:08| I'm gone in two weeks, so you all just keep coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=314)|

| 0:05:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=331)|

| 0:05:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Let's move to mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| 6A is an application for a retailer certificate for Tad Liquors owned by Andrew L. Hilmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| David R. Sprouse, and Thomas F. Schaffler, Jr., DBA Emory Road Liquor and Wine, 7510 Barnet Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=344)|
| 0:05:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| There are folks signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| One person signed up to speak, actually, against, and then three people signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| So I guess those who signed up to speak in favor, we have Mr. Seymour, Mr. Hilmer, and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=370)|
| 0:06:22| Jeff Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Jeff Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| I couldn't quite read your writing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| Mr. Mayor, Arthur Seymour, Jr., this application meets all the requirements of the city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| We learned that somebody was opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Could we reserve our time to respond to any statements they make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| Because we don't know why there would be any opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| I think you'll have two minutes to respond at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| I guess council could ask you further questions if they weren't clear at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| I understood there might be a question about an issue of distance from St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| Mr. Jeff Miller, he is a registered surveyor in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| He has certified that it is 500 feet from our lease line to that, to the St. Mary's property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=425)|
| 0:07:14| St. Mary's Hospital at Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| There was also an allegation that it was too close to a daycare center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| The ordinance does not speak to daycare centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| But just to be on the safe side, Mr. Miller measured that distance and it was over 700 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Those are the only known bases that we have heard in a roundabout way from the city business tax office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| that there may be any opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| But I would reserve the two minutes to respond if there is any other opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| Lynn Beeler has signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Lynn Beeler, 8241 Elm Hill Circle, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Our only concern was that the publication in the newspaper did not meet the code requirements for size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=482)|
| 0:08:10| and actually wording of the announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Our only concern was that people need to follow the rules like everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| The article that was put in was under legals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| It was listed as public notice according to the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| It should have said retail liquor license notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| It also should have been at least two columns wide and two inches long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| It was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| That was only our problem we had with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| We just want everybody to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Mr. Seymour, would you like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| I think Ms. Beeler owns a liquor store at this interchange also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| The notice that is required by the liquor ordinance of the city of Knoxville requires posting on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=530)|
| 0:09:00| which was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| It also requires that there be newspaper notice ten days ahead of the meeting, which was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| and that the newspaper notice basically comply with the notice that was placed on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=548)|
| 0:09:16| and they are basically the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| 4-132 of the city ordinance says that the applicant, subparagraph B1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=560)|
| 0:09:30| promptly and conspicuously posts the proposed premises with a clean, neat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| and legible sign approximately 24 inches by 36 inches in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| stating the name and address of the applicant, the nature of the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| and the date upon which the application is to be originally acted upon by the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| The sign to be placed so as to provide at least ten days notice to the public of the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| upon which the application is to be originally acted upon by the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| That was posted on the property well over ten days prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| The ordinance also says that the applicant must place at least one advertisement at his own expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| in a newspaper of general daily circulation in the city no less than seven days prior to his application being acted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| upon originally by the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| The advertisement to contain essentially the same information as required for the posting of the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| as set out in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| The applicant did that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Any questions from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I think there was a motion and a second to approve, wasn't there, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Seeing no further discussion, all those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=641)|

| 0:11:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| A couple of three quick items on mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| Number one, to remind folks this week we're having this Saturday we're having our inaugural cross Knox run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| The uniqueness about it is we're actually running on continuous greenways all the way from East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| to West Knoxville starting at Alex Haley statue, ending up at Bearden Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| or actually Knoxville Adaptive Education Center right next to Bearden, and then buses back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| and some great refreshments afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| So I encourage everyone to either come out and run or come out and watch and enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| Mayor, are you aware that your council is participating as a relay team in the cross Knox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| I would love to hear more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Councilman Frost gets all the credit for the idea, but we've been the coordinating group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| and nearly all members of council are participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Vice Mayor Brown has obtained a fabulous baton and will start us off at Morningside Park with a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| Councilmember Frost will then take the downhill start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| I have requested a strong, stiff wind behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| We'll pass off the baton at appropriate points, at which point Councilwoman Pilo will receive us in her second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| at Bearden Elementary School to great applause and success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| What a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| I did not know that, but that's a terrific idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| I look forward to sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| There hasn't been an enormous amount of taxing in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| Quite an extensive effort that these two have made to coordinate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| I was just going to say that I was going to be running as anchor, not like bringing it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Anchor in the boat sense, slowing everybody down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Anyway, that's this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| I obviously look forward to everybody being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| I want to congratulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| We had 30 new graduates of the Knoxville Fire Department Academy join the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| I joined the Knoxville Fire Department last night in a wonderful ceremony at Chief Key,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| and then we had four captains promoted to assistant chief last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| I want to thank the members of council who were at each of those ceremonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| It's now my privilege to welcome several of our several visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| and I'm going to ask our delegation if they would come forward maybe to the podium there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| and welcome our out-of-town visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| I might maybe let their hosts maybe go to the microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| and maybe just give us a quick little summary of who the group is and their purpose in being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=810)|
| 0:13:40| Mayor, thank you, and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| My name is Chuck Shoopman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| I work with the University of Tennessee's Institute for Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| And joining me tonight is Mr. Rich Davis with the University of Tennessee's Institute of Agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| and it's our pleasure to host a delegation of Russian leaders who are participating in the Library of Congress's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| Open World Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| It's a leadership development and exchange program for emerging leaders from Russia to come visit with leaders in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=842)|
| 0:14:12| and share ideas and interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| This group of delegates ranges from as far east in Russia as Vladivostok, a port city on the Pacific Coast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=855)|
| 0:14:26| to as far west as about 300 miles west of Moscow in Olov City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=866)|
| 0:14:37| So Andre and Andre and Yelena and Boris and Ivan and our interpreter is Olga from here in east Tennessee in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=877)|
| 0:14:51| And so we are delighted to have the opportunity to come and introduce them to a council meeting here in Knoxville tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=891)|
| 0:15:01| see how you guys do business, and give them something to compare to in how they do business at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=901)|
| 0:16:01| So, Andre and Yelena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=961)|
| 0:16:09| And Yelena Kornova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=969)|
| 0:16:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| And we welcome all of you once again to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| I think that's it for Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| 7A is the Police Advisory Review Committee, their annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| I think actually before they present that, I actually have another presentation to thank three folks who are retiring from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| Police Advisory Review Committee who have done a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| This really is an incredibly important group that works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| And really what they do is help us get involved in some issues that are, quite frankly, very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| And they do it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| They've obviously been ably led by Carol Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| But I am very proud of this group and very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| These are all folks who are retiring who were all appointed by Mayor Ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| But they have all really served our city very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| And I'd love to give you all three of their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| And I'm going to make you all walk all the way up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| And I'm going to present these to you one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| But first, Vivian Nguyen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Vivian, thank you so much for your years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1061)|
| 0:17:57| Reverend James McCluskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1077)|
| 0:18:09| And finally, the retiring chairperson of this, Robin Jarvis Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1095)|
| 0:18:24| These folks have not only served the committee, but they've taken their work very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| And I'm, like I said, very grateful for them doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| With that, I think I'm going to turn it back over to the committee who is going to present us with their annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| I think it will be the former chairperson, Ms. Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| I appreciate the opportunity to have served with this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| I would like to ask, before we get started, for all the folks from the committee who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Unbelievably, all the 2006 members and the new replacements for 2007 are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| Replacing the three of us who you just named are Judge Robert Murrion, Rabbi Beth Schwartz, and Juanita Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| So, if all of you would please stand, I would really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| The other members here are Avis Reed, who is a new chair, and Mr. William Cole, Mr. Santos Aguilar, and Reverend George Lyons, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1154)|
| 0:19:32| As you mentioned, the purpose of the Police Advisory and Review Committee is to coordinate communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| between the Police Department and the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| And we do that through accepting complaints, reviewing complaints, going through the review process with those citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| Since September 22, 1998, we have had 1,449 cases brought before this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| Last year, we had 127 cases that were opened and 127 cases that were resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| We also continued our work last year with coordinating with the community through the Citizens Police Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1201)|
| 0:20:10| the ITT Technical Institute, Ms. Scott did a program there as an adjunct professor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| and she also continues her work with the KPD's Basic Recruit Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| In addition, I volunteered, and you can probably see why, for the YWMCA Wing Fest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| because if you went, you could eat all the wings you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| And Park did a booth at the Wing Fest, and we've also done a lot of outreach through the Speaker's Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| and the other things that we have always done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| And one of the more important things that I think we do, and we can take no credit for it because it belongs to Ms. Scott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| she is on the board of the National Association of Citizens Groups, NACOL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| and she continues to go to those meetings, represent Knoxville in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| that we are continually called upon to ask, how do you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| How do you make this such a positive experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Anyway, I would like to take this moment publicly to say thanks to Ms. Scott for her hard work, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| In the report that you all have a copy of, you have a ton of statistics and other matters set forth in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1268)|
| 0:21:20| If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| I was the outgoing chair through December 31, 2006, which is why I'm giving you this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| but any of us can answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you again for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| We appreciate all of your service a great deal, and thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| No, I just wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| You know, so many people in our community do so much that is so unknown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| and it's just a quiet obligation that you take upon yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| And I happen to be in the group, a large group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| who were all together with a lot of concerns prior to the Police Advisory Review Committee being formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1323)|
| 0:22:12| And having sat in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| and having been so concerned about how our community would resolve some issues and deal with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| I just have to say, because especially because of Carol, Scott, that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| and all of you who have been so willing to work on this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| that it is extraordinary how your service has blessed this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| and made it a wonderful place for us to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| And I know that probably our police chiefs would certainly say amen to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1361)|
| 0:22:49| because it has definitely brought a spirit of unity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| and understanding that we just could not achieve prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| I'm forming a, calling it the Tazewell Pike Beverly Road Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| It's going to be looking at potential road construction projects out in the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| and it's also going out into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| At least one member of the County Commission has agreed to help out and serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| City Engineering is participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| The Metropolitan, or Transportation Planning Organization is participating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| and I think TDOT is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| I'd like to have a fellow colleague of counsel join me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| We're going to start meeting the end of this month on a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| It's either October the 29th or 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| I don't recall correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| It's going to be at the Civic Auditorium Coliseum Ballroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| And the meeting is going to be at 730 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| We're trying to respect folks' work schedules so they don't take time out in the middle of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| If you are interested, I just kindly request that you contact our attorney, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| I'm going to have task force members put on next council's agenda as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1441)|
| 0:24:09| The second thing, totally different subject, but very serious subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| I was watching one of the local political shows Sunday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| It came on 9 or 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| And I almost hesitate bringing this up, and I am going to be cryptic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| and I am going to tap dance around it because none of the individuals involved in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| brought it up and made it public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| But another elected official talked about one of our colleagues on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| and what he had done regrettably in the past and what he had atoned for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| and compared it to a current situation with another person on another legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| and what they had regrettably done and atoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| There was an implication that this member of our council had kept that from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| that people didn't know about that situation, which was not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| It very much so was a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| While that person was running the first time in office, the voters certainly knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| There were newspaper articles about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| There were interviews on television about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| The public certainly knew about it, and the public accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Every time he appeared on the ballot, four times, he was the winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| That, unfortunately, wasn't the case with the other person in the other body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| I don't mean to step on any toes here, but when someone was sideswiped like that in a very public manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1526)|
| 0:25:34| when it wasn't true, I thought I might take a partially attempt to address that in a public manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Well, I guess, first of all, thank you for watching the shows and finding out stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| I had not heard that, and I'm glad to know you're watching out for us, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| I wanted to actually take a second on stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| and I know a lot is moving now with the county's new stormwater ordinance and our reaction to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1558)|
| 0:26:08| My understanding up until recently is that there's going to be a committee meeting to talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| and I wanted to ask a little about that, but I understand there have been some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| I was kind of looking forward to seeing what the county was going to be offering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| and I wanted to ask the mayor to let us know what is happening now on this and what the next steps are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Our plans are still, as we stated, to go forward with the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| and then the county will have 30 days to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| But in the meantime, as you know, we've said we're always open to talking and considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| We've had the committee set up, both county and city folks, set up to talk about that Friday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| But in the meantime, I'd encourage Steve King, who's our director of engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| to keep talking with the technical and engineering folks in the county to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| of these listed disagreements, are there things we can start to whittle down so that when this group gets together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| there's not quite this massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Let's just see if, you know, how many of these things can we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| if we sit down and focus on it, can we come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| And they met today and made considerable headway enough that it's my recommendation now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| that we postpone that Friday morning meeting or Friday, whenever it was, morning or afternoon, Friday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| And Steve feels like they're making some real headway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| and it's best right at this point in time to leave it in the technical people's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| I want to emphasize we're not changing our stance in terms of filing a lawsuit and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| But, again, it's always been our policy that if there's time to talk, we will keep talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| And this won't delay anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| And I feel comfortable with Steve and Brent pursuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| They've agreed with the county, have talked to Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| They agree that not meeting Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| and letting the technical people continue to talk is the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| So that's the latest update from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| But, obviously, welcome comments or questions from council folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| because I know it's important to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| Just to say, I hope we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| I trust Steve and Brent completely on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| And just hope we do stick to our guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| And while getting a resolution to this is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| it has to be something that works for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| And I know that's where you're at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Yeah, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| And no question, I mean, we could not agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| And, obviously, before, there will be nothing agreed to without coming back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| Rest assured of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| But, again, I think it's while these guys are making progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| I think we should let them make progress in getting to the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| But, again, we welcome your comments or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Well, I just feel that I must say that you and I have had a conversation about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| last evening, actually, at the graduation ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| And I feel pretty strongly about the city sticking to their guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| I think that's, unfortunately, a good way to phrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| And we have, those of us who have been on council for six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| have kind of had those guns in our holsters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| trying to keep our hands off them for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| And it hasn't been an easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| And so I just wanted to express, again, my strong feeling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| simply because I hear so much from my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| and I think from another part of the city, even more so, I hear those comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| that I think it's important for the city to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| The agreement was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| The agreement has not been adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| And you know my feelings on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| So I appreciate you letting me comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| We will obviously keep you apprised on the status of everything as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| 9B, an ordinance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| With council's permission, I just realized I forgot to announce something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| If you would let me rewind real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Sorry, we had so many special announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| One of the things I want to announce is the Tennessee Parks and Recreation Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| is honoring the city of Knoxville with two awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| These are awards that the four big cities in Tennessee compete for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| And I think there's four major awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| They give several awards, but there's four big ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| And I'm proud to say that we actually won two of those this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| with special programs from Parks and Rec, which speaks a lot to what a great job they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| One is for the Best Renovated Facility for Lonsdale Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| And a lot of you all were there when we reopened or kind of rechristened that about a month or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| And the second is for Best New Program, which is our Power U Healthy Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| The city of Knoxville, UT, Ag Extension, Knox County Health Department developed Power U Health jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| It's basically aimed at reducing childhood obesity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| And I got to be a part of it out at Victor Ashe Park back spring or something sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| I can't remember, Sam, when was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| But it really was very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| It was for children six to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| It was in seven of our rec centers last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| And we expanded it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| And it's now part of our after school program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| We've won these TRPA awards before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| But to win two of their four star awards is very special because they're the big ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| So, quite frankly, hats are off to Joe Walsh and to Sam Anderson and the other folks in Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| That says a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| One other interesting note is the whole Lonsdale deal was one of those great teamwork deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| It had engineering, public service, community development was a big piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| So, that's a great story in terms of what happened in Lonsdale and being awarded for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| So, thanks to all those department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Like I said, we compete with Chattanooga, Nashville, and Memphis for those awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| So, I think it speaks volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Now I've remembered most of what I'm supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 24, Article 1, Section 24-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| to alter the incentives for early payment of ad valorem real property taxes for the tax period beginning January 1, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1900)|
| 0:31:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| I had a conversation with Mr. York in the Finance Department about this this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| I assumed two weeks ago when we approved this on first reading that we would then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| I falsely assumed that we would then postpone this until we knew we had the money in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| This is a response to, as all of you know, Representative Campfield's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| that monies that were set aside be used for taxpayer relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| However, at the last, and Mr. Martin, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| but I don't believe the State Comptroller's Office has made a final decision on those grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| And I realized when I received my property tax bill in the mail between last meeting and this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| that obviously we had to go to print with our tax bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| And so, we had to go ahead and make a decision on this with or without the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| My understanding from Mr. York is that if the City of Knoxville has not awarded this grant from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| for taxpayer relief that this will cost us about $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| As Mr. York said to me this afternoon, the horse is out of the barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| I mean, the tax bills have been mailed for those folks and mortgage companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| that choose to pay the taxes in October and receive an additional discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| We'll have to absorb that cost if we don't receive this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| So, I just think everybody needs to know that's what's going on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| That's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Any further comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=1996)|

| 0:34:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Yeah, I have some problems with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| The Lower Second Creek Greenway is getting to be a little bit like Old Callaghan Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| When I see it, I get a little hot under the collar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| We're doing what feels like a very expensive greenway here, an expensive maintenance contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| and now we're putting in security cameras and emergency phones that I don't think exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| on any other greenways, and I almost think this money could be better spent building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| more greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| So I think I'm going to vote against this just to let people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| I think there's better use for the money than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| Steve, do you want to comment on anything on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Councilman Hawkins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Well, I think Councilman Becker's point is well made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| I think maybe the difference is, and I don't know if it's a justifiable difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| but I think that maybe a distinction can be made, maybe it can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| that this is essentially a linkage, a park linkage between the World's Fair Park and Volunteer Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| two sort of intensive parks both managed by PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| I think, I'm not sure if Volunteer Landing has security cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Does it have security cameras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| It does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| I hadn't noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| I hadn't paid that much attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| But so it's sort of, it's a greenway, and yet it's more than a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| And I don't know if that's justification for this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| I'm not arguing that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| But I think that there is some distinction to be made there, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| On the flip side, your point is well made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| What are we doing for our other greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Are we making any attempt to provide additional security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| Is that security actually necessary here or on other greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| I think that's another question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| I think we've found that our greenways are very secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| So that's another important point of discussion, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| as to whether or not this level of security is necessary on any, quote, greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| And if it's a park, then that's a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Perhaps if it's something like the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Anyway, I don't know that I have anything more to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| I just, I'm sort of agreeing with you, Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| but also trying to kind of put everything out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Councilman Becker, I had questions about this as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| and called Mr. King this afternoon, and I found out that there are security cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| and perhaps phones, I'm not sure about the phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| in the World's Fair Park and Volunteer Landing already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I guess what's regrettable to me is that the total cost of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| has become much, much higher than any other greenway we've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| And I know there have been engineering challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| with the slope and the railroad that have cost some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| but this is one of those cases where I wish I had known going into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| what it was going to cost us on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| And that can't always be accurately predicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| I will support this, but this is one expensive greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| Yeah, and I think, oh, excuse me, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| I was just going to say I appreciate the comments of my fellow council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| and understand wholeheartedly their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| I hope this actually is an opportunity for us to explore the possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| of other areas and other greenways that may need to have phones put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| or even cameras in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| I know I'm talking about spending more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| but the issue about safety is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| At one time, it was safe to leave the doors of our houses open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| until people started coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| And we don't want to wait until something happens and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| oops, now our greenways are not safe and now maybe we need to put in a phone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| We have a lot of female joggers, a lot of young folks that use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| So, actually, I hope this may be an opportunity to, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| explore the possibility of continuing to make all of our greenways and parks safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I guess just in reaction to everything, I appreciate the idea of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| well, let's think about doing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| I would be very shocked, Mr. Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| if in my continued tenure in this council we get any more security cameras on our greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| It's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I also feel like my understanding of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| and if the chief down there might correct me on law enforcement things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| is the theory is always that crowded areas are actually safer than areas that aren't crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| And I think this is going to be one of our most crowded greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| So I think if we can put cameras on a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| this would not actually be the place to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| because I think we're going to have people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| we're going to have the live eyes that are going to keep it safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| So, I just, this doesn't feel like a good use of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| Councilwoman Pelham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Well, I understand Mr. Becker's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| and you certainly cannot argue that this seems to be a preferential treatment of this particular greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| But I have to also agree with other council members who have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| This is a very, I think the location, the linkage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| and what we're attempting to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| It's a high tourist area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| It's an area of high profile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| and I think we're trying to promote that area as a kind of a destination for families in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| but also for families who come into the city and want to experience some place to jog or run and play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2366)|
| 0:39:35| and experience the park and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| You know, as to the other greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| in the years I've been on council and the years prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| there have been little situations which did bring to question whether security was adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| But we have been very, very fortunate that it appears that there's a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| there are a lot of eyes on those greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| and I really appreciate the Recreation Department and the Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| for how they've responded to any situations that have developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| It'd just be my hope that we don't ever need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| But when I spoke with Mr. King today, I did comment, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| in the future we may have to give consideration to other greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| that are in areas where it seems to draw attention to the opportunity for problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| And one would hope not, but I do support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| because I do support that agreement with VBA to manage this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| and I believe in their wisdom they feel this is necessary for them to be able to accept that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you. Mr. Hawkes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Following up on Councilman Pillow's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| the World's Fair Park and volunteer landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| I think it may be what we're looking at here is going beyond pure safety issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| to sort of a higher level of maintenance of order issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| If that's the proper term, that's a term that police officers use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| But we're worried about attracting certain people and not attracting other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| not having large clusters of homeless people congregating, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| I think maybe that's part of what we're looking at here, just to be very blunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| And whether you argue that that's legitimate or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| that's certainly been the approach on the World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| and I guess in volunteer landing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| And because of the large numbers of people that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| there are potential conflicts if it's not well managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| And I think what we're seeing is an integration of the management of those two other facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| and this link between the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| And a follow-up comment to Ms. Roddy's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| It's a fair thing if we'd have known before we began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Unfortunately, you don't always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| And I think it is worth noting that this is not just a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| It is involved stabilizing that bank, as you referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| and also a large part of the parking area for the UT parking lot that had to be tied into all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| So this was a little different case, but your point's very well made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Is there any harm in a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| I know a lot of people like to just get on with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| but a lot of these comments and questions and observations, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| lead to sort of, to me, what are our long-term plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| and sort of the justification and rationale and criteria and just sort of curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2541)|
| 0:42:29| In terms of security, is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Well, again, personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| I don't know it's realistic that we're going to have cameras and phones on every, you know, mile of greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| I understand that, but I just think this sort of begs a number of questions from my standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| I was just curious if there's any harm in a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| I think the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| I'll let you comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Well, I think if that's what council desires, I think that could be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| But it might be beneficial, and Mr. Wetzel came down maybe to help to give a little bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| The city contacted PBA about the maintenance of this greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| since it tied into Volunteer Landing and World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| And when they indicated to us that they felt like we'd need to install cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| and we did include the conduit in the greenway project for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| And, as a matter of fact, we made a request in the current budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| and it was approved in the CIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| I think it's listed as Second Creek Greenway Cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| So this has been something that we have had some discussion on in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| If you feel like you need more information, then we'd be happy to try to provide that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Well, really, what I wanted to do was to hear what you had to say just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| when earlier you didn't have a comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| And I just thought, well, I would really like to hear those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Councilman Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Keep in mind that this is a capital appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| The conduit, as Steve said, has already been laid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| and it's set up for mounting the cameras on street on light poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| And PBA is just going to pull the cable and mount the cameras and that sort of thing for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| And the actual operation and maintenance of this system is separate from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| This comes under PBA's management contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| So this is already set up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| It's already plumbed and wired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| So it's not wired, but it's set up to wire and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| So we're a long ways down the greenway, so to speak, on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| And we've got, plus we've already got this other contract with PBA to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| So, you know, that's, I think we're pretty heavily committed in one sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| You know, when I'm sitting up here, not everybody is privy to the information that some of us are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| And so when the public's listening to this and we just really don't have any sort of this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| and there's no response, that's why I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| So this all helps a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| I heard seven ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all forms necessary to file an application to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| Tennessee Department of Transportation Industrial Highway Access Program for funding to design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| and construct an industrial highway for the Scripps Television Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| And if such application is approved, to authorize the mayor to execute any and all documents to accept such a grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Mr. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Well, in talking to Mr. King earlier, he said that this would have to come back to council again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| And based on the language, I'm not sure that that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| I think his comment was if there's any city money spent, it would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| Yeah, I think that's what we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| So at this point, we don't know if the city is obligated for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| We're obviously hoping not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| Anything that we did, we would bring back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Right now, we're going to the state to get a grant and see where that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| The understanding, as long as council understands it, it could come back to us with the request that we put city dollars into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2778)|
| 0:46:28| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Just to remind you, Councilman Hook, was that this is one of those opportunities I believe we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| And, frankly, hearing, being able to be present for the announcement that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| and the excitement that Scripps has about the expansion in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| and the great promise that it has for Knoxville in terms of 200 executive level jobs coming into the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2805)|
| 0:46:54| Scripps deciding to make this their big national presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| It's pretty exciting for Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| And it was very exciting for the employees who work there presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| So I feel that this is just a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| I think it's another proof of the pudding that Knoxville is really getting on the map in a very wonderful way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| that will be known by a number of people and maybe a sort of a magnet to bring some other folks to a larger presence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2839)|
| 0:47:28| So I think this is a good investment if we have to make one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| But it certainly is, I think, the gesture we need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| And the governor was there and just as equally excited about this opportunity for Knoxville and for Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| And I have to really congratulate the mayor on all of the negotiations that it took to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Okay, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=2870)|

| 0:50:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Mr. Wetzel, in all bold print in this information sheet and in the contract, it indicates that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| the contractor is not going to deal with hazardous waste, which begs the question for me then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| if there is hazardous materials, who is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| Will we see a separate contract for that or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| The contract we have going out tonight will have environmental oversight, but the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| we're hiring will merely take care of the vegetation and the trash that's on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| If they run into environmental issues, we'll have to deal with that on the next round of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| I guess my greatest concern is they have the expertise to recognize if a material would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| need special handling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| We've made special precautions to get that into the contract to make sure we have a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| out there doing that oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| And that won't leave the site until we have the appropriate people to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I don't know who would want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| Maybe Mr. Wetzel, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| But in terms of the site itself, the status of the site, where we're expecting to go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| this, obviously cleaning the site up is preparing it for marketability, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3078)|
| 0:51:26| I'd just like to get a little background on that if somebody would like to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| I will, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| It is basically preparing it to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Obviously, we're hoping with the sale of the property, you know, to the exit north of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| where Cisco's going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| We put that money back in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| And it's doing two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| One, it's cleaning up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Second, we've had some issues with homeless camps and other things back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| So it's preparing it for market and hopefully addressing other situations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| And the bid did come in a little lower than we were expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| Obviously, we'll still wait to see the final number if there's environmental concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| But it is lower than what we had in the budget that you all approved last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3126)|

| 0:52:42| Well, this is one that I believe came back to us, did it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| And, Mr. Kaiser, can you explain why it came back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| When we vote on something more than once, I usually like to know why we're doing it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| The state wanted some additional terms in addition to those that were in the contract we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| They're primarily sections D.31 through D.34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| The one that is the reason I wanted you to take another look at this is because of D.32| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| pertaining to third-party liability, which provides that the city will assume all liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| for third-party claims and damages arising from the construction, maintenance, existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| and use of the project to the extent of the limits of the Governmental Tort Liability Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| That was a liability that was not set forth in the prior agreement that you approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| I wanted to make sure that it appeared before Council again for its consideration of that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3213)|

| 0:54:53| So, and I really don't know enough about it to speak intelligently about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| When they explained it to me, it sounded like a great thing, but I was highly distracted after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| and don't remember everything I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| I apologize, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| But it sounds like a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| 12A is an emergency ordinance to extend for an additional 15 days the moratorium upon the issuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| of building permits for exterior construction in the Edgewood Park neighborhood as adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| in Ordinance No. 0-209-07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| Requested by Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| I want to just say I know on a number of occasions I've said I actually think I'm smarter than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| every other individual on Council, but I'm nowhere near smarter than all nine of us put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| Can we vote on that first one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| And this, I think, is a really good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| I think when I first brought forward a 60-day moratorium, I thought that was a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| And Councilman's wisdom said we should do this in 15-day increments because that gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| us a lot more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| And that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| There's some wonderful opportunities now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| I'm counting on the wisdom of Council to continue on this because with those opportunities become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| options which are not always quite as clear as we'd like them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| There actually is a fellow who's trying to build a house in the area of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| Met him at the meeting we had on the overlay last week and actually has a plan that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| fit, and we've actually had that reviewed by the infill housing staff and figure it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| And there are ways we can modify this to let the house get built, which I think I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| to recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| There are some concerns that there would be no requirements that he actually build what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| So I think I'd like to offer an amendment on this, but one council to think about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| other option would be this amendment or potentially waiting two weeks, and in two weeks, MPC will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| have adopted the infill housing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| And we probably at that point can put some teeth into allowing folks to build under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| Is that clear to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| The other option we have now is actually having a gap in the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| Say we're going to not pick up the moratorium for a day after the current one expires and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| allow people to apply then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| The other option is to wait two weeks and get a little more teeth in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| What's your preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Well, my preference was to have the my wisdom is to do the gap and get it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| But I do count on the wisdom, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| I'm concerned that there is no requirement that he build the house he showed us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| looks so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| So I want to open that up for sort of thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| Councilman Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Well, you say MPC is going to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| That would be, I believe, Mr. Donaldson, at the upcoming regular MPC meeting, which in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| turn would not come to this council for a few more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| So another two weeks wouldn't put those in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| So am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| There is a way to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| I'm listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| What we would say, and Mr. Swanson, correct me if I'm wrong on the theory of this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| we'd say there's a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| But if you voluntarily agreed to go by the standards that were adopted by MPC that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| clear and there, you can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| So it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| And the question is, do we have a formal place where those guidelines have been set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| You know, the place where they are, which we don't at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Where they're officially set by MPC and, therefore, they've been adopted by that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| Somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| And defined, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| And Mr. Swanson was nodding up and down, which I mean, he's okay with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| It sounds like that's an alternative to your preference, which is the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| And that strikes me as a sounder alternative if this individual can wait two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3545)|
| 0:59:13| I have no idea if the individual can wait two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| He would like to move quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Everybody building a house would like to move quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| So, again, my sense is I actually do trust this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| I haven't talked to him twice, but there are lots of people I trust that I probably shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| So I appreciate any wisdom council has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| Are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| I haven't yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| I was getting ready to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| Tell us what your motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| My motion would be to have the Section 3 change to say that an emergency exists, yada, yada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3583)|
| 0:59:52| This ordinance shall take effect on Friday, which would be October 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3592)|
| 1:00:01| So they would actually leave a one-day gap in the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| We keep passing 15-day moratoriums in council meetings every 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Have we passed so many 15-day moratoriums that there will be a gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| You're certain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Everyone's 15 days from the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| So some days there are two moratoriums in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| I just wanted to ask Councilman Becker, if he'd asked the builder, have you told him about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| And he's okay with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| The gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Yes, the gap works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| I actually haven't discussed the other alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| People raised some concerns with me about not having the guidelines after I talked to the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| That actually came up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| So I didn't get a chance to talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| Mr. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Ms. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| Excuse me, Ms. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| We'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| I think the current moratorium runs out tomorrow, which is the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| So if you want to put a gap in it for the 11th, then you would go back into effect on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| So I think you want this to go into effect on the 12th rather than the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Mr. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Mr. Becker, does the Neighborhood Association or their president have an opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3681)|
| 1:01:31| They're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| If they do, they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| They may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I'm not trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| I just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Have you talked to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| I have had conversations with the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| Is there a preference in the gap versus the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| We can, if they're willing to speak, we can ask Ms. Zavicka to address the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| Zavicka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Zavicka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| And we'll never get that one right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Ellen Zavicka, 3118 Fairview Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| I appreciate the pronunciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Personally, as the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| And let me preface this by saying I'm also a staff member at MPC, but I'm speaking as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| a representative of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| This is something that's been very contentious in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| And the process that the person who's seeking to develop this property has followed hasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| at all times, followed the city regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| So, you know, I have no reason to say that he's not trustworthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| At the same time, I think the option of waiting two weeks until MPC has approved the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3749)|
| 1:02:38| and maybe there's a little more teeth in it, as Councilmember Becker said, would be preferable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=3758)|

| 1:21:25| Well, some of my comments have been answered by Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Having remembered sitting through a very long discussion about this at the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| and it was an extended discussion, many questions, many comments, and many concerns, you know, expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| Mr. Newbert is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| I just spotted you back there in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| I just recall him speaking to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| And that seemed in some way to assist the MPC in coming to a conclusion about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| because it was quite a divided discussion initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| I don't know if Mr. Newbert would want to say anything, but he did speak on his behalf at NBC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| and I thought you might want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Ms. Newbert, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| It's just if you have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| It's just if you would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| I don't know Mr. Newbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| but I just recall him making a very good explanation of his needs and the situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| My name is Joe Newbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| I'm at 7207 Imperial Drive in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| I've been in business over 30 years, and this piece of property actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4959)|
| 1:22:47| the good Lord just had to work it out for me, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| I couldn't have bought it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| But it will become a part of my estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| And I have three sons and three body shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| And I'm not interested in doing anything but repairing automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| Not the strip that the gentleman was talking about, 30 or 40 feet wide, is actually a joint parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4984)|
| 1:23:12| It does encompass the entire shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| And I'm not interested in trying to put anything over there that looks bad or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| And I'm trying to really shape it up and make it look very pleasurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| I think Councilman Holquist had the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Well, going back to what Councilman Becker said about C6 not working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| and then what Mr. Donaldson said, which is if the new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| there would be extensive landscape requirements, et cetera, under C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| but that's not an issue with an existing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| I think that sheds a different light on it in relation to what you had said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| Since C6, I guess, was considered, we can amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5042)|
| 1:24:10| Plus, it's probably considered a less intensive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| But certainly since it was considered, it doesn't matter because we can amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| And I guess the big issue there for Mr. Newbert would be whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| or not it's going to slow him down because he called me earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| and said that, you know, he's under the gun to get out of his old location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| I also am concerned, and I share Councilman Roddy's concerns about the future of this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| because that zoning will outlive any of the present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| or potential future family members that might hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| I mean, I'm not saying it can remain in the same family for centuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| but on the other hand, if it's part of an estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| sometimes those do get sold when they're divided up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| So I don't think we know for sure that it will remain in the present use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| or the proposed body shop use forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| And so I would concur with Councilman Roddy's concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| So my tendency would be to want to give strong consideration to going with C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| Councilman Becker, then I'll come back to Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| I actually tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| In sitting in Mark's office, maybe I misunderstood Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| but the C6 requirements, the setbacks, the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| that would only come with a new development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| That's my understanding that unless we were talking about a major redevelopment of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| which would be ripping up the parking lot and starting over or reconfiguring the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| That's a piece I missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| We wouldn't have a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| Does the C6 limit some of the outdoor but allow some outdoor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| Does it allow, I guess, Mr. Newby, you're going to be doing the cars you're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| some of them will be outside, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| So is that my assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| I sort of thought that the staff didn't understand something when they did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| but perhaps they were smarter than I gave them credit for yesterday that C6 would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5173)|
| 1:26:22| We actually can display cars and store cars outside, just not in the required front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5182)|
| 1:26:31| which with this site we would have to make a call as to what the front yard is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| It would probably be Kermit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Well, it would be the front of the store, the southeast corner that's already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| Well, they've got street frontage on Kermit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| but they don't have street frontage on where the old retail front was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| So there may be some judgment involved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Essentially, we would require that the required front yard remain landscaped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5219)|
| 1:27:07| but they could store in other portions of the area between the building and the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5227)|
| 1:27:15| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| I think what I've heard from Mr. Donaldson is that the C6 does allow quite a bit of flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| on the part of the Planning Commission staff as each application is reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| and I guess I haven't heard compelling enough reasons to rezone this C4 in terms of the long-term impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| on the surrounding neighbors and on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| So I would like to move to amend to have this rezoning to C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Motion to second to make it C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Mr. Neuber, would you like to respond to some of these comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| Well, the problem that I was told at Metropolitan Planning Commission was that if we went C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5272)|
| 1:28:00| that I would have to put screening around the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| They have already broken in because of the undergrowth and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| I'm trying to clear all of that out, but they broke in and took all the copper out of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| to the tune of $78,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| And I have just numerous problems with customers parking their cars inside the fenced area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5296)|
| 1:28:25| yet even the police department came and asked me to move the cars away from the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| so that they could see the cars on the lot and see when people were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| Even though it's very well lit and everything, it still happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| And we were told at MPC that the screening was a requirement in C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5321)|
| 1:28:48| It was not a requirement in C4 and could be waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| That was my problem, being that the screening would have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| I could not have the same security that I would, you know, need with the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| and having to screen the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| Mr. Donaldson, you're saying that your understanding is C6 would require an opaque fence to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5350)|
| 1:29:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| Mr. Donaldson, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| While you're reading, I say it's one of the things that's interesting about C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| again from the conversation yesterday, is how many –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| I always think of C6 as there's a plan and a lot of flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| that there are a lot of very strict requirements that go with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| that make things like this much more of a challenge than they ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| I'm glad the question got raised because I would very much prefer this being C6 and C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| I just recall this very discussion at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| and it being somewhat of a deciding factor on resolving some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| because of the security issue for the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| And I believe the comments he had made about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| I quite honestly applied for C6 to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| And when I came to MPC and discussed it with the first person who had the file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5414)|
| 1:30:21| he was the one that told me I did not need to go with C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| that it had so strict requirements that I couldn't operate the business properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| and I'd have to put the screening around the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| and everything that I needed to change it to C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| And that was exactly what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| I accepted his wisdom and did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| Then they came back and changed the file, gave it to someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| and that person, I understand, decided that I needed C6 instead of C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| I don't know who's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Mr. Donaldson, I see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Mark, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| The only reference to outdoor storage and display in C6 is, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| it starts with an outright prohibition on outdoor storage facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| And then it exempts that to exclude the outdoor display of new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5474)|
| 1:31:20| and used automobile sales vehicles for sale or rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| or the incidental display of goods or chattels for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| or rent in a commercial development by an establishment having activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| that occur principally within a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| And then it says, however, if outdoor display is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| it cannot be within the required front yard, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| a 35-foot required yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| I don't see any provision in here that says that vehicles waiting to be worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5511)|
| 1:31:59| have to be stored behind a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| That may have been in C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| From reading the minutes, it sounded like Mr. Newbert wanted to fence in a certain part of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| the area between the building and Kermit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| Which would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| That is the furthest part away from the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| And it would not be visible at all from the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| That was the reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| So the ordinance speaks to goods for sale or rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| It doesn't speak to vehicles waiting to be worked upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5558)|
| 1:32:46| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| Well, Council, this is first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| and it looks like there are some issues that can be clarified between first and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| My tendency is to approve this as amended on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| with the understanding that, if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| we can still go back to the original version, which is C4, should that be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5585)|
| 1:33:12| But I think, surely, whatever clarification remains to be made in terms of front yard definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| fencing and screening, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| Mr. Donaldson could bring us definitive answers in terms of what the MPC will do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| what the staff will do with C6 by the next reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| And so if we approve it on first reading as C6, then we can adjust that if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| Councilman Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| Yeah, I sat down with Mr. Newbert and talked through this whole process that he's been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| and his intent to try to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| And I'm also aware that he has some circumstances around his business transaction that he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| He was asking me for an avenue to approve this, you know, through an emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| which I was prepared to support and am prepared to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| So that sort of adds a new little, you know, kink in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| Let me explain my problem to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| The north shop location is located at Reeder Chevrolet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| They sold Reeder Chevrolet three years ago, and my lease actually ran out August of 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5657)|
| 1:34:26| and I have no place else to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| If I wait any longer without starting the construction to change that location to a body shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5669)|
| 1:34:36| I'm not going to be out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| I'll have 13 people wanting their money and won't be able to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5679)|
| 1:34:46| and won't have any place to operate the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| And it's quite an unusual circumstance because the fellow that bought the dealership actually is from Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5689)|
| 1:34:59| They really did like the way we were operating the body shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| but they needed the space to move their truck parts and trucks in, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| Well, having, you know, heard all this arguments and discussions and so forth, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| and what Mrs. Pelo referred to earlier is the long and lengthy discussion at the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| and the sort of conclusion that they came to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| I'm going to support Mr. Newbert because I do think all along he's trying to do the best thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| and even for the surrounding neighborhoods and the center and the improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| So I'm going to support him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| I don't know whose light was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| I think maybe Councilman Beckers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| Yeah, I actually think Mr. Newbert is going to do a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| and I'd like to see this actually done quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| I'm not a fan of emergency ordinances, but it can always be tying my shoe down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| That tends to happen way too often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| I was actually going to make a little suggestion about process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| Mr. Donaldson still seems to be reading things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| and I'd actually like to ask Mr. Swanson to join him in sort of seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| because I think we all want to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| We've got to figure out what to do this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| I was going to ask Mr. Swanson to do a little reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| and actually suggest that we hold this off until the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| Actually, I'm going to go to, if you don't mind, I'm going to go to Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| I think he might have a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| I won't take credit for it, but we could pass this C6 on an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| and investigate in the meantime and bring it up at the very next Council meeting with a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5776)|
| 1:36:23| Will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Will that allow me to go ahead and get my permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| I guess I have a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| Go ahead, Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| I was just going to, because I was aware of the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| I just became aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| And because I had sat through this long discussion prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| And what concerns me is if he goes on with it, he may not meet the code for a C4 or C6, excuse me, C6, if we put it off two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5803)|
| 1:37:01| I mean, you've got to move by when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| I have to be out of the building by the end of November, and I've got a lot of construction to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5824)|
| 1:37:11| And if I don't get started on it within the next few days, I'm not going to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| And I don't know why I find myself advocating for this, but I just listened to it for so long that I feel that he does want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5836)|
| 1:37:23| And, you know, I just think we're all in a terrible situation with time and some issues that we can't really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5843)|
| 1:37:31| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| I think it's a great solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Whoever thought of it over there in that corner is deserving of praise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| And it feels like if there is a kink, we'll know that in the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| But should be able to at least get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| I'll amend my amendment to C6 on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| I'm in the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Now, the motion to amend is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| Can I combine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| You can lump them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| I'm going to combine them with your permission to C6 and emergency is the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5877)|
| 1:38:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| Discussion to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| Ms. Pilo, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Oh, I forgot to turn the light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| But I'll just, you know, I'll just think out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| I don't know how I'd feel about that if I were Mr. Newbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Because we are leaving this thing quite up in the air for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| And he's going to go ahead and begin to invest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| And then we're sitting here saying, gee whiz, we may just flip that rug on you here in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5907)|
| 1:38:34| You know, I think that's just really disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| Ms. Pilo, I think the answer to that question is you're only going to flip the rug on him if he asks you to flip the rug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5916)|
| 1:38:43| That's the only time you're going to flip the rug here is if he discovers for some reason C6 doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| and then that he needs C4 and then he comes back and asks you to change it to C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| and you move to reconsider to put it at C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| That's the only reason you would ever do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| So it has to be at his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| So it takes care of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| It has to be at his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Councilman Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| It doesn't have to be, but as I understand what you're saying tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| that's the only reason you're going to do it is what I'm hearing a consensus of the council saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5949)|
| 1:39:15| No, I guess I wasn't feeling that's what I was hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| Unlike you, Mr. Becker, I'm feeling now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| That scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| How do you feel about it, Mr. Newbert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I don't believe the C6 will work, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| I cannot put the screening around the fence and protect the automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| And the gentleman that helped me at MPC did read that particular part to me in C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5977)|
| 1:39:45| and said, this, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| And I had the police department even come, like I say, to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| you cannot believe the numerous damage that we have had to automobiles from, even without that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=5992)|
| 1:40:00| two of the shops I have now do not have the screening because it's grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6000)|
| 1:40:06| So we have moved all the vehicles away from the fence in order to keep, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| the security better, and it has improved, but it still hasn't stopped, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6011)|
| 1:40:19| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Two thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| I appreciate you, and I think everybody here wants you to do what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| and we're trying to figure out the way that does that the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| It's interesting, you've got a fellow at MPC who says you can't do the screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| and we've got one who says you can, and I think he's the boss of your guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| So I think we've got a little weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| The other thing, I'd actually like to suggest the process that we do break the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| into two different ones because I would hate for us to not pass this on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| so if the sponsor is willing to do two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| If the amendment fails, then the original is on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| and that could be amended to emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Ms. Roddy, what would you like to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| I concur with Councilman Hallquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| If the amendment on the floor fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| then we can always amend the original motion just as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| So you want right now that the one motion is to vote on amending the C-6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| C-6 plus emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| C-6 and an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| The motion on the floor is to amend to C-6 on emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| And I think that was seconded by Councilman Hallquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| Did I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| We better count those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Councilman Hallquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| It's 4-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| We're back on the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Now we're back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| I would remind people that an emergency ordinance does take six votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| and there are only eight people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| Right now we don't even have a motion to amend to emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| We just have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| We have a motion to approve right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| We'll do a roll call real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| This is a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| The original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Which would be on first reading only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| First reading only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| He needs it as the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| It has to be amended now to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| I guess there is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| I mean, your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| So Mr. Swanson, I need to amend it now for emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| or can we vote to approve it and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| The better form is to amend it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| I'm trying to be strategical here, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| Is there a motion to amend to emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| There's a second from Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| All those in favor of amending to emergency, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| We'll do a roll call real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| I think I heard three, but let's make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| It needs six and it had five, if I counted that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| Fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Actually, you can amend it with five votes, but then it takes six to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| That's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| So I guess technically now that motion is amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| To an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| Now we'll vote, but it will need six to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| Let me mention to you, if you don't pass it, you're putting 14 people out of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Until I'm able to get it finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| Now, if five people vote to pass this, then it will have not passed on emergency, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6263)|
| 1:44:33| As I understand it, if five people vote for it, it will pass not on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| I'm going to say, I mean, Mr. Neuber, I think I spoke in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| I got that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| I got that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Because you've amended it to emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| The only way it can pass right now is with six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| It can only pass with six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| If not, it's back to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| If you don't have six votes, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| We're back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| Is everybody with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| He would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| He wouldn't have to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| He wouldn't have to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| It would go back to being voted on at two separate meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| It's now amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Because you've amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| You moved to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| Right now, the motion on the floor is amended to pass on emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| But to pass that, it takes six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| So if it doesn't pass, right now you're back at square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| Square one meaning we're where we are ten minutes ago or where we were eight weeks ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| It would fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| It would fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| And when it fails, then it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| Unless you reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| I'm going to pass for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| Councilman Hopkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| If it fails, then someone can make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| That will take six votes to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| Actually, not at the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| At the same meeting, it only takes five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| It will only take five votes to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| Then it's open to a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| And council members can figure out what might pass, what might garner the votes to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| based on what we've already seen in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| I guess I want to say to Mr. Newbert, I know this is confusing and it's confusing all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| My belief is I want to see you move forward in the way you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| I believe, from what I've heard tonight, that it can be done at C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| And I think that's a much better zoning for that property than C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| So, at the moment, I'm going to be voting against you, but we still want the same thing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| We're just working on details and aggravating you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Well, I'm pretty certain I just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| I was wanting to ask the concerns of the district-specific representative on this issue and preferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6406)|
| 1:46:55| C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell to call the roll then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Remember, it needs six to pass at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| Councilman Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| Mr. Becker, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| All I was going to do is just ask the district representative if he could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| just to be specific what his opposition to this is, just specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| My specific opposition is we have a challenge with our zoning ordinance in C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| And C4 is a fairly limited zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| Because it's a limited zone, I'd say 80 percent of the C4 zones end up being used car lots at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| This is a horrible place for a used car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| And I know Mr. Newbert isn't going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| I don't think it's going to happen in the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| But I'm going to be here 25 years from now, and I don't want to see a used car lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| But not on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| Well, I won't be on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| I won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| And I think it can be done on C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| And I don't think C6 results in used car lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| So that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| I believe C6 includes the used car lot too, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| It could be a used car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| The interesting thing, the challenge becomes, because C4 is so limited, they become, there's so few of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| they become, you need a used car lot, you've got to find a C4, as opposed to C6, which can be a lot broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6495)|
| 1:48:22| You've got a lot more opportunity to put them in the places they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| I'm having a thought that my neighbor doesn't approve of, but I'm going to share it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| Just looking at the map, and we didn't discuss this, by the way, but in looking at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6517)|
| 1:48:47| you know, this thing is ringed with C4, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6527)|
| 1:48:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| Ms. Mitchell, if you'd call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| And I apologize for standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| I've got a bad back and I'm about to wear out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Ms. Mitchell, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| Would someone like a motion to move to reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Move to reconsider is added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| Mr. Becker, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| That was a move to reconsider, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| There has to be five, just five to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| All those in favor of reconsidering, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| It's reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| I think the only way we're going to get votes to pass something is Mr. Frost's idea, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6586)|
| 1:49:53| if I recall, is C6 emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| I believe that will work and it gives us the opportunity, if it doesn't, to come back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| a couple of weeks and change it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| C4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| C4 won't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| We've just proved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| On emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| I just want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Well, I'm going to go ahead and make a motion to do this C6 on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| First, we need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| We're back to ground zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| We've got to start with a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| Now a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| C6 on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| There's a motion and a second to amend a C6 on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Councilman Frost, I'm going to go to next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| Then I'll come to Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| Mr. Newbert, in the event that this passes and, you know, you, in case you receive confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6644)|
| 1:50:53| that C6 will not work, you would need to contact Councilman Bailey before noon Wednesday of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6653)|
| 1:51:00| next week to get this put on the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Will this allow me to get permits to get started on construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| That's what I need so desperately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| It will be effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Councilman Bailey is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| And then I'm going to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| I was going to say, basically, with the 4-4 vote earlier, it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| And then we had to add the motion, the emergency motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| I mean, nothing passed in 4-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| Nothing's passed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| I mean, we didn't vote on it earlier with a 4-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| 4-4 is a failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| I have five votes to pass something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| Mr. Becker now, and then I'll go to Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| I just, to cover all the bases, I'd like this put on the agenda for two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| I mean, to a degree, that gives you up until a week, two weeks from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| to figure out if it's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| So let's cover all the bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| I just want to make sure that I'm clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Didn't we just vote on this a few minutes ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| We're back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| We're re-fishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| Councilman Hucklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| Again, Mr. Donaldson, who oversees all the staff that is responsible for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| has said to this council tonight what sounds like exactly what Mr. Newbert wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| not what somebody working under Mr. Donaldson has told Mr. Newbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| but what Mr. Donaldson himself has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| And so I see that as being the proverbial horse's mouth and no offense intended, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6759)|
| 1:52:49| but I think that the opportunity is here to get it right and to do what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| based on what he said, to allow Mr. Newbert to do what he wants to under C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Mr. Donaldson, because I note that I think he continues to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| state once again where you are, you know, based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| I'm back to reading the minutes where we recommended C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| I see you still reading, and I think it's not fair sometimes to put you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| or even administrative staff sometimes on the spot for a quick answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| read something, one paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| and tell us right now that we hang our heads on it as law and the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| So I want you to tell me you've had about ten minutes of watching us chase ourselves here to do a little more reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| Tell me what your opinion is with regards to the salient issue before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| and that is whether or not this gentleman can do this under C-6 without having to put up the screening he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| My senior zoning administrator recommended C-6, thinking that it would work for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6824)|
| 1:53:53| I suspect that it comes down to some sort of interpretation about the term storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6833)|
| 1:53:59| and display of goods and chattels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| I can't speak for codes administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| They could opine differently, and we quite often have in-house discussions about how you interpret the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6849)|
| 1:54:21| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| I guess one of the advantages, if it comes down to a question of screening and outside storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| you definitely can begin work right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| That's probably not a question that's going to come up right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| And I think this gives us that opportunity to look at it again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| And right now I don't see anything else that is going to pass this council that allows him to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| and gives us the opportunity to reconsider it right away, which we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| My only concern is, and in order to allow this gentleman, Mr. Newberry, to get started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| about maybe to be convinced to go ahead and do what's been suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| My only concern is, and we talk about if it doesn't work, he can come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| The implication there is when he comes back, we're going to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| And everybody here who's really against this C4 has to understand the implication we're saying to this gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6909)|
| 1:55:15| who's about to spend monies, spend dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| And if he turns around and comes back, and then we say we're still not going to let you have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| because he spent dollars and has moved forward based on this implied statement that we're putting out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| that we're going to give you a chance to come back and we'll fix this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| we're going to have a big problem on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| We just need to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| I think that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| I was just thinking about trying to come up with a way to help everybody out through this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| I recall what we did with the Doan Market off of Cecil and Cherry Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| where we gave Mr. Doan the zoning he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| And then on his word, he came back the very next day to MPC and downzoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| where his use became grandfathered for his use and his use alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| And then the zoning that was really probably the better for the situation was passed by council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6964)|
| 1:56:12| because Mr. Doan came back through MPC and came back to council and kept his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| That might be a route to consider this go-around as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6977)|
| 1:56:24| But, you know, if we're able to, if Mr. Newbert is able to get what he wants under C-6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6984)|
| 1:56:31| and we do it on an emergency, it might work out or he might be back here in two weeks' time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| since it's going to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| Mr. Newbert, do you understand a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| I shot a lot at you all at once, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| Let's say we pass this tonight on emergency on C-6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| and folks in the city hunker down and figure out what we can or you can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| And let's assume it doesn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| And we bring this back for reconsideration for this small segment of the property to be rezoned to a C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7020)|
| 1:57:08| Would you be willing to come back and apply to change it back to C-6 where your C-4 use would be grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7028)|
| 1:57:16| Yes, sir, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| The only problem I have with C-6, honestly, is the screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| If I don't have, if the screening is not going to be enforced like the C-6 says, I have no problem with it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7042)|
| 1:57:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| Mr. Holquist, real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| I want to actually respond to the Vice Mayor's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| I'm absolutely committed that if this comes back and doesn't work as C-6 to go with C-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| I came into this meeting from, I guess, a misunderstanding from talking to Mr. Donaldson that C-6 wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| And I was willing to go with C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| And, quite frankly, I was willing to stare at my shoes during an emergency ordinance on a C-4, which I don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| So I'm committed to doing it if it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071009?start=7079)|
