| 0:05:42| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| We have an application on our agenda today for nays and jays drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| So could you just kind of tell me what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| As you can see, I have a grandbaby, and I can't really be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| I've sent these employees, you know, to training classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| I don't want to do this anymore, and I'd like to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| A friend of mine is wanting to buy it, so I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| I got her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| She's more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| I'm just wondering, did they just not look at the ID or just disregard it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| You know, this girl is the same one that sold the first time, and I sent her to a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| I got a register that you programmed the birth date into, but, you know, I mean, I live on this side of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| It's on that side of the river, and I can't be there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| So if you can't send them to a training class and get them taught, I just don't want to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| So is she still employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Because you said this was the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| No, she's fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| I mean, I don't know what else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| This girl used to be a Knox County police officer, and I thought, you know, she would know to ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| As far as being a Knox County officer, I think she worked at detention for juvenile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=423)|
| 0:07:12| Commissioner Fondas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| This is noted as a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| When did the first offense occur, or the last offense prior to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| I believe it was April of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Our records reflect that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Commissioner Saunders, I think your first question would have been accurate also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| because this is not just the second time at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| We've consistently had problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| And, Mr. May, Officer May, was this the case where the underage drove the police car through the drive-through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=471)|
| 0:08:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Not on this particular one we're talking about today, but they did the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| But when you drive a county car through a drive-through and buy beer, you know, that's not being very responsible to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=490)|
| 0:08:21| Who's going to be running this place now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| The same man that owns Daniel's Bar and Grill at the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| You know, I have a real problem, and I think a couple of others up here do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| have a real problem even with these drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| And, quite frankly, I'd like to see them all closed down because I don't know what the percentages are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| but I think Officer May would verify the fact that the biggest part of the problems we have selling underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| are from drive-throughs, and there's not that many of them in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| So it is a definite problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| I'm not so sure that, well, I know we've got to do that on the second step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| and I'll save my comments about the application then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Please commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| I'm Steve Schopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I represent Ronnie Romines, and he has filed an application to transfer that beer permit to his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| He owns Daniel's Bar and Grill and has been in business there for several years and has no violations on his record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| He knows what he's doing and has been in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| And we'd ask that you approve that transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| Point of order, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| I just want to be detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| I know this is an attorney, but he didn't stand up to swear in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| He doesn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Our courts have asserted that the attorney is already an officer of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| It's superfluous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| You wouldn't want to swear a lawyer anyway, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| Although we should make an exception probably for this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| That's all right, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| I asked the same question over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| When do you expect to close on the sale of this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| As soon as this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| We're in the process of trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Technically, it's not a transfer of a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| It's actually a brand-new license, is it not, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Essentially, you'll have to surrender the old permit and you'll get a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| I think what the attorney is referring to is the state law that reads, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| if a license was previously active there, unless there's any mitigating circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| that a new permit would be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| Well, given the circumstances, Mr. Law Director, if she's going to sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| even if we revoke her license today or if we were to give her the $1,000 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| which is what we normally do on a second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| I don't see a compelling reason to make her pay it because if we revoke it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| she's sold it and the new applicant has a very good chance of getting a new license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| I'm just wondering what can we do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Well, Commissioner, again, I'll defer to the Board's wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| but generally your policies and procedures were enacted as a deterrent effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| And, obviously, this is one of those oddities of the cases where you're not going to achieve that goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| because she's, in fact, decided to surrender the livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| So the Commission need not take action at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| and can just allow the transfer to go through and not penalize the soon-to-be previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| But that's certainly your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| If we were to fine her, would this follow the business or does it only go with the license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| which, in other words, would not go to the new owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| No, it would remain with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| It would remain with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Yeah, the fine does not travel with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| And, besides, you don't have a new owner yet, so you couldn't fine someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| What we could go ahead just for procedural is to, in case the sale does not go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| we could put in a fine and she doesn't pay it and it sells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| You can assess a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| That's her choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| You can assess a fine, suspend the fine upon transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| and if the transfer, for some reason, doesn't go through and she retains ownership, then you can enforce the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| It's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| This question is for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Could we impose the fine and legally, I guess is my question, can we impose the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=755)|
| 0:12:43| and then when the transaction occurs, which I don't think the transaction can occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| beer license today because just due to the fact that all the permits are not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| and things, inspections and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| could we not issue a near beer permit until this fine is paid or does that just go away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| You can't penalize the subsequent owner for the acts of the previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I just had another question on procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| This is an unusual circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Is it normally we say a $1,000 fine or what is it, a 60-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| You know, I guess as a third option, can we just revoke the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| and then that gets her off the hook and then let them go ahead and complete their application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| You're empowered to do so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Again, this sliding scale you have is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| As I've mentioned previously, under state law and your own code, you don't have to extend that courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| You can revoke outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| And in this case, it may be the most appropriate methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| Do we have a motion on the floor yet or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| I'd like to make a motion that we revoke the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| I'd like to add a friendly amendment that we revoke the license effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| give them essentially give the new owner is probably going to operate under the old owner's license until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=841)|
| 0:14:09| No, he'll have to be surrendered, sir, the old license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| We've done everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| I'm told by my client to get a license here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| We're ready to go if it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Well, that's our second then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Yeah, if we do that, then we can revoke the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| We can give you your new one and then everybody, you know, we just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| I guess the only thing I was more concerned about is if you have this $1,000 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| or whatever we're going to do against you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| at some time that might crop up in the future that you had an unpaid fine against the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| I mean, you don't know what you're going to do at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| You may run a landscaping business and this could come back to bite you or haunt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| And I think just to make a clean break may be the best, you know, even for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| I believe that's the choice, her choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Well, if we do a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Yeah, a $1,000 fine or a 60-day suspension, and then she has seven days to make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| We have a motion on the floor to revoke her license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| Can I just add one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| If we revoke it, we're revoking it immediately, right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| And she may not be prepared to close on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| I guess the new owner may not be prepared to close on it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| He's applying for a license today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| You're going to close on it today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| We've got everything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| All we need is approval and then we're closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| We've got the fire marshal and everybody's inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Maybe I'll ask the law director, but I'm afraid if you suspend the license, you're not doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| Well, they're going to revoke her license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| She no longer has a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| You apply for a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| You get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| She's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Because, again, the whole essence of the commission scheme is punitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=950)|

| 0:16:09| I guess just a general comment now, I guess a word to the attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| is that this license would go to the new owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| but this address will still remain in our minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| so if we see this address again it might be an indication that the culture hadn't changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| that we just changed figure heads and we're going to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| So just as a word to the new owner, please be aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=987)|

| 0:17:46| How long had she been with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| She was a part-time employee, and she's been off since the sighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| She was in the hospital, but she only worked about eight hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| She just needed a little added income, and she did ask to see the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| but she said that she thought she got the cigarette and the beer ID mixed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| and she did ask to see it, but she did sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1090)|

| 0:18:18| I have been there for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| This is your first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Yes, and we have never been sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| I truly regret this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1104)|

| 0:18:42| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| Oh, you withdrew yours, so it's a regular motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Do you have something else, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1127)|

| 0:20:01| Sir, who sold this, you or one of your employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| It was an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Was this employee certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| How many employees are now certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| I have five certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| I was transferred over from North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| I found out about Top Shelf basically through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| Since then, all of my employees, all of them have taken this disk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| which is the company disk for alcohol management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| Everyone has taken that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| So, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| We got with a Diana Pearson, I believe it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| who we now have it scheduled for February 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| We have a class for all those that do not have the certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| I've tried to be very proactive in getting this caught up since finding out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| This cashier has had several secret shoppers, mostly tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| Our company does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| And she has never failed any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Is she still employed with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Yes, she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| The circumstances and hearsay, I guess, in a roundabout way with Ms. Pearson is my cashier's birthday is 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:27| The ID on the young man, I assume it was a young man that came in, was also 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| And she put in the day, the month was correct, and put in 87 as the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:41| I kind of lean that way because she's had other secret shoppers and if, you know, I was born in 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:50| If you were born in 53, I know how old you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| And, you know, that's why I lean to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| Ms. Pearson said that there was a font problem with a 7 and a 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| I don't believe that my cashier asked her to take it out of the wallet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| which is one of the things that Ms. Pearson will cover in the class is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| Is this clerk one of the ones that has the certification now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| No, she doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| She's scheduled for the class along with the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Do you have every shift?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| You're open 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Do you have every shift covered now with people who are certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| I have five that are certified, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| But are they covering every shift?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1354)|

| 0:23:55| Sir, did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Did you admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| I'll defer to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Same questions as before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Are all your clerks certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| About 75% of mine are certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Was this a certified clerk that sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Are they still with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| No, she's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| We terminated her the same day that she got the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| That's our company policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| To all those, you and all those who have come before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| I just want to remind you that as part of the whatever penalty process we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| you also have to submit a letter back to this board explaining what you're going to do to correct the problems in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1472)|
| 0:24:41| So I don't know if that's been explained to you or not, but that is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| That's all the questions I have, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| Mr. Chairman, make a motion for a $500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Do you want to correct that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Just for the record, I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| in terms of the letter, Commissioner Brown, it's been the commission's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| It's a case-by-case basis, and it's not a requirement in our code at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| I thought we had it for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I thought we had it for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| It's not part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| No, sir, unless it's actually made part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| My mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Within seven days, sir, if you decide to opt for the fine, it must be paid to the clerk in seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| 5E, Pit Stop, John Sevier, 3130 Circle Oak Drive, T&T Managing Partners, LLC owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:56| This also occurred on December 3rd, 2009 at the Pit Stop drive-through, 3130 Circle Oak Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1556)|
| 0:26:04| Underage drove through and purchased a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1564)|

| 0:26:21| Did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Do you admit or deny the defense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| I admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| No one wants to talk today but me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Is this the first offense, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| It says here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| But is it the first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| There was an offense from an employee who had issues with the law a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| But I don't know whatever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| This was an employee that evidently had a history that we were unaware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| And I'm not exactly sure what happened to him or why it never went any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| But he's obviously no longer employed with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| You have a little bit different situation than any other drive-through in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| in that you actually drive into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| Are all your employees certified now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Is this employee still working for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| She does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| I'm assuming she got her legs striped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| She was actually very upset and crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| But she had been employed for us for maybe six weeks and attended the class two days after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:47| After this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| I had not gotten her in it over the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| Two days after this happened was when she was supposed to attend the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| So she got certified a little too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| We fine him $500 over a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Ma'am, for a business that sells via a drive-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| is there some special consideration for the person that you have operating the register at the drive-through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:30| Or is this person also operating from the floor of the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Are they doing both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Are they selling from the drive-through and from the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| They actually walk to the car and take the order and bring the merchandise to the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| and then go in and scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Is it sort of implied that in a drive-through then there are other cars behind this car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| Hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Is that true sometimes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| So there's a certain amount of pressure in terms of time and transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Sometimes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| But I just wonder about the whole process of a drive-through alcohol sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| I don't know whether Mr. Brown has considered that in his process of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| That's just troublesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| As I stated earlier, the first case, I have a real problem with drive-throughs all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Mr. Chairman, I just have a question for Wolfie if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| I'm just kind of interested in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| This has nothing to do with your thing, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Now, the undercover person will go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| They will purchase the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| So money changes hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| And then when the person has violated, are they cited immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| As soon as my underage person walks out with the beer, I'll walk in right behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| Do we get our money back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| So what happens to the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| It goes to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| And I've got a whole bunch stashed out there that's waiting to be destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| I could help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| No, I was just wondering because obviously with the transaction, you know, there has been some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| But, you know, it might be nice if the people would give us our money back for the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| But, anyway, I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| We have to keep it for evidence as far as the criminal case goes in case someone was contested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| You know, I got it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| I charged them with Bud Light and actually sold something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| That's why I kind of stick with what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| You've got some lime there this month, though, with lime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| My girl was—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=1864)|

| 0:34:36| How often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2076)|

| 0:35:01| Sometimes we make two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| We probably average probably about three each time that we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| But this just happened to be one of those days that everyone was selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2109)|

| 0:38:11| Did we get a second to your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| There's a motion on the floor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| I want a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2298)|

| 0:38:48| Did you take the oath, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| You've been sworn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| possession, sale, manufacture, transportation of intoxicating liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| or a felony involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| Has beer been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| Do we know the status of the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Come closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| There's an outstanding license, but you'll need to be surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| He's here and got everything to turn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| And the certificate is out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| This location is for off-premises only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| On and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| It's for on and off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| It says on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| What's your relation to the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Do you lease from him or her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Lease from him, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Who else has an interest in this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| So you're going to be a sole proprietor, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Are you going to be the one operating it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Will you have employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Well, what I did, I've got one bartender and my bouncers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| and the people that's going to ID when they come in the doors, I'll have their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| We've got that completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| So they've all had server training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| I'm going to now ask some questions of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| I'll defer to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| And I'm sure someone else was about to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| But, you know, I'm trying to understand why you would want on and off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| What's the nature of your business to where you would want folks drinking there and potentially take a six-pack home with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| That's what was there before, so I just applied for the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| But it sounds like it's more like a bar since you said you have a bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| So would you be comfortable with it just being an on-premises license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| We've kind of shied away from going with giving folks abilities to sell on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:46| I mean, it's going to be up to the body, but I guess I'll ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| is that something that you're just dead set on having both of those licenses, or would you want on-premises only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| I prefer to have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| I mean, whatever you decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| I have the same concerns Mr. McKenzie has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| It's never a good idea to have on and off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| There are some special situations, boat docks and things like that, where I voted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| But for the most part, I just don't believe it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| You're putting yourself in a position to where you have a good customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| they come in and drink three or four beers, and then they ask for a six-pack to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| And you're going to be in a position where you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| do I make this gentleman mad so that he quits patronizing my business by saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| you've already had five and you don't need to be drinking beer on the way home, or do you deny the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2515)|
| 0:42:04| What is the situation like out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Are there other places, are there other off-premise places to buy beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| Are there convenience stores in that general area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Yes, there's a convenience store right beside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| I'm not saying how I'll vote on this or not, but I will say that I am leaning toward on-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:26| But I think you, if you'll think about it, by having that option available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| and what this commission does, what this beer board does is it has, you know, we can fine you a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:42| But if you have a customer that drinks alcohol in your bar, and then they take a six-pack to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| and they drink that alcohol while they're driving down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| you may be opening yourself to some pretty serious liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| and I think you may make it actually easier on yourself if you amended this and said, I just want on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| That way you can tell that customer that decided to leave just before you cut them off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| you can tell that customer, I'm sorry, I can't sell you to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| I've only got on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| So are you sure you don't want to amend that to just on-premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| Be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| I'd like to move that the request for permit be approved as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| Does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| It's on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| You have something else, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| You, Commissioner Peenston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Yes, I was going to talk to the law director there, asked him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| I don't believe in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| We can deny these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| And, you know, we shouldn't be scolding people up here for what they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| We either vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| That's all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| The law says that we have to give them the permits if they reach the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| And we shouldn't be trying to coerce them to change their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| I didn't try to force anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| I just asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| I mean, I think I'm within our rights to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| We do have to give these permits if they meet the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Do you have something else, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| I mean, I just wanted to say I'm not trying to force anybody to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| I just simply wanted to point out that it may actually serve his business better if he just did on-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| and explain some situations he could put himself in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| And I didn't say how I was going to vote on this one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| And if the motion is that we grant it as requested, then I may well go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| I just wanted to point out that there were some personal reasons why he may choose to not want on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=2688)|

| 1:14:20| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Mr. Chairman, I raised this question in the Finance Committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| about the Board of Zoning Appeals and how it was composed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| and how people were selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| And after some discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| I thought we were of the opinion that the Board of Zoning Appeals was seated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| with nine citizens in place of nine commissioners because of some recent court ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:45| and that the nine appointees were based on nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:53| I was not really concerned with the qualifications of persons being asked to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| I was concerned about the process by which they were selected because of a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| And it may be that in the ninth district, at some upcoming point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| the current representative of what I thought was the eighth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| may have to turn in his resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| And then how was that person selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| If I remember the process that we went through whenever the citizens were seated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| on the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| I believe I even traveled as far as Craig Leuthold's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| listening to the people that were wanting to be selected to represent the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| Is there something that I'm missing here now or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| The only thing I'm concerned about is this Board of Zoning Appeals based on residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| That seemed to be a concern the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Not my concern, but it seemed to be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| I'll let the Law Director address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Mr. Chairman, members of the Board, my review of your code does not require that kind of configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| And from what I understand from Grant Rosenberg, that has not been the policy in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:20| But there's no legal requirement that they're appointed by commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| And I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| I believe that the Board of Zoning Appeals was one commissioner from each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| and seated as such and that they were then either reappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| or the other commissioner appointed, that occurring every September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:50| I believe also in the paperwork that I've seen you distribute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| it said they were denominated as seats one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| And that denomination, in my opinion, was based on the district of residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:12| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Since 1990, that I know of, every district has had a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| This is very dangerous, what could happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| Right now, we would be giving the fourth district two votes for this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| I have nothing against this gentleman at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| but the people in the first district will not have any voice on the Board of Zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| What concerns me is it could be possible that we could get five votes from one district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:45| by breaking this trend that we've always had, one representative from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| These other districts can become dumping grounds for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| Every district here requires equal representation as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| I cannot vote for anybody that is nominated out of district one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| is not nominated out of district one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| I completely agree with Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Also, you know, it was a longstanding tradition that commissioners serve on the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| one commissioner per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| There was a law that was passed that basically said that the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| we couldn't appoint ourselves or couldn't appoint our own members to various boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| It was the way the law was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| it basically said that commissioners could not serve on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| Later, the legislators went back and corrected themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| and changed it so that things like BZA commissioners could sit on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4734)|
| 1:19:01| Now, unless something has changed, I think that commissioners would be eligible to sit there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| and I would be inclined to prefer a commissioner from the first district over any other applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:15| My understanding, and I probably talked to our legislators more than anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| talked to several of them a couple of times a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| and I remember them changing it so that commissioners could serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| So I'm going to make the motion that we appoint Sam McKenzie to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| We already have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Well, I'll make a substitute motion that we appoint Sam McKenzie to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| He's a commissioner from the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| I believe now that based on the way the law has been changed, he's eligible to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| And I think he would be a wonderful voice for the people of the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| Thank you, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| I don't feel that that is the direction that I've been given from the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| thus my application for a tyranny begs for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| So I'm going to have to decline that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| Mr. Chairman, I was just asking the law director, can commissioners serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| Has the law been changed to allow that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| It's my understanding that as a result, again, commissioners serve on several other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| I believe that's permissible, but going back to your code real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| Section 6.60 reads that the establishment of a Board of Zoning Appeals, Knox County, is authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| Such boards shall consist of nine members appointed by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| The members of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall occupy seats here and after denominated as one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:54| Those are the seats denominated, but, again, it doesn't read that it's commission districts one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4854)|
| 1:21:01| I want to go back to something that Commissioner Wright was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| and I think we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| When we appointed BZA, as we have done with other appointments, we've put out a call for resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| anyone who would be interested in serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| So in this situation, we have a vacancy on seat one or district one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| I believe that we need to follow our procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Let's put out a call for anyone interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Let's get resumes and let's hold a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Now, we've done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| We did it for all the other BZAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| I think that we're going backwards instead of forwards if we don't have a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| and if we don't bring these folks before us to at least be interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| I have nothing wrong with this individual that they have brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| but I do believe that the process calls for us to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| and I think that we as a body need to follow what we have set a precedent for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| and that is complete, total, open communication with the public to allow them to also give their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:53| and also just have the public hearing process before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| Would you like to make a motion to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| I'll make a motion to that effect, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| That will be a substitute motion that we accept applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| and that we have a subsequent public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| I'd like to make a friendly amendment to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| that we accept applications from people who actually live in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| Well, according to our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| They can go through the interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| I mean, they can go through the interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| We have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Did someone second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| We still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| Just a housekeeping matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| What is the term that we would be appointing whoever to, whether it be Mr. Bates or someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:46| Maybe the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| The term to the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| What is the term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| I believe so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Well, I think we change when the commission changes for your term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4976)|
| 1:23:04| Commissioner Burke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Mr. Law Director, you were quoting the ordinance that pertained to the makeup of the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| as far as it only numerates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| It doesn't define what each seat would be as a commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| I mean, your code is codified as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| So what we would need to do, because I agree with Commissioner Wright, I recall the discussion that we wanted to have one BZA commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:39| per county commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| So I think we need to amend our ordinance so that it reflects that discussion if it doesn't reflect it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| But I don't think today is the day to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| I think that's something we can put on the agenda for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| And I guess I'll just say, wow, thanks for all the support for the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| And hopefully as projects come up for the first district that I'll have similar support for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| We've talked about a lot of things here, this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| And we kind of moved the conversation from law to precedent to past practice to I just like it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5060)|
| 1:24:30| We need to be consistent, okay, on what our standards are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| Are we going to have public forms for all board appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| Are we going to bring them all before us, either in that district or here at the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| for all boards and other appointments that we make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| I think we need to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| You know, what I tend to do is say, if I'm looking at a district person, another district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| that this person has been vetted properly and that this name that they're going to bring forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:07| be it the library board or something else, is a person that, say, the ninth district wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| So am I a little offended by all the help and scrutiny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| Yes, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| I'll get over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| With that said, let's turn to Mr. Bates, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| He works in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| He's very active in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| And his activity is through the Urban League, which sits in the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| another kind of young adult trying to make Knoxville a better place type activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| His passion resides within the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| You all wouldn't know that because you don't know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| So that's why I put his name forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| So, you know, and one other thing, and I don't want to get too deep in this, but Knoxville is an interesting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| It's an interesting place from a demographic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| A person like Mr. Bates, he's moved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| He's not a native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| You know, he didn't choose to move within the first district for whatever reason, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| maybe proximity to other things, but he's extremely active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| And to be quite honest, I have not seen a lot of African Americans offered up by the other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| So what I'm stuck with here is we have all these people that want to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| but they're not going to be able to get in from district X, let's call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| So, you know, as I see them being active, I want to give them an opportunity to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:36| Again, I don't see that coming through county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| and it's not a knock on anyone because, you know, they're probably a really small minority in other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:47| So with all that said, it's a different dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| So just to put a cookie cutter around it and say, no, the first district needs to be represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| no one will represent the first district better than Mr. Bates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| You all didn't know that because you don't necessarily know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| But say that, you know, Sam's a pretty reasonable guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| He understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| He's passionate about the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| I hear that at least for the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| And he wouldn't offer up some Joe Blow that's really got the fourth district in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| that's going to build up Sequoia Hills, you know, even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| That's not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| So I guess with that said, I really can't support the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:28| And I hope that, you know, we can discuss whether it can be a commissioner or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| That's a separate discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| I have a hold in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| The person that I initially offered up has resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| So I need to fill that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| They have a meeting, I think, on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| So I just ask you all to consider the process that I went through to come up with Mr. Bates as a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5268)|
| 1:27:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| We have some more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| Commissioner Browse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| I just want to say that I do know Tierney Bates and think very, very highly of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| And I hope that he will be involved in citizen boards and in government at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5292)|
| 1:28:20| I think he's an outstanding young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| But I do and I understand also that there aren't a lot of African-Americans being offered up by other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:30| There aren't a lot of women being offered up by other districts either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| But I think that very, very strongly that our BZA appointees need to reside in the district that they're representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:47| And I've asked Mr. Jarrett to draw up an ordinance that we can consider next month that would straighten all of this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:55| so that we don't run into this kind of problem again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| I agree with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| I think that he represents his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| If he wishes to choose somebody that does not reside in his district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| he's the one that will suffer from a bad appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| So I absolutely defer to his wisdom and discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| I think he's an excellent commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| And I don't see the process of vetting people in public forums as being helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| I just disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| I think Mr. McKenzie's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| And I think that's a perfectly legitimate way to select a BZA person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| I don't think there's any assurance that if we just do it by districts, we're going to get somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| or we're going to have our BZA representing this community in the best possible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| What we need to do is choose the best possible people to man the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| And I think that's what Sam's done in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Commissioner Fondas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| I also agree with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| And I know Mr. Bates, and that's the reason I was willing to cosponsor this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| I think he would be an outstanding representative of the first district and the entire county on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:20| So that's the reason I sponsored this, and I hope you all will look favorably on this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Could you repeat your motion, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| The motion is that we declare a vacancy for seat number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| and that we ask for resumes from individuals who are interested in that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| that we hold a public hearing with this body, that they come before us, answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| and then we can vote subsequent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| Is everyone clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| We need a roll call vote, starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| Commissioner McKenzie votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5470)|

| 1:32:45| the law director, what you said about it being from the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| Commissioner, we would need to change the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| and it would require two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| But that's what she's talking about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| I would like to get on there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| I've sent Mr. Jarrett an email about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| I'd like to co-sponsor that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| We're moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| appointing Mr. Bill Cole, Ms. Linda Murawski,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| and Mr. Marvin Hammond to the Knox County Emergency Communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5593)|

| 1:33:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| I just want to ask about the process on the selection of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| I knew that was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| I believe these are the mayor's appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| I mean, but these are public boards, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| Come on, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| I mean, if we're going to do this, let's vet these folks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| I mean, this is an important board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| I mean, I'm not making light of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| I'm being very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| You know, the E911 is a valuable service here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| So I'm going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| Do you want to address this, someone from the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:21| I'd be glad to, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| Obviously, I don't have VTIs for the nominees with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| but I can tell you that Mrs. Linda Murawski| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| and her husband run a small independent company that provides contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| services for security exercises for the Department of Energy in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| Mr. Bill Cole is a retired FBI agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| He is going to serve in the spot that is reserved for community-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| emergency service agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| He is active in the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| And Mr. Marvin Hammond is the CEO emeritus of Hallsdale Power Utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| District, has also been involved in some Homeland Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| and infrastructure protection work over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| and will be serving in one of the citizen appointee capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| So, Commissioner McKenzie, I'm not sure what else I could share with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| but I would represent to you, in the strongest possible terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| that these are well-credentialed nominees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| very capable of serving in the positions that we bring them to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| And I'm not, I mean, this isn't personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| but I'd take your word on that at this point, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| that you've vetted them out and you're comfortable with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| You know, I hate that we've gotten to the point where we've got to justify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| you know, explain why we make every single vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| I'm going to vote no on the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| and I'm going to support the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| And the reason we don't have a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| and I was just going to say that, you know, when we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| when we are the vetting process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| I think we need to do our job and vet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| When it's a mayor's appointment, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| if I see no reason not to approve what work they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| I mean, I don't want to say I rubber stamp it, I look over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| yeah, I don't know anything about any of these folks that would give me cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| not to vote against them, then I generally defer to their logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:33| It's their appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| We just get to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| And so that's why I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5801)|

| 1:37:58| where you can walk in just about any time, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| Any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Just so people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| We absolutely do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| And I just want to say, I just had my shot, the most painless shot I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| I couldn't even tell she stuck me with the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| So if you're going to get this anyway, I recommend doing it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| I'm going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| I'm going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| Before I move into other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| You have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Well, I was just going to ask you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| We have a couple of people that will be addressed in the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| We've had a lot of discussion between the two of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| and he wants to come and present to us as much as possible about what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| so we can have a clear view of when the budget is presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| what the ideas are from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, County Commission, for having me before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| I'll be very brief in the interest of getting the Farragut boys golf team back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:05| I wanted to start off very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| and give you a brief overview of some of the preliminary assumptions that we are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| in the fiscal year 2011 budget development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| We are at the very beginning of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| but as we have had our conversations over the past year talking about our fiscal situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| the commission has asked that we work through some of these challenges collaboratively with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:30| with myself, with you as our funding body and our appropriating body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| So I thought it prudent and appropriate for me to come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| to probably spend five or seven minutes with you talking about some of the preliminary assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| that we have made in the budget development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| and to just give you a signal that the news from our perspective probably isn't great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| But this is, as I say, the very beginning of our budget development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| These are our very preliminary assumptions about where some of the budget dynamics may go for the coming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| And the basic dynamic is that we are assuming that our revenue streams are roughly flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| that there aren't any huge increases in revenues that we are necessarily expecting for the coming fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6008)|
| 1:40:15| and yet we are seeing some dynamics around some of our expenditure obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| that may lead to some increases there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| Therefore, we are potentially looking at a budget gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| a gap between our expected revenues and our likely expenditures that could be substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| and that we'll have to work diligently to work down and make sure that we are able to close that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:39| So up on the board, and I believe on your screens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| there should be a very brief one-page description of some of those expenditure obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| and some of the dynamics that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| First of all, at the top of the page, you'll see in terms of revenues, our current budget was just over $375 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:58| One of the dynamics that will come before you next month in the education consent calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| is the transition of the kindergarten intervention program from the Great Schools Partnership to the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:11| And we talked about this when we talked about the budget last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| I told you to expect this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| The trustees of the Great Schools Partnership and the Board of Education have both approved this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| And what it is is the Great Schools Partnership has been an incubator of some really innovative programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| and now we are ready for those programs, as they have matured, to transition into the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| for us to take full ownership of them, including both the program and the financial resources that go along with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| So that will be an increase, essentially, in our appropriation, a transfer from the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| to the Knox County Schools of $1.18 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| You'll also see that we did use some of our fund balance to fund some one-time expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:58| that were in our fiscal year, the current year, fiscal year 10 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| And as we begin our development process for next year, we basically have to recognize that those are not recurring revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| But on the expenditure side, I think I want to spend a couple more minutes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| What we do see is some potential fixed costs and increases that are likely to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| that are going to have implications for our budget, the first of which is step increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| And there's both a state component to that and a local component to that, particularly for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| And that looks like about $3.95 million right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| The big one really is these retirement contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| And our best estimates right now are on our retirement contributions, particularly for the Teachers Retirement Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| which is the TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| We got a letter recently that said we are to expect a $5.7 million increase in our contributions for the Teacher Retirement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:53| for this coming year, a one-year increase of $5.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| Really, a relatively substantial increase, a very substantial increase in our contributions for teachers' retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6178)|
| 1:43:05| Unfortunately, the way that this works is teacher retirement funds and other types of retirement funds are investment-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| And when there's a bad economy, their investments go down, and they pass those costs along to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| because they have to show that they are financially sound and that they are actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| So unfortunately, we're looking at a $5.7 million increase to the teachers' retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| About a million-dollar increase also in terms of the closed defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| That's the City A retirement system as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| So those are some pretty substantial hits there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| And then some fairly routine increases in terms of things like health insurance, unemployment compensation, our debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:44| And then there's also been a change in really a clarification by the State of Tennessee in terms of fees that can be charged in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:53| And basically, no fee can be charged for an activity that occurs during the school day as part of the regular curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| So things like band fees and field trip fees and things of that nature are a revenue stream that may be in jeopardy for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:09| And unless we are going to stop doing those activities, which we obviously not want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| we're probably going to have to set aside some resources to be able to fund that potential decrease in revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| So all of that leads us to a situation where if we're looking at relatively flat revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| and we're looking at expenditure increases at first blush of about $15-some-odd million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:35| it's about a gap of about $18.87 million as our preliminary assumptions in terms of the fiscal year 2011 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:43| Now, having said that, our job over the next weeks and months is to work with the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| to work with our staff in the Knox County Schools to have additional conversation with all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| around how we work down some of these numbers, how we mitigate some of these expenditure dynamics that we're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| and then also developing strategies to reduce, to reallocate, to find efficiencies to be able to narrow that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6300)|
| 1:45:10| And I fully expect that as we do that and develop those strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| that we'll be in a position to present a balanced budget to the school board at their meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| which I hope they'll vote on in April and then bring before you as part of the budget vote that you'll make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6321)|
| 1:45:28| hopefully in the May time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| The one thing I will say, and I said this last year and I'll continue to say it, we have some very ambitious goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| We have some very ambitious plans in the Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| and limited resources will not be used as an excuse to not reach those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| We want to and we will provide an outstanding education to every child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| and we will maximize every dollar that we have in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your time, and I'm glad to take questions if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| But that concludes my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Yes, Dr. McIntyre, thank you for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| Should Tennessee receive funds from the Race to the Top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| I saw figures of I believe it's $23 million maybe coming to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| Regardless of the figure, should Tennessee be selected for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| Will these funds help reduce any of the costs to help get this figure down from, say, $18 million to another figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:26| Commissioner, thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| And the reason is that the Race to the Top is an education reform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| and innovation fund that is meant to be supplemental to the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| So it will allow us to do some of the things that are in our strategic plan that we think are vitally important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:42| like focusing on teacher effectiveness, like focusing on great principal leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| like using data to inform instruction and working through some of the interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| that we think we need to improve some of our low-achieving schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| But that would not necessarily impact our core budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| That is intended to be supplemental to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| And that is also, to some extent, a competitive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| It is certainly a competitive process for the states who are applying to the federal government for those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| Even if Tennessee is successful, some portion of those dollars may be competitive also from the states to the localities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:18| However, there is meant to be, I believe it's 50% of those resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| if the state is successful in securing the Race to the Top funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| that will go to individual school districts based on the Title I formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| And that's probably the figure that you saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| But those dollars are to be used specifically for the assurances under the Race to the Top application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| which are meant to be supplemental innovations to what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| You know, are there synergies there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Are these things that we want to do anyway and the Race to the Top money would give us some additional resources to get them done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| So there's great alignment between the Race to the Top application and our strategic plan in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6474)|
| 1:48:01| But I don't think it will do a whole lot to mitigate the basic challenge that we face in our core budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| It will, however, allow us to do a lot more things that we want to do that are innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| and that are going to improve education for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| Dr. McIntyre, how much increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| I don't have the figure for me for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| What did we increase last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| How does this 18 compare to last year or 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| Well, last year we had our final budget was roughly a level funded budget from where it had been the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| And we worked down a budget, a preliminary budget gap, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| somewhere around maybe $12 or $13 million at our initial assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| And I think the big difference this year is that big retirement contribution hit that we're going to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| And, you know, the folks at TCRS, when they wrote the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| said that they've used their statistical smoothing techniques to smooth that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| But that's a pretty big hit, even after it's been smoothed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| Maybe I should ask Mr. Thomas back there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| We just passed a resolution here three or four months ago for Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| If you come up with an idea that will save Knox County money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| we're going to try it for you and then bonus you part of that savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| We work with Human Resources with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Do you have something like that in place for school teachers or school employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| if they come up with an idea that will help you save this $18.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| that we could try to save some money and bonus them for their ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| Not that I'm aware of, but last year we began a process of holding community budget forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:38| and they were actually pretty well attended, and we got lots of really good ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| some of which we did act on from those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| A lot of folks gave ideas, sent in ideas via e-mail to myself or to the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| So we really got a lot of great, I think, brainstorming around our budget last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| and we will continue to have those budget forums this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| We'll have one on March 2nd and another on March 25th to invite the public to be part of the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| as we seek to close this gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| Well, we did that in conjunction with Human Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| and there are several good ideas already, and we know that they're going to be paying some out next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| So maybe it's something that Human Resources, you might want to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| and maybe work with that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| Anyway, we can save the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| Just a quick question for John Troyer, since we're talking about budgets and deficits, possible deficits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:34| How much do you expect a penny to bring in on the tax rate this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| I know last year it was close to a million, maybe a little short of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| Our net number after the reappraisal came out right at $940,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6642)|
| 1:50:48| and we haven't done a formal calculation yet, but I think just a good estimate, $975,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:56| I think $975,000, $980,000 would be a really good starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| I'm sure I'll be back as we get further along in our solutions to this budget challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| I'm here today to talk about our community grants process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| As you all know, we're beginning our budget process right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| and community grants are one piece of our department's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| A few things, and Ben here is going to be handing out an outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| and deadlines timeline for our community grants process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| A few things that I would like to point out, what we're going to do this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| last year we had five panels set up, and what we're going to do this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| what we're going to propose doing this year is shrinking those five panels to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| We're going to set up a panel for homeless supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| We're going to set up a panel for tourism and art and cultural services and programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| and then we're going to have a general community grants panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| And what I'm here today to do is ask that you all be engaged and involved in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| but also ask the Chairman if he would appoint one of you to each of the panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:22| so appoint three commissioners, one for each of those panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| to be involved in this process and engaged throughout the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| and really just here to answer any questions you all may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| Question, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| Do you know how much money that you're going to have to work with this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| We do not have the numbers yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| We're kind of waiting on our finance department, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| and the mayor as we move forward with the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| However, we want to go ahead and get started on the actual panel process now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| so we're ready to move once we get the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:58| Thank you, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| Turn it over to Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| When do you need those names, Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| As you can see in your handout, our first orientation meeting for the panelists will be March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| the week of March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| So theoretically, it would be obviously better for us to have some names today or by the end of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| Otherwise, certainly by next commission meeting we could work with that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:31| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| Thank you, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| We're going to go do our four honorariums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| Mr. Chairman, real quick question back to Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| Grant, are you going to send letters out to the people that were on the committee last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| to see if they want to serve again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Yeah, we intend to use existing pool of panelists as we had last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:53| and we've already contacted most of the panelists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| and we're going to send out letters today to the agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| and we go live with our website and media advisory tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| So we'll be taking applications beginning tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| and, again, the timeline is there before you as far as all the deadlines for the agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:15| We're going to do the four honorariums so the kids can get back to school for one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:22| But before we do those, it's been brought to my attention that we have Commission Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| It's on page 15 of the Commission Rules book, and it addresses honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6869)|
| 1:54:38| I'm going to read it to you real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| Each commissioner shall be entitled to one primary sponsorship of an honorarium resolution per calendar year quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:47| to be presented on the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| Such presentations should not be cumulative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| The primary sponsor of an honorary resolution shall be that commissioner whose name appears first on the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6893)|
| 1:55:02| as requesting the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| This section does not apply to memorial resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| Since it's been brought to my attention, we will start honoring this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| So to refresh your memory, go back to page 15 of your Commission Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:21| Question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| Are we starting from zero, or are we going back to the first of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| Well, this is the first of the year, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| So we're not going to go from budget year to budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| We'll go January on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Well, it's every quarter anyway, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| On page two, resolution 101 is a resolution of the Commission of Noss County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| honoring UT lifestyle paramedic Rick Harrington upon the occasion of his receipt of the Lifetime Achievement Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6946)|
| 1:55:52| from the Tennessee Region II Emergency Medical Services Director Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6952)|
| 1:56:01| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Nine-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| Seven-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| Commissioner Oppenheimer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| I guess I busted that rule wide open today, didn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Well, you didn't know about it, so we'll probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| You know, it's not every day that you get an opportunity to recognize someone with outstanding awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| and Rick Harrington served also with me at the rescue squad, but he received the award today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:29| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| Could I get a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| Whereas Rick Harrington, a flight paramedic with UT Lifestyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| was recently awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Tennessee Region II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| Emergency Medical Services Directors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| And whereas flight paramedics are unique professionals who fly aboard helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| and other special flights as part of a medical team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| and are tasked with stabilizing patients in critical emergency situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| who are being flown to hospitals or other healthcare facilities for treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| Whereas, aside from their complex medical duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| flight paramedics perform as the aircraft's crew chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| and ground safety officer while aboard the helicopter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| And while aboard in the scene of medical facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| the flight paramedic will assist the pilot with navigation, radio communications, and air traffic avoidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part1?start=7048)|
