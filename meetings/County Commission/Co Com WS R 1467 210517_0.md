| 0:01:00| Commissioner Spoonmaker, would you give us a second rendition of our Pledge of Allegiance here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| Would everyone please rise and face our nation's flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=65)|
| 0:01:13| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=73)|
| 0:01:21| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=81)|
| 0:01:29| Thank you, Commissioner Spoonmaker. Unless I hear objections, here is how I intend on conducting tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=89)|
| 0:01:37| We'll first set the agenda and we'll hold our first part of public forum. We have one member of the public who has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=97)|
| 0:01:45| Then we'll jump into the agenda as presented. Any other thoughts? Yes, sir. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| Chairman Jay, if it's okay, I would like to ask my fellow commissioners if they would like to sign on to my honorary resolution for the National Foster Care Awareness Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=111)|
| 0:02:05| I'm seeing nods all the way around. I believe we will turn that into a full commission. Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=125)|
| 0:02:15| Okay, seeing no other lights, we will proceed with setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| Our amendments to the, excuse me, the additions to our agenda are items number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| We have one withdrawal, that's number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| Our deferrals include 43, 50, 51, and 53. Those are all deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=154)|
| 0:02:46| And then our non-consent items are 1 through 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| I'm going to do these in order. 39, 40, 41, 42, 48, and 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=181)|
| 0:03:15| So once again, our non-consents are 1 through 9, 39, 40, 41, 42, 48, and 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=195)|
| 0:03:25| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Seeing none, I'll entertain a motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| Second by Commissioner Ward, first by Commissioner Smith. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| All those in favor, please say aye. Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| The agenda is now set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| All of our honorary resolutions will be read next week and presented next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| Our presentations will also be presented next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Then we have two presentations to hear, and we'll move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| We have one member of the public signed up, Mr. Johns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=245)|
| 0:04:18| If you would, sir, please state your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| And you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| Point of clarification, I was going to speak on agenda item 40A, CSL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| Do you want me to speak now or later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Your choice. If you'd like to stick around, we can wait until that time happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| and I'll call you back up, or you could go ahead and do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Let's just go ahead and do it now. Give me one second there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| And again, if you'll just start with your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Sure. Bill Johns, mailing address 111-24 Kingston Pike, 119-335.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=284)|
| 0:04:52| I live in District 5, 379-34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| So I am Bill Johns, and I'm going to talk about a couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| I've got four minutes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| First of all, is the downtown stadium project a done deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| I sure hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| That is very bothersome to me since it's been around for nine months in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| We haven't had much citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| I'm also discouraged when I read about how we have people flying on private jets to go and look at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| I think that gets rid of public administration neutrality and objectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| So for some of the people who do not know me, I'm just going to read a quick CV here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| One of the few people in the country that has an MPA, MBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| I have been involved in economic and community development for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| I have witnessed in Memphis, Tennessee, through the 80s through 2000s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| all the mistakes that are happening with public partnerships on such things as economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| when it comes down to public stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| I'm just going to be brief because I'm going to be sending each one of you some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| My background includes consulting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| I'm talking about this RFP with the Convention Sports and Leisure International, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| I'm going to be sending you information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| There are some facts you do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| We think this is a very small firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| It's a small firm, ironically, out of Dallas and Minneapolis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| where their offices were five miles from my corporate apartments when I worked for 3M| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| and also working for a software company in Dallas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| What is very interesting about this RFP, and I've read it many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| there's no mention of really who they are and really what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| This is not a small entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| In 2011, they were acquired by Legends.net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| You probably have never heard of Legends.net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| They are a billion-dollar company that has been founded by the owners of the Dallas Cowboys and New York Yankees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| They do a lot of great things with concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| They also have a lot of interesting clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Some of their clients, if included in the past, right off their website is the NCAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| so that might be a UT thing, the Tennessee Titans, also the Cleveland Browns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| that ownership group formerly used to own the Smokies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| and also the World Wrestling Entertainment, WWE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| One of the things they do for WWE is they do all their exhibit displays, their stores, their kiosks, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| So here you have a much larger company that is coming in, and they do a lot of interesting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| They are subsidized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| This is so much profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Just this past February, Sixth Street Partners, a $50 billion investment firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| formerly founded by Goldman Sachs executives off the 2009 crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| have made a strategic investment into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| CSL, to me, is very interesting because if you start looking and reading on some of the references,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| some of the top analysts, one of them who has wrote Field of Schemes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| refers to CSL as the wily e-coyote of the sports stadium racket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| I think that's a Roadrunner reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| And also the gentleman who wrote Convention Center Follies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| CSL has a track record of overly optimistic and inaccurate forecasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| You can find their studies all over the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| You can look up on the companies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Me, I find it very interesting because I have a consulting background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| My consulting background crosses the path of me and these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| because there is something called independent consulting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| then there is something called consultive selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| This is a consultive selling group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| That means they get to come in and do some analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| They're going to take some pictures, and they're going to use existing models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| and they're going to come up with the value proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| That value proposition is going to help reduce your risk as decision makers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| to move forward and try to make a investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| I predict this could be a billion dollar blunder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| and I will let you know why that in a later correspondence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| The other thing that's very interesting about this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| with all this investment going into them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| they're not going to be just making money off consulting studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| Their investment is long-term relationships with communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| With the former Golden Sacks investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| they know the bond industry very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| If you want to know your number three items, your debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| you go and fund a public stadium and see what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Everybody who is fleeing these other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| are going to tell you one of the reasons they're fleeing is because of high taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| I ask you to delay this for 60 to 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| so you could actually have citizen input, active information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| and get real facts what's going on before you send the welcome wagon up to the Death Star,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| open the bunker to the zombie, or bring that alien egg onto the starship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| This thing is going to hurt our community if it's publicly financed from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you, and I'm open for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=610)|

| 0:13:17| was started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| This process was handled by PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| They'll be the one directing this, so I'm going to defer to Miss Jane here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=802)|

| 0:13:32| My name is Jane Burrett with the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| And to tell you about this project, I know that the county and city had initiative to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| try and help get CGI here to Knoxville, and I know they can speak to that more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| We've got representatives from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| But I was asked, we're going to be managing the summer place facility, and this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| tower in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| We already have two tenants in the building, and this would be for the fourth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| And so we've just been working with them on how we could work and still cover the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| of the facility, but yet give them a win deal to port them to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=845)|
| 0:14:13| It's my understanding that the summer place is going to be, and it will be, I'll ask Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| Caldwell and the mayor to do, if not now, Chris, just do a report in June, because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| starting our budget in July, what our vision is for summer place and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| That's in June, no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| How did we come up with the, I did some checking with some realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| How did we come up with $9 a square foot when downtown, we're looking at 18 to 20, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| pay the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| 21 to 24, we pay, we would pay the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| How did we come up with $9 a square foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| What we did was, this was discussed as, when it was known as Project Hopper with the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| and one thing that we talked about was wanting to get those jobs relocated here, and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=905)|
| 0:15:13| thing that we offered them was temporary space until they found, and until they either decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| to go somewhere else in permanent space or build new Cherokee farms, and so we offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| them temporary space at cost as an economic incentive to get them to relocate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=926)|
| 0:15:39| Excuse me, it says here in the agreement that the payment goes to PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| Will that go in the general fund or PBA's account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| So ultimately, what PBA would do is the expense that we have quoted, which is $9, pays for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=950)|
| 0:16:01| anything that we associate with summer place, so as far as we're concerned, it's a wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| The revenue offsets the expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| So it goes to the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Well, it would go to PBA, which has those expenses, so the revenue offsets the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| Jane, that brings up the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Do you have any idea how much utilities would cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| The utilities, we based it on current numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| I don't have that number with me tonight, but I know we've got two other tenants in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=991)|

| 0:16:43| One of them has been there quite a few years, and they're just now at 1,367 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| It's a Class C office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| It's not comparable to BB&T or Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| So, I mean, if you see the facility, it is not in that type of shape, so we try to compare it to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1013)|
| 0:17:02| Do we pay their utilities also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| We will pay their utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| We will not pay their janitorial costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| They'll pay that separately, and we are not including parking because we will not have that opportunity in this garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| That's a couple of my other questions down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1035)|

| 0:17:20| You're talking about the janitorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| It says here within 30 days of receipt of the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1042)|

| 0:17:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| It is $6,052 per year for janitorial, and that's a pass-through with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| We hire the staff that does the cleaning, and then we just bill them the exact cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| If they decide to go with full carpet cleaning, window cleaning, we're at $9,227 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1068)|

| 0:18:02| And then if they decide to do carpet cleaning, window cleaning, it goes up to $9,227.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| They have to pay that monthly or divided by 12 or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| Monthly, we'll bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| Parking, how many employees do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Chris, do you know how many employees they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| I think I'm hearing 51 is what we've pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| And also, we've got one of the heads from CGI here today with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| If you all would like to hear from them about what we're going to do in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| I'd love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| It's not top secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| It was Project Hopper for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| Hopper's went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| If you would just restate your name and your address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1137)|

| 0:19:06| I've got with me this evening Will LaBar, who is the interim director of CGI's Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| And he can speak to kind of the employee ramp up and where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| and how many folks they expect to have in that temporary space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| So, Will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Welcome to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| If you'll state your name and your address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Can you guys hear me all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| My name is Will LaBar, William LaBar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| I'm the vice president with CGI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| I'd be happy to tell you a little bit about the company and our plans here for Knoxville, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| CGI is the fifth largest independent global IT and business process service provider in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| We're headquartered in Montreal, Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| We have about 76,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| If I say the word members, that's what we call our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| We have about 76,000 members located in 40 countries around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| About 12,500 of those are in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| And about 1,800 of those are in a program that we call our U.S. Onshore Delivery Center program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| which is where we create centers of excellence in smaller cities around the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| to create public-private partnerships with universities, local governments, and state governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| to help diversify the economy and create new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Knoxville is the eighth of our centers in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| We're extremely excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| I could probably go on for a long time about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| We're very, very excited about our partnership with Knoxville, with UT, and the jobs that we're creating here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| Our plan is to create 300 jobs within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| If you look at our track record, we've had this program with these public-private partnerships since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| We started it in Lebanon, Virginia, which is fairly close by if you're familiar with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| We're 16 years into that center and still have close to 400 members working there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| The types of jobs we're creating are software development jobs, IT consulting jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| The average salary will be at a minimum around $68,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| Our hiring pattern typically in the centers is a combination of university-based hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| as well as open market or experienced hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| In some cases, it's around 50-50, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| We have a dedicated team focused on recruiting out of schools like UT as well as other schools in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| so we'll relocate students here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| I'm trying to think about other highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| We made the announcement at the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| Sorry, time has a weird way of acting on you during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Since then, we've hired our first eight members here already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| We have 20 open requisitions that we're currently sourcing for through our university program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| Those offers are starting to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| I think as of last week, our first college offer went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| We have about 25 or more open market requisitions that we're currently sourcing for as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| We've hit the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| I think that's probably a good overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| If you want more details about the type of work or any of that stuff, I didn't go too deep into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| First of all, thank you for being here in Houston, Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Is the building there at Cherokee Farms, is that your building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| That they're building now, is that a different building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| The summer place will be our temporary building while we finalize the search and decision for our permanent location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1373)|
| 0:23:02| That has yet to be decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| We're still in negotiations on where that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| It'll be within the city of Knoxville, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| District, are you looking to build or are you looking to rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| We're open to either, actually, and we're in conversations about both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| If you're looking to build, it may be longer than 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| That's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| We'll be prepared to flex in a certain way if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| In general, just our working pattern will probably include some sort of hybrid capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| where some days you might work from home and some days from the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| We obviously won't exceed the capacity of summer place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| but we'll be able to have more members in Knoxville than the seats in summer place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| For example, all of the members who started with us today have been onboarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| and they're working virtually from home already, even though we don't have an office in Knoxville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| 7,000 square feet, if that's your office, you're going to be a lonely man for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| I've made a lot of good friends in Knoxville, just connecting with a lot of folks around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| I don't think I'll be too lonely yet, but I appreciate the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1453)|
| 0:24:22| How many there, just for informational purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| how many members do you think will be there in the next year, year and 18 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| When our first wave of college hiring is done, assuming we've found enough candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1473)|
| 0:24:41| we'll have those 20 members onboarded in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| With our open recs now, we'll hopefully by July or August have close to 40-something members in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1485)|
| 0:24:54| So we will fill, if you're doing literally one-to-one seat matching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| we'll have those 50 members before the end of the calendar year easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| Very good. I'd like to say welcome to Knoxville and wish you all the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you very much, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Without this lease and the ability to start up right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| you would not be hiring people to be working in Knox County until you had a site built, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| That's correct. In fact, the lease terms, as was mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| were a part of the incentive package proposed by the Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| and was a critical element in the decision to choose Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| Guys, I look at this company, if you know anything about them, they're a super company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| We're fortunate to have them in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| If we can use Summer Place to recruit companies that are going to bring $368,000 a year of jobs here to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1547)|
| 0:26:00| I'm not sure we need to be moving county people into that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| We may need to be using it this way more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| We may need to be using it this way more than to just house county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Commissioner Skinneker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess this is for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| In the lease, it says that there will be no parking provided at the Summer Place facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| so is PBA going to provide parking for them at Market Square Garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| State Street. They'll be at State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| We are full at Summer Place with KCS and UT, and I think Market Street's got like 10 spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1596)|
| 0:26:47| and it's a city garage, so they've got them at State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Commissioner Busland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I want to say thank you for coming to Knoxville and welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| The question is, you mentioned something about working from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| that you wouldn't be using the office spaces a lot, but they will work at home, son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| and work at your office building. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Yeah, it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| I mean, so culturally, our company has a philosophy that is based around working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| and the type of chemistry and synergy that comes from teams when you're co-located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| Obviously, when March of 2020 hit, we all needed to work from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| and so we did that pretty seamlessly. We're essentially built to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| As we move back into an office environment, we're trying to figure out the right balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| so that our members can have the right work-life balance, figure out home situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| and all the stuff that you want in order to maintain and engage your workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| And so we're going to be flexible in meeting them where they are as far as their needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| in order to work with us, yet at the same time come into the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| build a team atmosphere, and learn from each other. So it'll be a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Okay, so you are going to be hiring locally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| So typically our pattern is we hire, I mentioned college hires, so we'll do that from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| We'll also do it from other colleges and bring graduates in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| We'll hire on the open market from talent within the community that's experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and we'll also relocate into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| And so basically you get the benefit of all three types of hiring patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| in the way that we typically build our centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| Again, thank you for coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| I agree with Commissioner Smith that, yeah, if we can utilize that building to be an incubator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| for business and everything, that's fine, but we need a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| You know, we were told prior what the plan was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| We need an updated plan, and hopefully we can get that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| You know, I think all great plans go awry, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| And so when this opportunity presented itself, Mayor Jacobs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| I want this company here, and we're willing to do this to get them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| So he worked with the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| So we can come up with a plan for the rest of summer place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| but something like this would come along again, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| Summer place complex is how many square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Eighty-five thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| That's building and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| The office is 30 to 35, and the building is about 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| And they are going to occupy how many square feet of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| What do they got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| 7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| 7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Jane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| What is the amount of space in it that is leased already to existing leases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Excuse me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| The amount of space that's existing in existing leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| They are taking 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| And they're going to be leasing that to the existing leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| They are taking 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| And is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| But we already have a couple of leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| How much space are they taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Digital Crossing, who has black fiber and antennas on the roof, different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| In the building, they have 13,472 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Meta, they occupy 3,030 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| And they still have one entire floor that is not occupied at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| But as far as the plans going forward, this is really just the other two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| three leases were already accounted for in the plans going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| This is a minimum impact effect on our plans going forward with the available space we knew we would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| And I would add that CGI is making some enhancements to their space that they are paying for as tenant improvements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1868)|
| 0:31:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Well, I'd like to also say special thanks to Jane Burrett, Charlie Starkey in the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| and Morris Kaiser, who is the attorney for PBA, for working through this lease document with CGI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| And Mr. Labar, welcome to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| We're glad to support you and your efforts at CGI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Commissioner Smith, jump right back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| I was wondering if anybody would be open to a substitute motion to just go ahead and approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| so that the gentleman doesn't have to come back next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Commissioner Daley, you have the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Would you like to amend your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| I'll amend my motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Commissioner Lundy, would you like to amend your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Yes, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| We're now looking at an amended motion to approve item number 39, which will place it on consent next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| first by Commissioner Daley, second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Any opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Item number 40, resolution 902, is approving a contract with Convention Sports and Leisure International LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| in the amount of $57,500 plus reimbursable expenses for an economic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| of the downtown stadium project and adjacent developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker, second by Commissioner Bussner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Commissioner Daley, you pulled this off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1971)|
| 0:32:59| You and I had a discussion about where this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| I asked if this is really needed, this type of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| Of course, there's articles out there saying this is already a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Why should we be paying taxpayers, paying $57,000 plus expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=1993)|
| 0:33:24| Can you give a reason why we should be doing this study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2004)|
| 0:33:32| I've seen the Boyd Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| I've seen their slideshow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Have we seen their study that they've done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Can we get a copy of that study between now and ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| We can send you what they have shared with us on their economic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| Basically, we can't rely on Boyd Sports economic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| We have to do an independent economic impact study so we can verify with our own consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2038)|
| 0:34:06| not only the impact of the private development but also the impact on Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2046)|
| 0:34:15| This total study is $57,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2055)|

| 0:34:23| The reason this is coming before you all is we chose to use county procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| There was city and county representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| There's going to be some interesting things that come out of this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| First, the stadium is not a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| We meet once a week to go over contract stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| This will help us to know if the economic impact study that Mr. Boyd shared with us is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2086)|
| 0:34:59| Two, it gives us independent verification of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| Also, what it allows us to do is we're going to work with CGI to verify if the lease payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| that we have been talking about is a floor of a million dollars for a lease payment is market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2112)|
| 0:35:23| Is that market value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| If they come back and say, no, market rate is 1.2, then we can work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2125)|
| 0:35:35| Then we've paid $26,000 apiece maybe to increase our annual lease rent payment by $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2135)|
| 0:35:46| Definitely is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| You've got to have independent verification of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| It's just part of the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| As I sent you an email talking about the hiring of a CM, these are just the next steps in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| We've got to make sure that we are comfortable enough with our independent economic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| to still want to move ahead with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| How was the bid process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| How many answered the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| Matt has those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| I don't get involved in that because it can come to me as a protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| There were actually seven submittals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Three of those were late, so they were not looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| So they evaluated four total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| So going through the process, how did you choose this one company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2202)|
| 0:36:52| I can't think of the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| CSL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| There's evaluation criteria in the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| and each individual evaluator would evaluate those that we could, the four that we evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| They scored them, then they'd get together, talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| make sure that nobody missed something or didn't read whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| They'd come together, and we'd have the final scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| CSL was unanimously chosen by all three evaluators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| It had the highest score of all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| Who came up with all these questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Part of the packet stuck the procurement division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| It's question one, is the firm located in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Question two, then there's answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| That was, I believe, a joint effort between us and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Very good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| I mean, it answers a lot, and I did read all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| I guess, Chris, I guess the only thing that I would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| if Boardsports would turn it over to you, is at least some more of their study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| not just a slideshow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Mark, we've got their economic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| What have we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| If you could email that to us, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Hold on for one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Can you explain what we've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| It may not be full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| You would state your name and address for the record, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| It's good to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| I'm Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| Commissioner, we have the, they did two different reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| one of the stadium itself and their immediate development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| the $140 million or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| So we have the front summary part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| and then they also did a study of the overall area of what they believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| will be the developable lots around the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| So we have two different ones, and we definitely can provide you with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| we don't have all the data analysis behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| but we have the front part summaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| It's good, but certainly it's, of the firms that responded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| I don't know the firm that did Randy's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| I certainly think they're reputable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| But the ones that responded of the four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| I actually had reached out to a couple of underwriters that do extensive work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| in the sports stadium area of who they consider the best consultants in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| area, and three of the four were of the ones that submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| and the one that is the one that recommended was one of those that tends to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| be more on the municipal side than on the team side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| They tend to lean more toward doing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| representing communities to make sure you're getting the fair deal instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| representing the teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| And so that was one of their strengths, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| as they were looking at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Thank you, Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Thank you, Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Mr. Myers, did the value of this contract come in below what our procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2389)|
| 0:39:59| standards are for doing a request for a proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| I think the regulations say contracts are $100,000 and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| This one I believe is $57,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| and then there's expenses that could be paid on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| So we're not sure what that was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| I'm just being open and bringing it to you and let you know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| And I guess after hearing the gentleman from public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2422)|
| 0:40:30| did you all do any background checking on the company that was awarded the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| contract to look to see if they were tied too much to sports stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| themselves as opposed to being an independent Purdue University expert on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| stadiums and financing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| I wasn't directly involved in their evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| I can get more information, if need be, for next Monday on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| I'm sure there were references that were sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| and references are always checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| We do that from our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| I don't let everybody else do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| That way one person is calling and checking those references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Be glad to get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| I just want to know if it's possible to put a cap on reimbursable expenses not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| to exceed $7,500 or $10,000 or whatever is appropriate for this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2480)|
| 0:41:29| We'll be glad to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| I don't have the contract in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| But a lot of times it says that they must be pre-approved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| I just didn't want them to be like $10,000, $20,000 in reimbursable expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| Perhaps they could do an estimate before next week of what they anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| Sure will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Commissioner Bussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| How long will this take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| Nine to 12 weeks is what they're telling us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| How will this affect the development of that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| The development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| I mean, the stadium and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| I mean, you're putting it back another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| And I thought that they were wanting to be in the stadium in 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| I think the stadium is going to be operable in 2023 if everything gets done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| and the timeline stays fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| Nine to 12 weeks, we'll try to expedite that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| A lot of times we've seen that they'll put that out there and then beat that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| So the sooner we get it done, the sooner they get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| then the more we can study that and keep going in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| So will Commissioner Ward ask, will we have a cap price on that by next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| or will it be after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| We'll reach out to them and check on capping of the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Seeing no further discussion, we have a motion to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| without recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| with a second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Item number 41, Resolution 903,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| requesting the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| to waive certain provisions of the board's tax increment financing policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| and procedures and to prepare an economic impact plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| for a project to be known as Farragut Town Center at Biddle Farms Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Who is the first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Schoonmaker with Biggs on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Commissioner Smith, I see your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| I don't know who's here to answer these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| Is Bud here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| I'm well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| If you would state your name and address for the record, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| and speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Yes, I'm Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| And there's nobody from IDB or the Development Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| I guess I just wanted an explanation, and you and I have talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| this is a process that we normally don't go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| where we get a vote for anything on one of these kind of TIFs or pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| before it's been through UNICAP and analyzed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| and all the documents have been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| I guess just to explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| you're just here seeking a waiver of a rule that some say is antiquated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| on the amount of the recapture and the time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| and permission to move forward with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| That's partially correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| What I would really like is for that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| and to get a vote subject to satisfactory results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| from the outside independent consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| who we're probably going to use UNICAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| who has quite a bit of experience in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| But that's a pretty expensive process and a detailed process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| and we, looking through this, felt like it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| in discussions with the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| and some of the individual members of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| that it would make sense to make sure that this commission was on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| subject to satisfactory results from the outside independent study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2747)|
| 0:45:54| and any other staff people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| whether it be the Knox County engineer or public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| or any other comments or questions that maybe would need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| That confuses me a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Then you're asking us to approve the approval of a pilot or TIF on the front end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2767)|
| 0:46:16| It would be subject to the independent people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| in this case if it's UNICAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| coming back and answering satisfactorily the but for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| But for this TIF, this project would be financially unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Normally, the developer goes through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| and then comes and asks, here is the study and the but for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| Will you approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| By that time, we've usually got pretty good knowledge of what the project is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| what the costs are going to be, and how the whole process went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| This is where I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| What exactly are you asking us to do right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2821)|
| 0:47:09| This is kind of a unique situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| because it has to deal with the rules of commission on pilots and TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| I'll let Mark explain this, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| He knows it a lot better than myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| and he can explain what you're trying to approve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Mark Mabentoff again, still at 1215 Great Oaks Way in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| Commissioner Smith, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| This whole TIF will come back to you all as an economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| You will have the opportunity to vote whether to approve a tax increment financing incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| for this project at some future date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| Mr. Cullum came to the county and said, look, I've already done the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| I know that based on the limitations in the existing IDB policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| the math will not work for my project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| So I don't want to spend $10,000 or so on muni-cap and fees to the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| if I know ahead of time the math doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| I'm speaking for Bud right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| I'm asking you guys to be willing to consider my plan when it comes back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| but not subject to these limitations that are in the existing IDB policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| but based on the merits that the third-party review will show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| He's basically saying, please do this ahead of time so that I know whether I'm wasting my money or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| because I know I'm wasting my money is what I'm sure Bud would tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| He's nodding for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| If you have limitations that are in the existing IDB policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Yes, that makes a lot more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| We're not approving the project overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| We're just approving the exception to the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Pencil hasn't been put to paper on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| He will be back with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| At that time, we can discuss more of the merits of is this what Farragut needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| is this what TIFs and pilots are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| By state law, there will be a public hearing in front of the IDB that people can come and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| I think this is a dumb idea or a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| and then it will come to you guys with the results of that public hearing at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Bud, can you give us a history of your project, what you're wanting to do, where it's located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| what you would use this TIF for, because I've had a few conversations with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| Yes, and I actually have some things that we could hand out to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| They're fairly brief, but it's a pretty good, gives you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| I'm not going to want to read every bit of it as you sit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| but I can kind of go through it, and I can walk you through it probably in four or five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| If that's acceptable, if we could hand those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Let's answer some more questions while that's being done, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| Yeah, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Just go ahead and give us the brief history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Okay, so essentially the property as it exists, part of the property was a former Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| It was the first Kroger that was developed in the town of Farragut right about 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| maybe a little over 40 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Kroger relocated somewhat across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| The building has sat essentially vacant for the past approximately 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| Obviously when a building is vacant for that long, it shows that age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| In discussions with the town of Farragut over the last probably 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| we started out looking at the idea of creating a town center type project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| We finally morphed into saying we need a multifamily component to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| We contracted with the Biddle family to purchase more additional land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| Behind the old Kroger, as I refer to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| and through many, many public hearings before the Farragut Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| and the Board of Mayor and Aldermen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| ultimately we came to a plan that we're very excited about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| and we call it a horizontal mixed-use development versus a vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| A vertical mixed-use generally has a structured parking component to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| because of financial issues and various other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| That was not an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| but we have come up with something that will include a town center park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| We have done probably close to $100,000 worth of hydrology studies at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| There have been ongoing existing issues with flooding during heavy rain events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3100)|
| 0:51:49| in some of that area, really for the history of the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| Our studies have shown that part of that issue was because two FEMA maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| came together in that particular area, and looking back and studying those maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| I realize I'm getting into the weeds, and I apologize, but they were wrong, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| So with doing construction work and the hydrology studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| we will be submitting to FEMA for what's known as a map revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| Most of the work can begin before we receive that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| Generally those take about 6 to 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| but if you've had the hydrology studies done that show that it will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| generally you always end up getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| We will be building new roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| We will have to do a new bridge to help some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| but in a nutshell we will actually be improving flooding conditions upstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| which is a big thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| The town of Farragut, through a lot of discussion, has agreed to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| Obviously they don't have a property tax, so they can't be part of a pilot or a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| but several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| One, we have what will be kind of a, as we call it, the town square, the park area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| and several other roads that the town of Farragut has agreed to accept these roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| where in a typical situation they probably would force us to keep those private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| The town's also agreed to put in probably, we haven't got an exact number on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| but probably an additional half million dollars toward other public facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| as a part of this town green facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| And some of the studies that we have done as far as doing an estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3221)|
| 0:53:48| say over the 20-year life of the TIF that I'm asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| the town of Farragut would probably be close to a million dollars in expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| in maintaining this town green and the roads that we will be dedicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| The packet that you have has one page that shows a plan view of the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| and it has green highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| In that green highlight, that highlighted area is what will be publicly owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| by the town of Farragut and maintained by the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| There's also some, we've done engineering studies that show that a lot of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3262)|
| 0:54:30| that we're doing could be considered public improvements, both from helping with the floods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| doing the park, doing the other utilities and public roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| that really would amount to potentially about $8 million based on the engineers' takeoff on the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| What we are asking for in total would be a $6 million TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| and in order to justify the numbers for that, it does require a 20-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| and using 100% of the increment instead of only 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| I do want to point out that it's a little bit of a misnomer, and if I say this wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| I don't know if Mark's still here, he can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| but even though we're asking for 100% of the increment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| there's still a policy where we have to earmark for the county debt service budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| And that is shown in the packets that you have where we've analyzed the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| So at build-out, even though you're still holding off on the increment during the life of the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| the calculations show that it's still adding an additional approximately $140,000 in tax from day one after build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3335)|
| 0:55:45| So it's a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Commissioner Skinneker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Mr. Collum, thank you for coming here this evening to give us the packet and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| For my colleagues who might not be familiar with this property, Mr. Collum did mention the Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| but this is really a blighted property in West Knox County, and it's not just a single entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| It's actually a strip center that's L-shaped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| so you can imagine how many businesses in that L-shaped quadrant are unoccupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| In fact, I guess five or six years ago when somebody bought the leases on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| they failed to remember that when wintertime comes, you need to turn the water off because pipes will freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| So all of those extra little spaces, you can see where the ceiling caved in because of all the water that came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3397)|
| 0:56:47| But anyways, this is just a fabulous project for Farragut and West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| and I appreciate my colleagues who signed on as co-sponsors of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| Commissioner Busler, you're up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair. How many acres is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| There's three different pieces to the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| There's a lot of property that we will be purchasing that's in the flood zone that we can't touch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| but the part that we will be actually developing is about 45 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| So the whole area that you're developing is how many acres, 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| About 45 acres, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Well, I hope you succeed. We had a property out in my neck of the woods that only had 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| and we could never get it to work, so I hope you succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| Mr. Cone, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| I saw in the Farragut contributions that they're talking about town center public parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| or public park, restroom facility, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| I'm interested to see what your take is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| You know, Farragut High School is very close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| What about the walkability to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| I'm looking forward to seeing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| And the town of Farragut, and I'm going to – don't hold me to this because it doesn't really have anything to do with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| but I know that they have been planning, and Mr. Schoonmaker may know a whole lot more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| but they've been studying the idea of a tunnel under Kingston Pike and a couple other ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| and Commissioner Schoonmaker, could you shed any more light on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| Well, I think there's a lot of discussion in the preliminary stages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| but as you know, the town of Farragut is very park friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| and so they believe in walkability from their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| So I don't think there's anything in concrete yet to get through this process first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| but they are definitely looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| This will be, I hope, sets kind of the tone of things that we can do all across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| We've talked about multi-use for years, and hopefully you set it up and we knock it out of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| Thank you for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Thank you for your kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Mr. Kumher, I've just got a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| Of the $8.25 million worth of what's labeled public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| all of those are contained upon the 45 acres that will be developed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| So there's no improvement to any of the surrounding roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| I shouldn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| We are changing Brooklawn, which is currently a town of Farragut Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| so that would be considered off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| There is an area on property that is not owned by us that fronts on Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| where, per the hydrology study, we will have to be filling and making improvements to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| of which we have the agreement with the landowner that owns that to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| So from that context, I guess there are off-site improvements being done also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| But most of the flood containment is designed for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| When you say a bridge to help with upstream flood control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| is that an existing bridge that goes to the land now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| We have to tear out an existing bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| There's a 40-year-plus street or driveway, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| that was built for the original Kroger development that connected to Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| And that road, not only will that bridge have to be torn out and that road totally redone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| but then that will become one of the roads that Farragut will own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| But we have to do a whole new bridge up to today's standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| And these on-site roads that you'll be building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| was it requested by you or the town of Farragut to become responsible for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| It was requested by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3656)|

| 1:00:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Seeing no further discussion on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| there is a motion to approve this which would put it onto the consent calendar next week by Commissioner Skinnemaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| seconded by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3673)|

| 1:01:17| Good luck with your project, sir, and it will be on consent next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3677)|

| 1:01:23| Item number 42, Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| It's a resolution to subsidize the monthly parking fee for Knox County employees who park in the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| and Dwight Castle garages effective July 1st, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| First by Commissioner Skinnemaker to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Commissioner Skinnemaker, you pulled this off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| I just wanted to give Mayor Jacobs the opportunity to say what a great idea this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| And at the same time, I'd like to see if any of my colleagues would like to sign on as co-sponsors to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3716)|
| 1:02:08| Commissioner Beeler raises his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| If you want to sign on, just put your hand up and we'll make a note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| One, two, three, four, five, six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Looks like everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| If you would, sir, just give us your name and your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I'm Glenn Jacobs, Knox County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Thank you, Commissioner Skinnemaker, and thank you for bringing this to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| You know, one of the things about Knox County, the government, is we have folks that work in different parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| And we didn't think that it's fair that if you work out there, you don't have to pay for parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| where if you come down to the city, county, building, or Dwight Coastal Garage, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| As well as, unfortunately, as an employer, we can't control some expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| You know, and we're seeing increases in things like health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| We can't do anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| So this is just a way that we can show the employees that we do care about them, that they are valued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| and hopefully can offset, unfortunately, some rising costs that they're seeing in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| So thank you all for consideration on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| Mr. Mayor, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| I know Commissioner Skinnemaker and you worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| I'm very proud that you worked it out and got it because $44 a month, I think it's $44, that's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3804)|
| 1:03:33| That's about $500 a year, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| That's a lot for the associates that we have in Goss County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| And I just want to say thank you and thank you for Commissioner Skinnemaker for coming up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| And I would be honored to sign on to it if you would accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you again, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| I guess I'm going to ask this question for the law director on behalf of myself and Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3833)|
| 1:04:02| Being people who work in the building, is there a conflict there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| My understanding of the conflict is if it were something individually for a person, it would be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| But seeing how this affects all county employees within the building, is it a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| I don't see any conflict, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| I want to thank Commissioner Skinnemaker and the mayor for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| We talk about equity and pay, and as the mayor pointed out, someone can be on the same step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| same grade as another employee somewhere within Knox County that works at EPW,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| the libraries, the health department, North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| And essentially they're making as much of a half to a percent or even greater than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| more than the employee whose job happens to be located in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| So on behalf of all the employees that work in the building, I thank both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| We have a proper motion and a second to approve item number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3911)|

| 1:05:23| It's a resolution dissolving the Knox County Committee on Health and Economic Well-Being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Seconded by Commissioner Ward, first by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| Discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| We're on 44, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| We're on 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| I don't think I had 44 pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3958)|

| 1:06:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3960)|
| 1:06:09| So the committee was going to put on their agenda to dissolve, to recommend to us to dissolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| A couple of them reached out to me, and I just went ahead and put it on here to dissolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| This way, we didn't have to jump through hoops, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| Is there other discussion on item 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| The motion was to approve, is that correct, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| We have approval and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4001)|

| 1:07:02| In General, to add a new section 2.2-7 entitled Public Notices to provide for all public notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| of a Knox County government to be posted on a public notice website that is established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| and maintained by the Knox County Department of Information Technology, and to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| a public notice that is required by law to be published in a newspaper of general circulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| to be published in a non-subscription-based newspaper of general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| This amends Knox County Code, chapter 2, article 1, establishing section 2-7, previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Go ahead, Mr. Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| First by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| Open the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| So the State House and the State Senate passed a similar bill on this last session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| It was voted almost unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| There's only one person in the Senate that voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| This is basically to kind of take us forward into the next generation of technology and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| streamlining everything, so this is to build a foundation for a website for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| to post all of our future notifications there, and then hopefully talking to some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| counterparts at the state level, there'll be more legislation coming down next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| to be able to even streamline more county-level things to this website so that eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| within probably, we're thinking the next year or two, all of our notifications will be housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| on one website for more transparency so that the citizens can go to one spot that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| control and kind of streamline it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| So that's the mentality behind this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| Is there additional discussion on item number 48?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| This is a first reading, so it would be moved forward next week without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| If it passed next week, it would be on the June agenda on a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| So it's time to continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| Okay, seeing none, we have a proper first and a second to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| I'll just sort of take a gauge of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| I believe we only have one more item, and it's a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Do we want to take a break, or do we want to power on and be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| Power on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Power on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| It's item 49, discussion item regarding zonings of adding churches in the shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| commercial, light industrial, and industrial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| Commissioner Dale, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Since I've seen Mr. Snowden leave and Amy's, Director Brooks, is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| we might want to move this to next week, but the reason, just real quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| the reason I brought this forward is that we've got a lot of big box stores now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| that are being empty, and churches are starting to take those big box stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| Our zoning is outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| We need to generate from this commission to ask Knoxville-North County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| to look at the zoning to add churches as a use in the commercial, light industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4215)|
| 1:10:23| and even the heavy industrial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Right now, they've got to go through the whole process of having it rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| and everything that you've put in there, and we need to solve a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| I've had three in my neighborhood, or my district, and I'm sure there's been others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| But we might want to finish this up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| I agree with Commissioner Daley that there's a change in demand for our strip centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| and our commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| One thing, we've had these discussions before a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| One thing we have to be wary of in the strip mall center setting is if you let a church move in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4262)|
| 1:11:10| we need our zoning to also say that a restaurant that serves alcohol can move next to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| and not forbid, because of our current laws on the selling of alcoholic beverages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| in a way that we don't eliminate all the possibilities that could happen in that shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| But I'm sure we can work that in, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| I imagine the property, if a church were to also buy a strip center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| then we would obviously lose property tax revenue on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| and would that cover the owner of the strip center and all the tenants there underneath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| or as a non-profit entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| He'd probably be the expert on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| If I may, Mr. Chairman, I don't believe it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| If they were not using it for their tax exempt religious purposes, it would not be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| It would just be their portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| But I'm all for giving the opportunity for churches to be in these locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| I just don't want it to prohibit other people from being able to start businesses in adjoining properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| That was a discussion that we had with Amy and also with Jim that we have to watch to be careful with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| I do know that in my neighborhood, Severe Heights bought the strip mall that had a package store in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| The package store, I don't think, I'm not saying that they had to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| because the liquor rules are a little different from beer rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| So I think they moved because the church didn't extend their lease, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4364)|
| 1:12:52| As the owner of the property, they have the right to do that, pick their tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| I'm just worried about, in a lot of places you have churches that don't go in and actually buy the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| they just lease from-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| Right, and the beer board rules would prohibit that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| Would prohibit somebody being within, I think it's 300 feet of opening up a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| The process for it, if you don't know the process, we will initiate a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| It will go to planning. Planning will look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| It will go to the 15 planning commissioners to have their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| Then it will come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| So hopefully during all that vetting, we can come up with a good answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| If it pleases Commissioner Daley and the other commissioners, we have a massive agenda next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| I might suggest that maybe, I don't see any objections to going down this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| that maybe you, if everybody's agreeable to it, to just initiate requests from planning to begin working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| and not have it carry over as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| I fear we're going to be here until the wee hours anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| Mr. Law Director, can we do that verbally or do we need to, just to make a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| You can make a request of MPC to do a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| I mean, offhand, that is a problem raised over here about shutting down businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4446)|
| 1:14:17| I'll look at that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| I mean, you can work that into an amendment whereby it doesn't shut down a beer store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| I would like to request, if you would, Law Director, is to go ahead and check into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| and send a letter on behalf that we look into at these zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| We'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| I believe that any individual, and it may not be that way now, I may not have changed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| but I believe any individual or any commissioner can go to Knox County, Knox Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| and request an ordinance zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| They can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| So I believe you can do that, and if it's okay, I'll not carry this item over to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| I'll get a hold of Director Brooks and let's not carry it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1462-210517?start=4505)|
