| 2:25:37| when he has no assurance he will be able to put the proposed development on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8737)|
| 2:25:44| There is nothing to stop the opposition from opposing the use on review, appeal it, if necessary, to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8744)|
| 2:25:53| subsequently appeal, if they care to, into the judicial system where time kills that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8753)|
| 2:26:00| Don't those operating in good faith on zoning classifications that permit a proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8760)|
| 2:26:09| have the right to expect they can so use their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| I've got a lot more that I can say about this and a lot more I can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| I've got page after page of notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| And I know you all have been provided some history and a booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| Within that booklet, in the section 2009, about halfway through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| you'll see a photograph of the proposed car wash that we talked about originally that was going to go over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8791)|
| 2:26:41| Now, not going there, but going to go over here on this parcel, this parcel being the 9201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8801)|
| 2:26:50| That's what was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8810)|
| 2:26:55| There's also in there, I think, a smaller version of this map that you can refer to as to the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8815)|
| 2:27:03| One other point, and this is purely a procedural matter that Mr. Donaldson alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8823)|
| 2:27:09| you have one application for plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8829)|
| 2:27:14| Depending on what you do on the zoning, the plan amendments have to, if you will, be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8834)|
| 2:27:24| They are or will be different depending on what you do on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8844)|
| 2:27:31| The observation that they had a little glitch and one parcel, which is 9205, was omitted from approval of a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8851)|
| 2:27:43| I suggest to you there's a rather nice, neat problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8863)|
| 2:27:48| One application for a plan amendment and it was on there, yet at the motion it was not included and is omitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8868)|
| 2:27:56| and yet you're now here looking at talking about rezoning that piece of property when there hasn't been a plan amendment approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8876)|
| 2:28:04| He thinks they can get that done before your second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8884)|
| 2:28:10| It's on MPC's agenda for Thursday of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| I don't believe it will be here in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| There's sort of a little, if you will, swamp out there that is raised because of that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8900)|
| 2:28:28| I don't know whether it is in a posture where you can really go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8908)|
| 2:28:38| There's one application for the plan amendments and one application for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8918)|
| 2:28:46| And we've already, if you will, got them in enough of a convoluted position by dealing with them as three different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8926)|
| 2:28:53| If we start saying, well, okay, we're going to take out one of these pieces that are currently in the application for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8933)|
| 2:29:01| and hold it until some point later in time when the plan amendment has been approved that potentially deals with it, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8941)|
| 2:29:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8950)|
| 2:29:11| I just say that's a procedural issue that's got to be dealt with somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8951)|
| 2:29:20| I would hope that we have opportunity to further answer and or respond to any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8960)|
| 2:29:28| I've taken more time than I probably should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| I guess I ought to yield to some of the others who have an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| Before you leave, Mr. King, I thought I understood and maybe I misunderstood when Mr. Donaldson was speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8973)|
| 2:29:40| and then you spoke that the uses you wanted on that track, for lack of a better term, on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8980)|
| 2:29:47| south of Washington Pike, the 9207 and the one adjoining it, of a restaurant and, what did you say, a liquor store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8987)|
| 2:29:57| that those uses were permitted uses under the zoning change that's been recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8997)|
| 2:30:04| and your objection is simply that you don't want to go through the expense of submitting the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9004)|
| 2:30:10| to see if the setbacks and the lighting and all those things conform to some design criteria that are being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9010)|
| 2:30:17| In other words, am I confused or are those uses that are allowed subject to some review of your plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9017)|
| 2:30:24| to make sure of the adequacy of protection of the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| Well, that last one I'll deal with as a second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| Okay, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| First of all, currently, zoned as it currently is, as a permitted use for a restaurant and a liquor store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9035)|
| 2:30:47| you would submit your request for a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9047)|
| 2:30:51| and that would then be determined whether or not you were within compliance of all of the subdivision rigs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| and getting all your engineering approvals, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| What this proposed change or this proposed rezoning does is add, yes, it's still a possible use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9063)|
| 2:31:15| but it has to go through a use on review subject to the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| and conditions for approval and or denial of a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| And, in addition, there are other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| And, you know, it's an educational process that some of us have been a long time going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9089)|
| 2:31:39| but you deal with a use on review in addition to the conditions that are proposed as part of this zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9099)|
| 2:31:49| Additionally, conditions can be imposed through the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9109)|
| 2:31:55| and, ultimately, the use on review process may result in either a denial of your proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9115)|
| 2:32:03| or an approval of your proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| And what I'm saying to you is, in the development of property, take a .8 acre piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9126)|
| 2:32:13| and you want to do a development on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| There is only, you know, there's a finite point at which front end costs indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9135)|
| 2:32:25| or pretty much dictate that you don't need to be fooling with this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| It would be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| Use on review has a legitimate place when you're dealing with planned commercial properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| which are larger tracts, shopping center properties, which are larger tracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9158)|
| 2:32:43| You load in additional costs on less than an acre of property for doing some sort of a commercial development on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9163)|
| 2:32:52| and it just goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| And that's why we say what happens here is loading in those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9174)|
| 2:33:01| and I've enumerated some of the expense involved and what's going to take place there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| adds to the overall cost for the development of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| It can only bear so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| So it's the front end cost that you're talking about, not that the use is permitted per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9192)|
| 2:33:18| No, it's all a factor of getting it developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| Why should my client have any incentive to try to go forward with developing this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9201)|
| 2:33:27| if he's done everything he's supposed to do up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| in reliance on a letter that he has from MPC that was done in September of 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9211)|
| 2:33:39| that says that this piece of property is Zone C3 and it permits a car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9219)|
| 2:33:52| And we know that this piece over here, it currently permits the development of a restaurant and liquor store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9232)|
| 2:33:59| when now all of a sudden the rule has changed and, well, you may be able to put a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9239)|
| 2:34:05| and a liquor store on it after you do a bunch more stuff to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| And I just say to you, Mr. DelVolpe, you said it earlier, I'm going to paraphrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9250)|
| 2:34:18| and you were talking about what the city and the sign issue was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9258)|
| 2:34:23| In my view, fair is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| And we had a person here who spent a substantial sum of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9266)|
| 2:34:30| in trying to develop a piece of property that currently permits his proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9270)|
| 2:34:38| and what keeps happening is the bubble of mercury keeps moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9278)|
| 2:34:45| And it's to the point where he or anybody else would have serious doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9285)|
| 2:34:52| or serious concern about whether they're ever going to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9292)|
| 2:34:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9297)|
| 2:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9298)|
| 2:34:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9299)|
| 2:35:00| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| I want to ask you about the car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| And I think I understand you to say that if your client cannot get the car wash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9307)|
| 2:35:14| in addition to the liquor store and the restaurant, he doesn't really want to proceed any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9314)|
| 2:35:20| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9320)|
| 2:35:21| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9321)|
| 2:35:22| What I said was my client wants to be able to develop that piece of property, 9207.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9322)|
| 2:35:32| I believe I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| 9201 is the one on the corner of Murphy and Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| Then this piece here next to the Weigels is 9207.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9337)|
| 2:35:42| My client wants to develop that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| He has a substantial investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| He owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| He's bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| He wants to put that development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| He can at least recoup some of his expense that he has incurred already on that property to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9350)|
| 2:35:56| On this piece, that is the 9201, what I said was if this proposed zoning, as it came out of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9356)|
| 2:36:08| if it is adopted, my client's interest in that piece of property will no longer exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9368)|
| 2:36:15| He had a contract on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| The bank foreclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| He no longer has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| But he would be willing to acquire it if he were sure he could use the car wash on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9382)|
| 2:36:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9390)|
| 2:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| Mr. Kline or Mr. Shanks, whoever is going to go next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| Go ahead, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9401)|
| 2:36:42| Wayne Kline, 617 Main Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| I'm here representing National Bank of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| Right over there is Mr. Bill Newman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| He's from the National Bank of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| Put your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| I asked him to come tonight because National Bank of Tennessee has taken a great interest in this property because it had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9416)|
| 2:37:02| It had to foreclose on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| Let me tell you what property it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9424)|
| 2:37:05| It's these mustered three lots here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| We're talking about lots 84, 85, and 85.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| Now, these are on the north side of Washington Pike, and these are part of the four lots together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9432)|
| 2:37:21| That's that blue lot that Mr. King was just talking about that Mr. Cates had an interest in until the MPC did what it did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9441)|
| 2:37:29| and the bank foreclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| The point that I want to add to Mr. King's discussion is that the bank was foreclosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9453)|
| 2:37:42| had to foreclose on this property because Mr. Jernigan, who had the property before, couldn't make the payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9462)|
| 2:37:48| And what's going to happen because the bank is not in the development of property business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9468)|
| 2:37:55| is that if the C3 zone, which is on there presently and which was placed on there after it was annexed in the city in August of 07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9475)|
| 2:38:08| and then MPC in June of 08 made the recommendation that the closest zone for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9488)|
| 2:38:16| which is what's required once a property is annexed in the city, would be C3 with no conditions on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9496)|
| 2:38:23| then this body put a C3 zone without restrictions, without any conditions on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9503)|
| 2:38:30| And that's the property that the bank lent upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9510)|
| 2:38:35| That's the property that the bank got back and has now with C3 presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9515)|
| 2:38:41| And that's the property, part of the property, that this council said, MPC, we want you to do a mini sector plan study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9521)|
| 2:38:49| And when the MPC came back with a recommendation after this plan study, it was not, the bank didn't participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9529)|
| 2:38:58| Victor Jernigan didn't participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9538)|
| 2:39:00| But what happened was when the bank got these three lots, it has to get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9540)|
| 2:39:06| It's not in the business of developing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| And as Mr. King just told you about Dr. Cates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9549)|
| 2:39:13| if the restrictions that the MPC has recommended are placed on this property, the bank is going to be foreclosed from selling the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9553)|
| 2:39:23| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| Nobody's interested in coming and buying property and developing small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| Now, look, we're talking about less than an acre, 0.8, 0.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9568)|
| 2:39:32| One is 1.02 or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| You can't get a Walgreens, you can't get any developer to come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9575)|
| 2:39:42| we'll take the risk, we'll get an option, we'll develop a plan, we'll put all the money in the upfront costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9582)|
| 2:39:48| and we'll take a risk that the use on review will be successful through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9588)|
| 2:39:55| And then if that all works, we'll purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| It doesn't happen with small properties like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| And so the conditions that the MPC is attempting to enforce or asking you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9601)|
| 2:40:08| or recommending you to enforce on this C3 zone for these three properties, make the properties unsaleable by the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9608)|
| 2:40:17| And what you can do is stick the bank with these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| They can't sell it, what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| I do know that those that are interested in the property want the C3 without the conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9623)|
| 2:40:29| and with conditions are not interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| And so just like Dr. Cates says, if this property is zone C3 without the conditions, he has a retained interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9632)|
| 2:40:41| so are the potential developers who are talking to the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9641)|
| 2:40:47| So simply put, we're asking you to maintain the C3 zone that you placed on these properties two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9647)|
| 2:40:57| and not put any conditions on it that include a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9657)|
| 2:41:01| that would put the kind of financial burden on a potential developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| that can't be sustained by the costs associated with developing small parcels such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9666)|
| 2:41:14| I think the most important thing, generically, globally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| is that we have, I think, already a chilling effect on development in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| And to place conditions such as this, such as are recommended by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| on these three parcels would further that chilling effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| and you would have no good development, no development at all on these parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9692)|
| 2:41:37| including all four of them, I must say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| I'm speaking on behalf of all four of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| How'd I do, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9705)|
| 2:41:46| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| Mr. Klein, before you leave, you seem to exclude that 9201, the one in blue that's in that northern section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9707)|
| 2:41:53| Doesn't the bank have all four of those tracts, and it's about 6.4 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| No, sir. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| You only have the three, and someone else has the blue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9721)|
| 2:42:02| I thought that was interest of Mr. King's client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| but he had a contract that dissolved when you foreclosed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| That is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9728)|
| 2:42:09| Tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9729)|
| 2:42:10| No, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9730)|
| 2:42:11| Who owns the tract now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| This is Home Federal Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| Okay, a third bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| I represent National Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| They're coming next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9736)|
| 2:42:17| The third bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9737)|
| 2:42:18| Coming next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9739)|
| 2:42:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9740)|
| 2:42:21| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| Move to the microphone if you're going to do that, or use the one in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9746)|
| 2:42:32| I want to make one point about your description of the size of the totality of those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9752)|
| 2:42:38| Understand that, and I just put a letter in, that the building footprint on each of those is considerably smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9758)|
| 2:42:46| There's a stream to the back of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| You've got a 75-foot setback from that stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| On this corner piece, that right there is a 150-foot wide power line easement under which nothing can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9770)|
| 2:43:01| The building footprint for this piece over here is about 0.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| Thank you, but that existed with the time you guys made the loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| That's not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| That's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| Another recommendation is to put only two driveways to access all of the potential commercial property on all four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9793)|
| 2:43:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| That was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9803)|
| 2:43:24| You see the obvious problem with that, and that is you have four independent lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| To put two driveways, that forces whoever owns those properties to work in a manner that's probably unsolvable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9808)|
| 2:43:39| especially if ownership changes to the lots and to the commercial businesses placed on the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9819)|
| 2:43:46| Business people can't work together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9826)|
| 2:43:49| That's not what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| What I'm saying is if you have an independent business on this lot, and there's an access here and here or here and here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9832)|
| 2:44:00| you're forced then to either purchase or find a way for ingress and egress onto your business property with another property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9840)|
| 2:44:11| Vice Mayor, that is an improper condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| That is an arbitrary and capricious placement of a condition on these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9855)|
| 2:44:22| The same person owns them, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| The bank owns them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| There are four independent parcels now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| Well, but three of them are owned by one bank, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| The three in the mustard are owned by my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| Okay. All right. Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| And your client could potentially work with itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| My client is not prepared, nor does it have the ability to develop businesses on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| And you can't sell them together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| I can't sell them together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9887)|
| 2:44:48| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| It sounded like so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| Let me ask another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| You talked a little while ago about – and my back hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| That's why I'm standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| You talked a while about regardless of all these conditions, there's a chilling effect on development in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| I'd like to hear more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| What's this chilling effect on development in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| The chilling effect is that we're having a hard time developing businesses in the city, particularly on small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9909)|
| 2:45:15| And if you put conditions on the lots that make it further more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9915)|
| 2:45:21| then you're going to have a problem selling those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| What's the effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9926)|
| 2:45:27| What's the – you're saying it's hard to develop a small lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9927)|
| 2:45:31| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| I'm saying that if you have a C-3, a lot, let's say, that's .7 acres, and you want to sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9932)|
| 2:45:38| and it's a Zone C-3 without any restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| it's, I think, accessible for potential financing for a bank to finance a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9941)|
| 2:45:51| that can be accepted on the C-3 zone without a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9951)|
| 2:45:56| But when you put a use on review and then potential restrictions on ingress and egress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9956)|
| 2:46:01| and you subject that potential application to a use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| and then a city council process, you are adding costs, time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9966)|
| 2:46:12| that make it impossible for development on small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9972)|
| 2:46:17| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9978)|
| 2:46:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| Mr. Shanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9980)|
| 2:46:26| Here's your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9986)|
| 2:46:27| Greg Shanks, 406 Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| I'm the attorney for Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9989)|
| 2:46:30| First, let me apologize for my casual dress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| I didn't become aware of this issue until about five-something, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9992)|
| 2:46:38| Let me also try to set the record straight just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| It was intimated accidentally that my client is Home Federal but owns this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10001)|
| 2:46:48| We have owned it for less than three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| We did not foreclose because these conditions were imposed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10012)|
| 2:46:57| We foreclosed because no payments were being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| and there were no prospects of any payments being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| I suspect that maybe Home Federal had deferred foreclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| to see whether Dr. Cate's contract may have gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| But our foreclosure was no kind of retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10029)|
| 2:47:13| Home Federal is as good a corporate citizen as there is in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10033)|
| 2:47:16| and we would never do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10036)|
| 2:47:24| Probably to reiterate what some people have said is this situation is based on a false premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| and that there's one owner of all these pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| As we've gone over, there's actually now there's two owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| Home Federal owns this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| National Bank of Tennessee owns these three pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| which, you know, since they're not developers, they'd probably like to stay as three pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| We've got two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10064)|
| 2:47:49| But within what you're asking for is within the piece that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10069)|
| 2:47:54| and these three pieces that we only get two driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10074)|
| 2:47:57| And, yes, we can work together and we've worked together time and time again with a whole lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10077)|
| 2:48:02| but the pragmatics are you can't sell a piece of property unless somebody's guaranteed that they're going to have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10082)|
| 2:48:10| And, you know, if we try to sell this with no guarantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| we've got to have an absolute guarantee that there's access to that property or nobody's going to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| That's just the practical effect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| You know, working together or not, it's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10100)|
| 2:48:25| That's my biggest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| You know, the other concerns, these other three conditions, I'm not all that concerned about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10106)|
| 2:48:31| Like I said, Home Federal is a good corporate citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| We've worked with structures like that before, built dozens of branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10113)|
| 2:48:37| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| The problem is we don't want to get stuck with a piece of property that's got no driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10118)|
| 2:48:46| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10126)|
| 2:48:47| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10127)|
| 2:48:48| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10128)|
| 2:48:49| Any questions for Mr. Shanks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| Mr. Wolfenbarger or Mr. Murphy, whichever one wants to come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| I'm Bob Wolfenbarger, 3200 Lexington Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| and I'm speaking on behalf of the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association and NETCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10139)|
| 2:49:04| which is in the county, but it's a neighborhood organization most of you are familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10144)|
| 2:49:09| But I think I can say all this pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| First of all, thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| It's late, and we almost want to apologize for asking counsel to look at this issue to save us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10157)|
| 2:49:26| I think these gentlemen have already made my point that this thing is absolutely in disarray and out of hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10166)|
| 2:49:32| because Mr. Jernigan made a lot of promises to a lot of people that he can't deliver on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10172)|
| 2:49:36| and there's no disrespect to him intended in saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| And that's why we had city council ask MPC to look at this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10179)|
| 2:49:45| and try to figure out a way to get the city's handle on it and the community's handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10185)|
| 2:49:51| And we, the neighborhood, think that MPC staff made the right decision when they recommended SC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10191)|
| 2:50:02| If there's any constraints on these properties whereby these folks can't use this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| that's what the Board of Zoning Appeals is for, and the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10207)|
| 2:50:10| if I am denied reasonable use of my land, they have to give it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10210)|
| 2:50:15| So we support the staff recommendation that Mr. Donaldson referred to because it's the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10215)|
| 2:50:25| and it gives everybody a sense of equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10229)|
| 2:50:32| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10232)|
| 2:50:36| Hello. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| I just, again, want to actually thank counsel for taking this matter up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| I think there's been a lot of good discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10243)|
| 2:50:47| I've tried to organize a couple of meetings of homeowners associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10247)|
| 2:50:50| and neighborhood associations in the area while MPC was going through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| We got those advertised in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10253)|
| 2:50:56| Everybody that I've spoken to at those meetings, I can't say we took a poll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| but everybody that I spoke to likes this idea of moving to something where there is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| sort of a planned use review requirement in there, whether it be SC1 or the recommendation that MPC passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10264)|
| 2:51:11| because this is a transition area, it's a sensitive area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| and there is property adjacent that my family owns and that I own that's historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10274)|
| 2:51:21| and that we're actually looking at historical zoning overlays and conservation easements on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10281)|
| 2:51:25| So we think that the plan review allows some modicum of trying to work that transition successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10285)|
| 2:51:32| to preserve the beauty in the area of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| So I just want to thank you for taking this under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10298)|
| 2:51:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10299)|
| 2:51:40| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10300)|
| 2:51:41| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10301)|
| 2:51:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10302)|
| 2:51:43| I think it's important that maybe for us that have been here in our second term now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10303)|
| 2:51:48| and for the new members to kind of walk through how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10308)|
| 2:51:53| As I recall, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Murphy, you can step down, that Mr. Murphy came to us at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10313)|
| 2:52:00| and Mr. Donaldson, you may recall this better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| but Mr. Murphy came to us at public forum at the end of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10323)|
| 2:52:08| and recommended that we look at this planned use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10328)|
| 2:52:12| and Councilman Frost asked you, the NPC, to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10332)|
| 2:52:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| Following the discussion at public forum, there was actually a resolution placed on the following meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10340)|
| 2:52:25| which initiated our look at a general rezoning in the area with a firm look at using PC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10345)|
| 2:52:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10355)|
| 2:52:36| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| And I'd like to just talk about Mr. Jernigan just a minute because a lot of us went to a lot of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10358)|
| 2:52:44| and I think he spent a lot of time and money to try to work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10364)|
| 2:52:49| and to communicate with the community and work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10369)|
| 2:52:53| And I felt like things were going very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| And he had the support of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| And we all know the financial situation that we're in and the way the economy is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10378)|
| 2:53:03| and so things have happened that are unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| But as I see this, you know, I really can't support this because I don't think that you can unilaterally go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10387)|
| 2:53:18| and change the zoning or add a variety of conditions or restrictions simply because the ownership changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10398)|
| 2:53:29| And that, you know, if a different person acquires a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10409)|
| 2:53:35| I think that's a slippery slope to go down to start saying that we can come in and add restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10415)|
| 2:53:43| We've heard a lot of things from those tonight in terms of some of the specifics, which I won't go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10423)|
| 2:53:53| But, you know, I don't know if this is legal or illegal, but I just don't think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10433)|
| 2:53:59| And I just don't even think it's moral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10439)|
| 2:54:02| So, as I said, I just don't think I can support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10442)|
| 2:54:07| We'll go to Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| I would agree with Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| I'm very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10450)|
| 2:54:11| I was not on council when this new path was taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10451)|
| 2:54:15| I'm very concerned about changing the rules of the game once people have invested money or time or interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10455)|
| 2:54:23| I think the neighborhood has great concerns, and I went out to look at this property, and I can appreciate those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10463)|
| 2:54:31| At the same time, I'm concerned that we do need small businesses to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10471)|
| 2:54:36| That is an area that does have great growth potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| And like Mr. Bailey, I have a real issue with changing the rules once the game plan has been initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10479)|
| 2:54:48| I support use on review in certain circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10488)|
| 2:54:52| but I don't think it's a good idea to impose that on properties that have gone forward under one set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10492)|
| 2:54:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10499)|
| 2:55:00| And we'll go to Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10502)|
| 2:55:03| You know, there is a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| I mean, Joe, you're absolutely right about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| And I think part of what that says is the importance for us to get it right in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10507)|
| 2:55:13| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| For those of us who were around when Victor Jernigan came in with that plan, I mean, you remember this, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10514)|
| 2:55:18| It was a well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| There were sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10520)|
| 2:55:21| There was, you know, a town center concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| We approved that because I think we all got excited, and I think the neighborhood did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10524)|
| 2:55:29| about a vision of doing the development right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| But we didn't get the zoning right, and that's a mistake we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10533)|
| 2:55:36| And I think it's a serious mistake because while this area is prone for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10536)|
| 2:55:42| I think it would be real easy to say this area is also prone for sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| that it's real easy to say that what could happen here is we could just start working out Washington Pike here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10546)|
| 2:55:53| and build all kinds of stuff and make it look like the worst part of Clinton Highway or Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10553)|
| 2:55:58| and we'd have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10558)|
| 2:55:59| We wouldn't have the kind of city we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| While we do need the jobs, we need this commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10562)|
| 2:56:06| I think having that commercial development further in to the city makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10566)|
| 2:56:11| And I don't know if somebody had come along and said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10571)|
| 2:56:15| we want to build the kind of development that's being talked about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| I don't think I would have ever voted to move this out of a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10579)|
| 2:56:24| You know, the need to do development doesn't mean we've got to do whatever development comes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10584)|
| 2:56:32| I wish we had gotten this right in the first place, but we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10592)|
| 2:56:38| And I hear the concerns about changing the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10598)|
| 2:56:43| but frankly the rules that have been changed there is just saying that plan on how you're going to build the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10603)|
| 2:56:51| has to be approved before you get your building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10611)|
| 2:56:57| Mr. King and Mr. Klein talk about some huge onerous, it's a building plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10617)|
| 2:57:03| It is, well, it's a little more than what you need for your building permit, but it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| Where are the streetlights going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10627)|
| 2:57:08| Where are the buildings going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10628)|
| 2:57:09| Where are the parking places going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| And what we're doing is we're putting that on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| and that gives us a little more ability to say you've got to do a better development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10634)|
| 2:57:20| that you can't put up whatever you want, irregardless of what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10640)|
| 2:57:25| Things like the lighting plan, I mean, you've got to plan your lights in the right way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10645)|
| 2:57:33| and I think that's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| I'm inclined to say I would love to see this be an SC zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10655)|
| 2:57:40| but I don't know if the planning commission didn't make the right call on the C3, C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10660)|
| 2:57:46| which leaves the uses that were there, and it just says you've got to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10666)|
| 2:57:53| what it's going to look like early in the process, and you've got to make it look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10673)|
| 2:57:57| And I think that could be the right call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| Yes, I just wanted to add to something Mr. Becker said and the speakers were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10681)|
| 2:58:07| this came about, and I wasn't in this council at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10687)|
| 2:58:10| but this came about with an understanding reached by the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| and Mr. Jernigan and development plans that were going to be compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| with the neighborhood and the residential areas that are around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10698)|
| 2:58:22| and the agricultural areas that were around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10702)|
| 2:58:25| And it's not appropriate for the banks to say they're not bound by some of the representations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10705)|
| 2:58:31| that were made in order to get those approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| This predecessor of theirs came and made the promises to the community, to the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10713)|
| 2:58:38| to whoever, the NPC, and he went bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| He went belly up, but that was a risk these banks took when they made the loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10721)|
| 2:58:46| and this man is the equivalent of their agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10726)|
| 2:58:49| He's made these promises, and now they're stuck with the unfortunate situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10729)|
| 2:58:54| of having to liquidate and get whatever money they can out of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| but it shouldn't change the rules of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| It's not unfair to them to be bound to these promises of working with the community for a fair result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10740)|
| 2:59:06| and I think that since the uses they're talking about are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10746)|
| 2:59:10| I think it's incumbent upon them to accept goodwill on the part of NPC that they will work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10750)|
| 2:59:16| and we would expect the neighborhoods to work with them to just have acceptable and reasonable conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10756)|
| 2:59:22| That may cost a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| That may be unfortunate in the scheme of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| and I know Mr. King talked a whole lot about the size of the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10766)|
| 2:59:30| but the reality is that the development out there is in the midst of both residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10770)|
| 2:59:36| and commercial, excuse me, agricultural uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10776)|
| 2:59:39| and there has to be some check to make sure that we do this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| and I think that's all the planning commission was recommending to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10783)|
| 2:59:47| and I think we should adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| Okay, right now there's no motion on the floor at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10795)|
| 2:59:56| I have a question for Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| You talked about the importance of this council getting it right the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| and you said that unfortunately we didn't in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10802)|
| 3:00:05| and I just would like to clarify what you meant by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| You support the C-3 on the northern parcels and the C-4 on the eastern or southern parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| but you think that the restrictions should have been added when we first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10815)|
| 3:00:19| because, you know, we do that all the time when we annex a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10819)|
| 3:00:22| and then we try to put a zone, a city zone on it that's commensurate with what that's been before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10822)|
| 3:00:29| so that we offer that fairness to a property owner who's invested in a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| and we're not changing the rules of the game just because they've been annexed into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| and it seems like the C-3 and the C-4 were commensurate with what was going on in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| before we took this on, so where do you see that we messed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| I mean, honestly, I would need clarification that these were commercial zones when we annexed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10847)|
| 3:00:53| and that's not something that I'm clear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10853)|
| 3:00:56| I mean, my recollection of this, and Mr. Donaldson can probably look this up a lot faster than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| is that this was all residential or agricultural when it was annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| and it was annexed as part of an agreement that Victor Jernigan had to develop the large area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10865)|
| 3:01:10| That included a lot of residential as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10870)|
| 3:01:14| So, I mean, this is not one where it felt my recollection, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10874)|
| 3:01:18| this wasn't commercial necessarily in the county when it came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10878)|
| 3:01:23| I could be wrong about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| My recollection is that this was an annexation of residential and agricultural property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10887)|
| 3:01:36| and I'm not sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| You definitely have a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10898)|
| 3:01:39| I mean, at some level if the county has done stuff, that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10899)|
| 3:01:43| But I also think when we made the large agreement with Mr. Jernigan, it was for the right kind of project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10903)|
| 3:01:53| and the mistake we made is we didn't put Mr. Donaldson, we didn't memorialize the development plan he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10913)|
| 3:02:00| We didn't take some step in there that said this is what we're doing, this is what you have permission to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10920)|
| 3:02:06| But that was what we were all expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10926)|
| 3:02:08| The neighborhood, Mr. Jernigan, and I think this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| Mr. Donaldson, what was this county zone on these properties before they came into the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10931)|
| 3:02:17| I don't recall, but if they had been ag, they would have come into the city as ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10937)|
| 3:02:22| and then it would have been rezoned after that, and I don't recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10942)|
| 3:02:29| and I don't have the history of each parcel in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| Ms. Starbuck, do you have a recollection of that place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| I do believe it was neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| It was neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10957)|
| 3:02:38| I think that what the original idea was, the property was originally a mixture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10958)|
| 3:02:45| and I don't know which specific properties were what, but we had agricultural and industrial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10965)|
| 3:02:55| that was originally rezoned in the county to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10975)|
| 3:03:03| And we cooperated with Mr. Jernigan to get mostly agricultural property rezoned to neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10983)|
| 3:03:10| because it had very limited uses and it was appropriate because it was at the crossroads of an important intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=10990)|
| 3:03:20| And one of our biggest concerns about all of this was the traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11000)|
| 3:03:25| And, you know, we were assured not only of the nature of the kind of development that was going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11005)|
| 3:03:32| but also that before any commercial development took place there, there would be road improvements made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11012)|
| 3:03:39| because it's a big problem with the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11019)|
| 3:03:42| So basically our problem was that we allowed the neighborhood commercial to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11022)|
| 3:03:50| and then Mr. Jernigan made a deal with you guys to get annexed into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11030)|
| 3:03:57| He did a voluntary annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11037)|
| 3:04:02| He had applied for a TIF and, you know, he was a wheeling and dealing about trying to get, you know, money for the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11042)|
| 3:04:10| in return for the annexation, and that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11050)|
| 3:04:15| And so the property got annexed, and I guess, frankly, probably we took our eye off the ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11055)|
| 3:04:24| and relying on Mr. Jernigan's plans, concept that he already had out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11064)|
| 3:04:30| and his assurances to all of us about what he was going to be doing with these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11070)|
| 3:04:35| that it came in at C3, which we vehemently, without any restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11075)|
| 3:04:40| which we vehemently should have opposed because it wasn't in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11080)|
| 3:04:46| it wasn't part of the concept that we were originally sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11086)|
| 3:04:51| So that's kind of the history of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11091)|
| 3:04:55| So technically, yes, it did come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| It was neighborhood commercial before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| I have a question for Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| Where in this, and forgive me if you've answered this already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11103)|
| 3:05:06| but where in this timeline did your client purchase this piece of property that's to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11106)|
| 3:05:13| Oh, no, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11113)|
| 3:05:16| I was talking to John King, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| When did your client...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11120)|
| 3:05:22| It was bought...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11122)|
| 3:05:30| This piece that he owns...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11130)|
| 3:05:32| The blue piece over there, uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| The part next to Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11134)|
| 3:05:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11135)|
| 3:05:36| Early 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| Early 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11138)|
| 3:05:39| So at that point, when your client purchased that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11139)|
| 3:05:42| it was already in the city with the C4 zone, with the C1 uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11142)|
| 3:05:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11147)|
| 3:05:48| Now, keep in mind, you know, we've talked about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11148)|
| 3:05:52| That's the end of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11152)|
| 3:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| I'd like to respond to some of the comments made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| We'll give you a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11158)|
| 3:05:59| Let's get through some questions now, and then we'll give you a chance to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11162)|
| 3:06:03| I just want to be sure, and, Mark, when the property came into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11163)|
| 3:06:08| or when it was annexed, the piece to the west was zone C4 without any restrictions, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11168)|
| 3:06:17| There were conditions applied to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11177)|
| 3:06:22| Kevin has provided me the staff report from when this was brought into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11182)|
| 3:06:27| and it was a variety of existing zones in the county of shopping center, office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11187)|
| 3:06:33| planned residential, and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| On the eastern properties, that had been zone CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| which is the neighborhood commercial in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11200)|
| 3:06:43| It was brought in as C4 with conditions that the uses be limited to those that are available in C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11203)|
| 3:06:51| which is the city's neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| plus three additional uses of self-storage, warehouse, restaurant, and liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11213)|
| 3:07:04| And then the piece to the north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| North piece, the 9201 was zoned CA in the county, which is their general commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11226)|
| 3:07:14| and the other properties were, well, two of the three other properties were brought in at that time as AG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11234)|
| 3:07:23| because they had been AG in the county, and they were subsequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11243)|
| 3:07:29| the corner property, 9201, was converted to C3 to correspond with the CA in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11249)|
| 3:07:37| and then the three properties were zoned C3 to correspond to that first toehold of C3 on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11257)|
| 3:07:47| Have we had a situation where we've gone back and added two requirements to particular zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11267)|
| 3:07:55| Have we done that in the city before, where you have a C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11275)|
| 3:07:59| and then you add additional conditions to it after the fact, or in any zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11279)|
| 3:08:08| We do general rezonings periodically and fairly regularly, where we change the zoning on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11288)|
| 3:08:18| But if you have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11298)|
| 3:08:19| Some of those involve conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11299)|
| 3:08:22| I don't recall a case where we ultimately simply kept the zone, the base zone the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11302)|
| 3:08:28| and added conditions before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11308)|
| 3:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11311)|
| 3:08:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11312)|
| 3:08:33| Mr. King, if you want to respond real quickly, we'll give you a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11313)|
| 3:08:37| You said you had some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11317)|
| 3:08:40| Well, in view of one of the comments, one of the council members, I don't represent him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11320)|
| 3:08:48| I would like to say the reference to Mr. Jarnagan being bankrupt is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11328)|
| 3:08:56| And on the subject of being bound by representations of predecessor, I haven't said that we weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11336)|
| 3:09:12| Mr. Jarnagan's proposal was this development for shop and center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11352)|
| 3:09:16| There was a residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| There were proposed road changes and road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| all of which were separate from the rezoning of these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11361)|
| 3:09:26| the two, if you will, sections of property in which my client is interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11366)|
| 3:09:32| And at the time it came into the city, this piece, the piece next to Weigel's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11372)|
| 3:09:40| there was a negotiation, extended negotiation, about the rezoning of that property in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11380)|
| 3:09:47| And it included neighborhood representatives, MPC, Mr. Jarnagan, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11387)|
| 3:09:54| And the agreement at that time was you get C-4 subject to C-1 uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11394)|
| 3:10:01| which are substantially more restrictive than the C-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11401)|
| 3:10:05| plus we're going to give you these three additional permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11405)|
| 3:10:09| That was negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| If, indeed, we want to talk about how we stand, I stand here today saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11411)|
| 3:10:17| let's do what everybody agreed to about two years ago as far as the use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11417)|
| 3:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11425)|
| 3:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11426)|
| 3:10:27| Mr. Wolf-Barger, if you'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11429)|
| 3:10:30| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11430)|
| 3:10:32| This property, this concept that Mr. Jarnagan brought to us, never included a car wash anywhere, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11432)|
| 3:10:42| And for them to allude to the fact that it may have or could have or might have or should have is ludicrous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11442)|
| 3:10:48| Secondly, you guys are struggling with exactly the same thing that the Metropolitan Planning Commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11448)|
| 3:10:56| And that's how it got convoluted to this point, and now you're dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11456)|
| 3:11:00| The staff made a very good recommendation based on SC-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11460)|
| 3:11:04| because they understood all the complexities of this thing and all these other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| And SC-1 had the conditions that exist in SC-1 match the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11469)|
| 3:11:17| This other proposal from the MPC Commission, now that you're struggling with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11477)|
| 3:11:22| the conditions don't match the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| which is going to create another whole convoluted problem for somebody else down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11485)|
| 3:11:30| I would encourage you to have Mr. Donaldson review with you what SC-1 means and understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11490)|
| 3:11:37| because it's the closest thing to what Mr. Jarnagan promised us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11497)|
| 3:11:42| It's the very closest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11504)|
| 3:11:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11505)|
| 3:11:46| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11506)|
| 3:11:47| Mr. Becker has a question for Mr. Wolf-Barger, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| One of the issues that come up is the idea of those four properties in the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11511)|
| 3:11:56| having only two road accesses to any of three particular roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11516)|
| 3:12:01| Has the neighborhood talked about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| Was that something that was talked in all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11523)|
| 3:12:06| Well, keep in mind, Mr. Jarnagan controlled all the property at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11526)|
| 3:12:08| so this never became a distinct issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11528)|
| 3:12:11| But it is an issue that the staff considered, is it not, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| It was discussed at length at the MPC meeting by the attorneys and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11535)|
| 3:12:20| It does require some cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11540)|
| 3:12:22| But, once again, we have the BZA to eliminate denial of rights to use your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11542)|
| 3:12:29| And, you know, many of these issues are going to wind up at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11549)|
| 3:12:33| I mean, many of these properties will probably wind up at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| But that's what those folks volunteer their time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11555)|
| 3:12:38| and ultimately take the recommendation of the staff and make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| I would defer to Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11562)|
| 3:12:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11564)|
| 3:12:45| Mr. Donaldson, if you want to add anything on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| The concept of access management is almost universally used throughout the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11568)|
| 3:12:54| and the sharing of driveways and the execution of cross-access easements is used a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11574)|
| 3:13:02| The plan that Mr. Jarnagan sold to the community for those northern properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11582)|
| 3:13:09| has one driveway access to McCampbell Road and one driveway access to Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11589)|
| 3:13:18| With four properties, you could very easily put a shared driveway at the property line of two of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11598)|
| 3:13:27| and execute cross-access easements to assure access for all of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11607)|
| 3:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11613)|
| 3:13:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11614)|
| 3:13:35| Mr. Grieve, and then I'll go to Mr. Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11615)|
| 3:13:40| Mr. Wolfenbarger, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11620)|
| 3:13:43| Did you say that as far as what we're referring to as the property to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11623)|
| 3:13:49| that you folks would agree to what they want to do with that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11629)|
| 3:13:54| I'm not sure what it is they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11634)|
| 3:13:56| The neighborhood discussed this recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11636)|
| 3:14:00| and the two neighborhood associations agreed after discussing it with our members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11640)|
| 3:14:06| I mean, we're in agreement with the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11646)|
| 3:14:08| The staff has a grip on how all this stuff comes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11648)|
| 3:14:12| They're the ones that's going to have to deal with it in the review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11652)|
| 3:14:17| and frankly, we defer to them because, I mean, in this particular case, you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11657)|
| 3:14:24| excuse me for saying you guys, the council asked, the previous council, and some of you were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11664)|
| 3:14:29| the previous council, at our request, asked the MPC, technically the staff, to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11669)|
| 3:14:37| and come up with their best recommendation, and in our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11677)|
| 3:14:41| it's the best and closest to what we were promised by Mr. Jernigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11681)|
| 3:14:46| and I regret that these banks have had to take these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11686)|
| 3:14:49| but that was an inherent risk in lending money, and that's not anybody's responsibility in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11689)|
| 3:14:57| When you say the two neighborhood organizations, which two neighborhood organizations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11697)|
| 3:15:02| Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association, which we're in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| and therefore you are the folks we have to come to, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11705)|
| 3:15:11| I guess all three of us asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11711)|
| 3:15:14| Do you represent that immediate neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11716)|
| 3:15:17| And Lisa, I won't speak for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| She's already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11721)|
| 3:15:22| If you'll give her 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11722)|
| 3:15:25| Only if you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11725)|
| 3:15:26| We need to keep this moving, so I'll be very direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| Northeast Knox Preservation Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11729)|
| 3:15:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11731)|
| 3:15:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11732)|
| 3:15:33| Anything else, Mr. Grew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11734)|
| 3:15:35| Mr. DelaBobe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11735)|
| 3:15:36| Point of clarification, and it might be a two-part question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11736)|
| 3:15:39| One is, as a council, can we adopt something other than the MPC full commission recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11739)|
| 3:15:48| since we're hearing this with the benefit of their recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11748)|
| 3:15:51| That's for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11751)|
| 3:15:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11753)|
| 3:15:54| Legally, you can adopt anything that you believe to be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11754)|
| 3:15:58| as long as it was considered by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11758)|
| 3:16:02| So you've got to be able to look at the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| and determine whether or not what it is you propose to approve has been considered by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11764)|
| 3:16:09| If it has, you can adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11771)|
| 3:16:12| Second part of the question is, I heard Mr. Wolfenbarger state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| and I'm going to address this to Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| that the staff's SC1 designation was somehow a more elegant solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11778)|
| 3:16:23| in that it had use on review type criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11783)|
| 3:16:27| but it was more of a planned commercial type activity, if I can use that phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11787)|
| 3:16:32| And I don't mean to use it precisely, because I'm not sure I know the distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11792)|
| 3:16:35| Tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| The SC1 zone district is a planned zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11797)|
| 3:16:41| that has the development plan approval process built into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| So prior to any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11805)|
| 3:16:47| the development plan has to be approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11807)|
| 3:16:50| It is consistent with the sector plan land use designations that are already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11810)|
| 3:16:56| which is the majority of the area is designated neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11816)|
| 3:17:01| and three of the parcels are designated general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11821)|
| 3:17:07| There have been some statements about individual parcels are not able to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11827)|
| 3:17:14| under the SC1 parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11834)|
| 3:17:17| The parameters that are described within the district apply to the district as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11837)|
| 3:17:21| not to individual parcels within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11841)|
| 3:17:25| So any parcel does not have to satisfy all of the requirements of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11845)|
| 3:17:31| So if they were smaller units, they could still fit within a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11851)|
| 3:17:34| as long as they were in keeping with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11854)|
| 3:17:36| As long as the district as a whole is meeting those parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11856)|
| 3:17:41| At a minimum, we're dealing with three different districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| one a nine-acre, one a six-acre, and one a 17-acre district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11864)|
| 3:17:49| all of which have enough land to develop all of the parameters that are required within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11869)|
| 3:17:55| The westernmost track is SC1, and it's not at issue, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11875)|
| 3:17:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11878)|
| 3:17:59| So we're talking about the other two, the northern and the eastern piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11879)|
| 3:18:02| General rule of thumb on commercial development in a suburban-style setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11882)|
| 3:18:07| one-story retail and office boxes, is that you can get 10,000 square feet of developed space per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11887)|
| 3:18:15| All of these parcels on the northern side are at least an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11895)|
| 3:18:21| Now, there is some floodplain on the back, which would eliminate some of the developable land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11901)|
| 3:18:26| but that's required for setbacks and that sort of thing anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11906)|
| 3:18:31| So you can use that as buffer or some other approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11911)|
| 3:18:37| Is there any one of these tracks that becomes unbuildable because of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11917)|
| 3:18:40| No, and if that were the case, there is an avenue through the BZA to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11920)|
| 3:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11927)|
| 3:18:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11928)|
| 3:18:49| Can I be heard on that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| Let me ask some questions here, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| We will give you a chance to come back at the end, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11933)|
| 3:18:55| So just kind of hold all your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11935)|
| 3:18:59| Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11939)|
| 3:19:00| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11940)|
| 3:19:01| How many lots are in the eastern track, the one where your client has possible plans to do a liquor store or a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11941)|
| 3:19:14| Where I see the blue and the green and back, are there a number of different tracks in that, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11954)|
| 3:19:20| There are four parcels in the city in that easternmost track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11960)|
| 3:19:27| and then the existing Weigels is another parcel, but that's not in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11967)|
| 3:19:33| There's 9203, 9207, 9206, and 9205.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11973)|
| 3:19:38| So Weigels is not in the city, but the rest of it makes up four different tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11978)|
| 3:19:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11982)|
| 3:19:43| Which would fall under the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11985)|
| 3:19:46| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11986)|
| 3:19:49| Mr. Swanson, I'd like to make a motion to put something on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11989)|
| 3:19:53| because I don't think we have anything on yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11993)|
| 3:19:54| And what's in front of us is 12N, which is the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11994)|
| 3:19:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=11999)|
| 3:20:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12000)|
| 3:20:01| And if I understand under the action portion of this agenda information sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12001)|
| 3:20:07| what the Metropolitan Planning Commission passed and sent on to us for confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12007)|
| 3:20:12| was no sector plan action on the gray part, right, which is they're calling the western part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12012)|
| 3:20:19| And an amendment of this county sector plan to general commercial for the eastern part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12019)|
| 3:20:27| and also general commercial for the northern part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12027)|
| 3:20:33| I think that's right, but I want to look to Mr. Donaldson to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12033)|
| 3:20:36| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| Yes, and I would refer back to the process that the Planning Commission ended up taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12038)|
| 3:20:46| to settle on the zoning first and then craft the plan amendment to fit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12046)|
| 3:20:50| because there are options on zoning that, for example, the SC1 doesn't require a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12050)|
| 3:20:58| And remind me again why we are considering an item that amends the county sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12058)|
| 3:21:06| because these small city parcels actually fall within a sector plan that's a county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12066)|
| 3:21:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12072)|
| 3:21:13| And we have jurisdiction to amend a county sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12073)|
| 3:21:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12076)|
| 3:21:17| This property is within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| We divide the county into 12 sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12079)|
| 3:21:24| There is only one sector in one jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12084)|
| 3:21:28| That's the central city sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| And everything else has this square area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12092)|
| 3:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12095)|
| 3:21:36| I would like to move approval of 12N as it is stated in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12096)|
| 3:21:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12100)|
| 3:21:42| We'll have a motion and a second on 12N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| Mr. Becker, Mr. King, I did promise you a chance to respond to some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12105)|
| 3:21:49| This would be a good time if you'll keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12109)|
| 3:21:52| Well, it's not directly related to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12112)|
| 3:21:56| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12116)|
| 3:21:57| I know it's not directly related to the motion, but you had asked before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12117)|
| 3:21:59| I don't want to interrupt the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12119)|
| 3:22:01| I was going to go away from the podium and the motion was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12121)|
| 3:22:04| Was there a second to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12124)|
| 3:22:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| I don't often differ strenuously with MPC staff, but I do on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12129)|
| 3:22:18| I think, Mr. Donaldson, while I may be technically correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12138)|
| 3:22:24| is grossly oversimplified the issue with respect to the suggestion being made by the opposition about an SC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12144)|
| 3:22:35| If you look at your zoning ordinance and look at the zoning classification for SC zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12155)|
| 3:22:41| you will find that permitted uses in the SC zone shall be located in a unified shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12161)|
| 3:22:53| which shall have not less than five nor more than 20 shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12173)|
| 3:22:57| one of which shall be an anchor tenant of not less than 10,000 square feet gross floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12177)|
| 3:23:04| The shops and stores shall have a combined total gross floor area of not less than 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12184)|
| 3:23:12| nor more than 100,000 square feet, and the anchor tenant shall comprise no greater than 50% of the total area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12192)|
| 3:23:19| Buildings shall not cover more than 20% of the site on which the center is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12199)|
| 3:23:24| You have a letter from Mr. Harbin basically that says in order to develop any site within this zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12204)|
| 3:23:30| the minimum lot size must be 100,000 square feet or 2.3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12210)|
| 3:23:35| None of the parcels that my client had an interest in meet that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| And to suggest that, well, you can just group it and do it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12219)|
| 3:23:45| Let's group those four lots over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12225)|
| 3:23:48| Let me go build one building on the corner and I've now stopped them from building anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12228)|
| 3:23:54| It doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| That's the reason MPC decided very quickly we're not going to be talking about an SC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12236)|
| 3:24:02| And I've just talked to you about some of the issues in an SC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12242)|
| 3:24:07| I respectfully suggest to you that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12247)|
| 3:24:11| whatever consideration you make is that you don't put that back in the mix of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12251)|
| 3:24:17| without a lot more discussion and explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12257)|
| 3:24:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12261)|
| 3:24:22| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12262)|
| 3:24:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12263)|
| 3:24:24| I just want to point out that over the course of the time I've been on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12264)|
| 3:24:29| we've asked the MPC to do a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| And at times we've even questioned ourselves, you know, can MPC afford to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12271)|
| 3:24:37| But none of us ever balk when we ask, when a member or group of members ask the MPC to look into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12277)|
| 3:24:44| Well, they did and they came back with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12284)|
| 3:24:47| And I always, 99% of the time I look at the MPC staff recommendations and I try to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12287)|
| 3:24:55| But in this case, we've asked them to do something after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12295)|
| 3:25:02| And we're talking about adding restrictions to something we don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12302)|
| 3:25:07| A bank owns it, somebody else owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| And I don't know how we can begin to do these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12309)|
| 3:25:14| I just don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| I think it's a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12316)|
| 3:25:19| Mr. Klein said earlier something to the effect about business in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12319)|
| 3:25:25| When we all ran for office, we hear about how difficult it is to do work in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12325)|
| 3:25:30| And we work in the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12330)|
| 3:25:32| and we've tried to clear the path to do more business in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12332)|
| 3:25:36| And I think this sends a clear signal that it's virtually impossible if we do these kinds of things for any developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12336)|
| 3:25:42| with a small piece of property to try to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12342)|
| 3:25:48| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12348)|
| 3:25:49| We had a couple of other people who stood up and wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| And I know that, is it Mr. Shanks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| Shanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12353)|
| 3:25:54| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12354)|
| 3:25:55| I knew he was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12355)|
| 3:25:56| You've been standing up for a very long time and you didn't even talk long the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12356)|
| 3:25:59| Greg, do you have something you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12359)|
| 3:26:02| My response is that Victor Jernigan never was an agent for Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12362)|
| 3:26:07| We made our loan in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12367)|
| 3:26:10| We made a loan on one piece of property, a $400,000 piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12370)|
| 3:26:16| My client didn't make a loan on a shopping center, on a strip center, or on anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12376)|
| 3:26:20| We made a loan on a vacant piece of property that was worth $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12380)|
| 3:26:24| And that's what we loaned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12384)|
| 3:26:25| As you probably all know, you cannot find a more conservative bank than Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12385)|
| 3:26:29| And so, you know, that's what we loaned money on in good faith, and that's what we took back as our collateral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12389)|
| 3:26:35| And to potentially take away our driveway and make our property absolutely worthless is just not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12395)|
| 3:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12403)|
| 3:26:44| Okay, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12404)|
| 3:26:45| I want to clarify, either with Mr. Donaldson or Mr. Swanson, that I understand fully where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12405)|
| 3:26:51| The motion that I put on the floor for the amendment of the sector plan does not speak to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12411)|
| 3:26:58| I agree with Mr. Bailey that I think some of these restrictions that are added after the fact are unfair to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12418)|
| 3:27:07| But I think that I can support the sector plan amendment and not support the rezoning changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12427)|
| 3:27:13| And I know, Mr. Donaldson, you said that MPC addressed these in the opposite order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12433)|
| 3:27:17| But on our agenda, they're in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| And so I want to make sure that I'm clear on what I'm voting for and where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12439)|
| 3:27:25| Does that question make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| Item 9 is the plan amendment to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12447)|
| 3:27:32| And the effect of the motion would be to remove the neighborhood commercial designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12452)|
| 3:27:37| for the easternmost property of the northern group and all of the eastern properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12457)|
| 3:27:45| and convert that to general commercial with the exception of the one that we forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12465)|
| 3:27:51| And did they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| They didn't have to be general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| It's very confusing between the sector plan designations and the zoning designations sometimes when you don't deal with this day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12475)|
| 3:28:01| The general commercial designation was not required to have the C3 and the C4 that's already existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12481)|
| 3:28:12| Why do we have to change the sector plan designation when these are already C3 and C4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12492)|
| 3:28:21| Because the CN zoning that was in place on the easternmost properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12501)|
| 3:28:29| was consistent with the neighborhood commercial land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12509)|
| 3:28:34| In the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12514)|
| 3:28:35| In the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12515)|
| 3:28:36| But when it came into the city, it was converted to C4 with C1 uses plus 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12516)|
| 3:28:45| So when it came into the city and we gave it a city zoning of C4 with C1 uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12525)|
| 3:28:51| we should have changed the sector plan then because that was inconsistent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12531)|
| 3:28:55| Well, the C1 uses are the predominant use of the land and you could argue that that would be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12535)|
| 3:29:03| But technically it's C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12543)|
| 3:29:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12545)|
| 3:29:06| In order to get those additional three uses, we had to go to the C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12546)|
| 3:29:11| So when we gave it that zone in the city, we should have done the sector plan amendment then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12551)|
| 3:29:16| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12556)|
| 3:29:17| Okay, then I stand by my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12557)|
| 3:29:21| Okay, there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12561)|
| 3:29:22| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12562)|
| 3:29:23| I'm just going to ask Mr. King, do you interpret Councilman Roddy's, what she's just stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12563)|
| 3:29:31| I'll make it easier than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| Is there any harm in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12573)|
| 3:29:35| We don't have an opposition to the motion because these plan amendments don't create, if you will, a problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12575)|
| 3:29:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12588)|
| 3:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12591)|
| 3:29:52| Everybody understand the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12592)|
| 3:29:54| Okay, ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12594)|
| 3:29:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12596)|
| 3:29:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12597)|
| 3:29:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12598)|
| 3:29:59| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12599)|
| 3:30:02| That was simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12602)|
| 3:30:06| Bill, though, is an ordinance to rezone property located on the north, south, and west sides of Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12606)|
| 3:30:11| north side of McCampbell Drive, southwest and southeast of Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12611)|
| 3:30:15| by retaining SC1, Neighborhood Shopping Center District, for the western property subject to conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12615)|
| 3:30:21| retaining C3, General Commercial District, for the northern property subject to conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12621)|
| 3:30:25| and retaining C4, Highway and Arterial Commercial District, for the eastern property subject to conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12625)|
| 3:30:31| City of Knoxville applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12631)|
| 3:30:34| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12634)|
| 3:30:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12636)|
| 3:30:37| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12637)|
| 3:30:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12638)|
| 3:30:39| I'm going to restate that motion so that I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| And the key words that I heard there were retain and subject to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12642)|
| 3:30:47| So, Mr. Donaldson, what I heard was each of the zoning designations that were already on these three groupings of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12647)|
| 3:30:56| are being retained under this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12656)|
| 3:30:59| However, they are subject to the additional restrictions that you stated at the beginning of our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12659)|
| 3:31:06| And those vary a little bit from grouping to grouping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12666)|
| 3:31:09| Some involve lighting plans and some involve driveways and various other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12669)|
| 3:31:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12676)|
| 3:31:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12677)|
| 3:31:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12678)|
| 3:31:19| And if I would vote against this motion, then because the motion says retain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12679)|
| 3:31:25| each of these three groupings of properties would retain the SC1, the C3, and the C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12685)|
| 3:31:32| They just wouldn't have the added layer of subject to put on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12692)|
| 3:31:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12696)|
| 3:31:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12697)|
| 3:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12698)|
| 3:31:39| And we have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12701)|
| 3:31:42| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12702)|
| 3:31:45| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12705)|
| 3:31:46| There was a second, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| This is what we've really been talking about all night up to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| So that it is clear if it wasn't already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12712)|
| 3:31:56| On behalf of my client, I'm opposed to the imposition of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12716)|
| 3:32:02| So I would be opposed to the motion as to those two parcels of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12722)|
| 3:32:09| One, the part freeze, all of those parcels on the north side of Washington Pike west of Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12729)|
| 3:32:22| and the same as to those parcels of property on the south side of Washington Pike east of Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12742)|
| 3:32:30| We would be opposed to and we would urge you to vote in opposition to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12750)|
| 3:32:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12756)|
| 3:32:37| Mr. Kahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12757)|
| 3:32:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12758)|
| 3:32:39| Very briefly, I support what Mr. King just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12759)|
| 3:32:42| but for purposes of the three parcels of land that I represent that is owned by National Bank of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12762)|
| 3:32:50| it potentially deprives National Bank of Tennessee of a beneficial use of those three parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12770)|
| 3:32:57| Number one, speaking to Councilman Bailey's earlier comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12777)|
| 3:33:03| it would be an arbitrary and capricious condition attached to the C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12783)|
| 3:33:08| Those all four conditions would be arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12788)|
| 3:33:12| So I'd ask you to vote against this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12792)|
| 3:33:16| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12796)|
| 3:33:18| Mr. Wolfenbarger, Mr. Murphy, do you have anything you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12798)|
| 3:33:22| First, just allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12802)|
| 3:33:24| It looks like we're on a path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12804)|
| 3:33:27| But, you know, first of all, we want to thank Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12807)|
| 3:33:31| As a community, we want to thank you for approaching this thing from the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12811)|
| 3:33:36| This is not the way we would have liked it to have gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12816)|
| 3:33:38| And just for the record, I want everyone to know, and I want Mr. Donaldson to verify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| our neighborhood associations had no contact with MPC staff regarding this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12822)|
| 3:33:49| after the neighborhood associations had no contact with MPC staff regarding this SC-1 recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12829)|
| 3:33:56| So it wasn't something that we sought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| It was purely something that staff thought was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12838)|
| 3:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12844)|
| 3:34:05| Rick, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12845)|
| 3:34:06| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12846)|
| 3:34:07| I think that the motion that's on the table is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12847)|
| 3:34:13| When Mr. Jernigan was coming in this, I think there was no point of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12853)|
| 3:34:17| let's have a concept plan, let's have all this, because we had all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12857)|
| 3:34:20| We had the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12860)|
| 3:34:21| It's in our packet from years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12861)|
| 3:34:25| Because there was an expectation of the right kind of thing being built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12865)|
| 3:34:29| And I don't think it is in our bid for incapricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12869)|
| 3:34:32| I think that there was a design plan on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| And I think especially it's not an onerous thing to say that you've got to decide where your lights go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12874)|
| 3:34:42| before you get your building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12882)|
| 3:34:44| I don't think this is onerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12884)|
| 3:34:46| I honestly don't think it's going to limit the development that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12886)|
| 3:34:48| This is stuff you have to do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12888)|
| 3:34:50| But it gives us the right kind of development to put these conditions on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12890)|
| 3:34:54| So I think this is the right motion to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12894)|
| 3:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12899)|
| 3:35:00| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12900)|
| 3:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12902)|
| 3:35:03| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12903)|
| 3:35:04| Everybody understand the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12904)|
| 3:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12905)|
| 3:35:06| We'll just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12906)|
| 3:35:08| The motion is to approve as written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12910)|
| 3:35:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12911)|
| 3:35:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12913)|
| 3:35:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12914)|

| 3:35:40| The motion fails four to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12940)|
| 3:35:42| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12942)|

| 3:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12944)|
| 3:35:45| So just so I'm clear, Mr. Swanson, where does that leave us right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12945)|
| 3:35:50| Which swamp are we in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12950)|
| 3:35:52| Right now we have changed the sector plan and we have denied a motion to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12952)|
| 3:36:03| So if I'm interpreting what's happening correctly, what you want to have happen is to retain the zoning with no conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12963)|
| 3:36:15| without the conditions that were attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12975)|
| 3:36:18| Mr. Donaldson, do they need to do anything else to cause that to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12978)|
| 3:36:22| I think by taking no action on this agenda item, the zoning stays the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12982)|
| 3:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12988)|
| 3:36:29| That's what I thought, but I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=12989)|
