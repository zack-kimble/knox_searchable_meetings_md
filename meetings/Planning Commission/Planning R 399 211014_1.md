| 2:37:23| He owns this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| And so, it kind of doesn't add up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9445)|
| 2:37:33| He's trying to rezone his own property, not go out and buy a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9453)|
| 2:37:41| Chair recognizes Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| I think Mr. Graham makes a lot of really good points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| This map is really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9471)|
| 2:37:54| It seems like there's CA all up and down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9474)|
| 2:38:00| And, you know, I don't see any problem at all with it being rezoned to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9480)|
| 2:38:07| And, frankly, it also makes me feel really comfortable that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| he's lived there for 30, 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| I don't think he's going to do something that's going to hurt his own interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| And he's a respected developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| and I would think he'd do something pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| I could support the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9504)|
| 2:38:29| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| I'd like to make a motion to approve the Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| and UCC per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9515)|
| 2:38:40| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth, second by Commissioner Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| to approve the Southwest County Sector Plan Amendment per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9524)|
| 2:38:49| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9531)|
| 2:38:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9532)|
| 2:38:53| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| Chair, we'll entertain a motion on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9535)|
| 2:38:58| I'd like to make a motion we approve the rezoning to GC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9538)|
| 2:39:03| General Commercial and Stream Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9547)|
| 2:39:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9548)|
| 2:39:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9549)|
| 2:39:10| Is it state of rationale for the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9552)|
| 2:39:13| The rationale for the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| You said the GC rationale for the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9555)|
| 2:39:18| Well, because it's a continuation, I think, of what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| And I think it makes sense to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| Sorry, I need a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| I'm assuming I can just say because I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| Liz, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9572)|
| 2:39:33| A point of information related to the staff recommendation for mixed-use community commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9573)|
| 2:39:41| In the land use classification table for the Northwest County Sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| it does not allow consideration of the CA general business zone district at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9585)|
| 2:39:52| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| Let me say, I think based on the size of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| I have a problem that it not be approved for planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| I think it's necessary to come back before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9602)|
| 2:40:05| It's an extremely large piece of commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9605)|
| 2:40:08| and to rezone it to general commercial is probably not in the community's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9608)|
| 2:40:15| I would support staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| I think they had it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| You heard the comment from Liz on the plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9621)|
| 2:40:29| I did not understand what she was saying, so can you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| Well, if I'm correct, Liz or Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9633)|
| 2:40:38| the change to mixed-use community commercial would not allow a DC general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9638)|
| 2:40:44| General commercial is not one of the listed zones for that mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| So what's the answer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| Approve it to planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9652)|
| 2:40:54| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| Or approve as requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9656)|
| 2:41:03| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9663)|
| 2:41:09| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| We've got several lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| It seems like the spirit of his motion was to get to the zoning desired by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9675)|
| 2:41:22| so it seems like we need to potentially go back and fix the previous motion that was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9682)|
| 2:41:28| and do we have the authority to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| That's what I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| We need to determine whether or not we can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| We can vote on it and deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9699)|
| 2:41:44| That will open it back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9704)|
| 2:41:50| It's already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| Well, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9714)|
| 2:41:55| Well, but we can go back and change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9715)|
| 2:42:02| If you voted for it, you can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| You can go back and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| You can make the motion to redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9727)|
| 2:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| We really should have been informed of that before we made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| Yes, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| So you all can go back to the sector plan amendment and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9737)|
| 2:42:24| So, Amy, what would the sector plan amendment need to be in order to accommodate G.C. General Commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9744)|
| 2:42:33| G.C. General Commercial and S.P. Stream Production and then C.A. General Business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| I think procedurally we need to make a motion to rehear the plan amendment or sector plan amendment and vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9763)|
| 2:42:59| and then we can come back and make a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9779)|
| 2:43:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9784)|
| 2:43:05| I entertain a motion to reconsider the plan amendment and to modify it to G.C. General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9785)|
| 2:43:15| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9795)|
| 2:43:16| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9796)|
| 2:43:18| Wait, hold on for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9798)|
| 2:43:19| Let's let Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| Did you have something you wanted to weigh in on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9803)|
| 2:43:24| I have actually pulled up the land use classification table here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| and typically when there is a mixed-use special district and it references another mixed-use district type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9808)|
| 2:43:36| so this one is mixed-use community commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| that also allows consideration of the community commercial uses listed within the land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9820)|
| 2:43:48| My apologies for not mentioning that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| And so the thing it points out here is that there is other zoning to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9832)|
| 2:43:57| and it says in the table as infill development within areas already zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| and it specifically says C-A, C-B, and T, which is a transition zone in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9842)|
| 2:44:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9849)|
| 2:44:10| So we do not need to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| Yeah, so we can move forward with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9857)|
| 2:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9858)|
| 2:44:19| There are a lot of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9859)|
| 2:44:24| Commissioner Roth, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| I'd like to make a motion to approve G-C zoning for the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9866)|
| 2:44:35| It's G-A, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| C-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| C-A, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| C-A, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9878)|
| 2:44:39| I'm so confused right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9879)|
| 2:44:40| I'm looking and reading the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| All right, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9882)|
| 2:44:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9883)|
| 2:44:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| Yeah, Commissioner Perez, second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| Motion is second to approve C-A general commercial, general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9899)|
| 2:45:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9900)|
| 2:45:01| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9901)|

| 2:46:19| Would you rather go first or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9979)|
| 2:46:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9982)|
| 2:46:27| Mr. Murphy, give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| I'm here on behalf of the Knox County Planning Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| and we know it's the hard ones that come in front of you for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| and this one's a hard one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| When you look at the map, this proposal for single-family residential is on the border of the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10004)|
| 2:46:50| But if you drive out there, you'll see that, and I hope that most of you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10010)|
| 2:46:55| you'll see that Brackett Road is very agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| There are cedar-lined roads and lanes, open hay and livestock fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10018)|
| 2:47:04| You've got farm equipment and even occasionally a mule-drawn wagon that goes down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10024)|
| 2:47:11| The centerline stripe, it doesn't exactly go down the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| It kind of varies a little from side to side because Brackett Road's a small farm road back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10034)|
| 2:47:20| So this proposal, it lacks design standards to guide a rural and agrarian design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10040)|
| 2:47:26| that would fit into the context of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| Since the proposal doesn't have design standards, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| the way to mitigate that would be a dense perimeter landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| but there's also not landscaping requirements either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| So the design style clashes with the adjacent property and the uses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| So how do you help smooth this out and make this development an asset to the Brackett Road area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10065)|
| 2:47:50| Transportation, specifically roads, is the other big challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10070)|
| 2:47:54| Brackett may be near 18 feet wide, close to Emory Road, but back towards this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10074)|
| 2:47:59| and then if you keep going back towards Beale Road, it's narrower than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10079)|
| 2:48:03| We've taken a tape measure and, you know, between 18, 17 1⁄2, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| some places closer to 17 to 16, so it's, you know, the point is it's not wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10087)|
| 2:48:12| and it needs some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| You've been provided a transportation, a traffic study that's written with its blinders on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10095)|
| 2:48:20| It fulfills the strict letters of the requirements that you have to have for this traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10100)|
| 2:48:26| but it's got blind spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| So the study only examines Brackett Road going to the nearest intersection at Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10108)|
| 2:48:34| where there's a hill that impacts your sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| You know, the study, it identifies that there's not sufficient sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| at the Brackett-Emory Road intersection, but the study doesn't analyze the safety impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| It doesn't identify any required improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| It just states a fact and it fails to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| It's kind of like if you're an engineer, you see a sinkhole on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10133)|
| 2:48:56| You say, yep, there's a sinkhole, and then you go ahead and build on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| The only fix might come if Emory Road is widened, but staff report says they've talked with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| and, you know, that's coming closer to the 2030 timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| So any accidents that, you know, before that widening, you know, property damage, injury or death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10148)|
| 2:49:13| that's the concern we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10153)|
| 2:49:16| So back to that traffic study, the residents that have spoken previously here and at County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10156)|
| 2:49:23| have stated that they usually go the other way, down to Bell Road and then Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| because they feel it's safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| So that's the people that live on this road and drive it and have to deal with the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10169)|
| 2:49:34| The traffic study doesn't analyze any conditions at all along that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| pavement or issues at, you know, Bell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10178)|
| 2:49:42| At last month's agenda review meeting, if you were there, county engineering expressed concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10182)|
| 2:49:47| There's a sharp 90-degree turn on Brackett Road with very limited sight distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10187)|
| 2:49:52| and, you know, there's also, you know, really tight sight distance at the Bell Brackett intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10192)|
| 2:49:58| But the traffic study is silent on those issues, and you'll need to ask some questions about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| because you don't have any information in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| Also pretty unique to this spot, 100% of the soil is prime or locally important farmland soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10206)|
| 2:50:12| and the Northeast Sector Plan clearly calls out a need to preserve prime farmland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10212)|
| 2:50:18| but the proposal is silent on soil conservation and opportunities to preserve some of this farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10218)|
| 2:50:25| So every time planned residential is introduced, the applicant, staff, elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10225)|
| 2:50:30| and planning commission, you know, here at these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| everybody tells the community that issues like traffic, stormwater, character, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| will be addressed at the USUN review hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| Well, we are here at that hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| This is the time you're supposed to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| You have knowledgeable staff and an experienced applicant who can answer your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| and make suggestions for improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| All of you were appointed by elected officials because of respect for your expertise and insight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10251)|
| 2:50:56| and that's why the hard ones come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| It's up to you to ask questions and then figure out some requirements and design changes and conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10258)|
| 2:51:04| I'm sure with a little work, you can turn this proposal into a plan that is an asset for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| the local community, and future residents of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10270)|
| 2:51:13| a plan that makes some needed improvements to roads that have genuine safety concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| and that doesn't detract from the agriculture character of Bracket Road or its current residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10278)|
| 2:51:23| I look forward to hearing your questions for staff and the applicant, a vigorous discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| and hear the ideas you come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| KCPA has a lot of respect for the experience and expertise of all of you on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10290)|
| 2:51:35| and you have it in your power to work and make this something that everybody can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| Mr. Davis, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10303)|
| 2:51:46| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10306)|
| 2:51:52| We're about probably, I don't know, maybe two-tenths of a mile from Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10312)|
| 2:51:57| Bracket's a centerline painted road, which means normally, I think, according to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10317)|
| 2:52:02| I think it has to be at least, what, 18 feet wide to be painted down the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10322)|
| 2:52:06| So the road is more than adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| It's better than a lot of the roads in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| and I would respectfully request you all approve as per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10335)|
| 2:52:16| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10336)|
| 2:52:18| Yeah, I'm listening to Mr. Murphy, and I've been in several meetings with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10338)|
| 2:52:25| and he always brings up good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10345)|
| 2:52:31| And I'm reading the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| As he suggests, we're not talking about a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| We're talking about a concept and development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10356)|
| 2:52:39| And he suggests that we've got really good, competent staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10359)|
| 2:52:45| and I didn't hear you say that the highway department was competent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10365)|
| 2:52:48| but I'm assuming we think that the highway department is competent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10368)|
| 2:52:54| And it looks to me like staff has addressed the road width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10374)|
| 2:53:02| requiring that there's 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10382)|
| 2:53:05| They've addressed at least one of the site issues at Bracket Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| saying that that has to be verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| We did do a traffic impact study, it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10391)|
| 2:53:14| with Knox County Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| and they've determined that there's some road improvements at East Emery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10397)|
| 2:53:20| which is not going to be a day at the beach to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10400)|
| 2:53:24| But it looks like that is a requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| and I didn't hear the applicant say that he was not willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10406)|
| 2:53:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| We're not talking about farmland here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| I guess he's just developing under what got rezoned, which it is rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10417)|
| 2:53:42| so he has the right to submit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| And I'm just making sure that it looks to me like that's fairly covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10425)|
| 2:53:49| and I'm not at all adverse to going down those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10429)|
| 2:53:58| because I think he always brings up good conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| It looks to me like we're covered there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10441)|
| 2:54:07| I'm missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10449)|
| 2:54:13| I was just going to say that, honestly, it's 2,000 feet off Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10453)|
| 2:54:19| and we're talking three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| The subdivision plan is going to be compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| with whatever the highway department requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10464)|
| 2:54:28| I'm prepared to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| Does she have other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10471)|
| 2:54:32| Make a motion at any time, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10474)|
| 2:54:35| She would like to make a comment first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| We can make motions in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| We won't vote until we hear from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| If you want to wait, I'll wait on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10486)|
| 2:54:47| I wanted to pick up on Mr. Murphy's question about the soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10487)|
| 2:54:52| I did see his ‑‑ it was a comment that was posted for all of us to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10492)|
| 2:54:57| and there was a section of the sector plan, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10497)|
| 2:54:59| that talks about soils and the native farm soils and protecting those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10499)|
| 2:55:04| And in your review of the things that were addressed appropriately by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10504)|
| 2:55:11| soils wasn't part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10511)|
| 2:55:14| So can someone educate me on the soils part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10514)|
| 2:55:18| Sure, I'll be happy to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| So the section that Mr. Murphy referenced is in the background report of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10521)|
| 2:55:28| So it's compiling data and providing observations to that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10528)|
| 2:55:33| And then further back in the land use plan section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| the second part of the sector plan is where we're making recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10537)|
| 2:55:40| on how to implement those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10540)|
| 2:55:44| For the conservation of farmland soils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10544)|
| 2:55:48| really it provides options for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10548)|
| 2:55:51| and makes suggestions on creating new zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10551)|
| 2:55:55| One of them was the large lot residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10555)|
| 2:56:00| We kind of addressed it through the rural preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| I think that's what it's called, rural preservation zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10562)|
| 2:56:05| which is not really used very often at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| It's really meant for conserving farms instead of developing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10568)|
| 2:56:13| But it really provides a basket of options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10573)|
| 2:56:17| some that we could implement in some form or fashion through the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10577)|
| 2:56:21| others we have no ability to implement at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| like transfer of development rights is an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| conservation subdivisions is an option in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| But we really don't have anything on the books that would allow you to implement that per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10594)|
| 2:56:40| Through the PR zone, someone could do a conservation subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10600)|
| 2:56:45| but it's not, it's an option on how to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10605)|
| 2:56:50| It's the kind of thing that the developer would have had to come to us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10610)|
| 2:56:53| we would like to do this with a conservation, the language you just used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10613)|
| 2:57:04| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion we approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| for up to 90 detached dwelling units on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10628)|

| 2:57:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10642)|
| 2:57:23| A motion by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| to approve the concept plan subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| All in favor of the motion say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10650)|

| 2:57:35| Chair, I want to entertain a motion to approve the development plan and setback reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10655)|
| 2:57:40| I'll make a motion we approve the development plan for up to 90 detached dwelling lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| and individual lots, reduction of peripheral setback from 35 to 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10664)|
| 2:57:48| along the northwest boundary of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10668)|
| 2:57:50| or adjacent to planned residential zoning only, subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10670)|

| 2:58:00| per staff's recommendation, seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| All in favor of the motion say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10684)|
| 2:58:07| Opposed? Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10687)|

| 2:58:46| Staff recommendation, approve the development plan for a bed and breakfast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| with up to two guest room bedrooms in the historic Boyd Harvey House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10730)|
| 2:58:54| and one guest bedroom in the existing Carriage House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| subject to the following conditions, which are six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10738)|

| 2:59:11| Would you like to go first or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| I'll defer to opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10754)|
| 2:59:20| Please state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10760)|

| 2:59:24| James Hack. I reside at 12605 Sweetgate Lane in Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10764)|
| 2:59:31| My home is located on approximately a half acre parcel that's adjacent to the applicant's parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10771)|
| 2:59:38| We share a 239 foot property line along the southwest corner of that Boyd Harvey House property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10778)|
| 2:59:46| Fundamentally, we have concerns about the establishment of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| or semi-commercial enterprise that would be adjacent to our home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10790)|
| 2:59:55| and actually adjacent to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10795)|
| 2:59:58| Our concerns in this case really come from the fact that the approval is sought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10798)|
| 3:00:03| and recommended by staff with what we feel is an incomplete list of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| with regard to the operation of a bed and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| One of the conditions that you mentioned in the review is that it meets all the applicable requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10815)|
| 3:00:23| in Knox County ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| And yet later in the report it says there are no specific criteria related to the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10825)|
| 3:00:29| or approval of a lodging and boarding house as use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10829)|
| 3:00:35| It sort of sparked some interest to go look in the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| and see if, in fact, I can even find the definition of bed and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| And I couldn't find it in the county ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10844)|
| 3:00:49| Looking at the city ordinances, it has not just a definition for a bed and breakfast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10849)|
| 3:00:56| and, you know, what it's supposed to be about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| but has specific information or guidance on ownership, location, guest rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10859)|
| 3:01:06| operational requirements, parking, appearance, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10866)|
| 3:01:12| I decided, well, maybe there's something going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| You know, we have two, the city and the county, don't seem to complement each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10875)|
| 3:01:21| As a sanity check, I wanted to explore a number of municipal ordinances around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10881)|
| 3:01:27| And it was remarkable how well those lined up with the city ordinances for bed and breakfasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10887)|
| 3:01:38| So there seems to be an absence of real hard guidance for operating this semi-commercial enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10898)|
| 3:01:48| So this is not a matter of objecting in spirit to the idea that this be turned over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10908)|
| 3:02:00| or allowed to operate as a bed and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| The discomfort is really rooted in a concern over the establishment of this commercial enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10922)|
| 3:02:07| And some of the concern for us would be mitigated by having in the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10927)|
| 3:02:15| specific expectations for the operations of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| One of the reasons why we feel this is really important is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10940)|
| 3:02:24| it appears that the approval you would grant is attached to the property, not to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10944)|
| 3:02:30| So when the owner decides to vacate that property and sell it, the new owner comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10950)|
| 3:02:35| and has very little guidance in terms of what the expectations are from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10955)|
| 3:02:40| or from the local area for how to operate this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10960)|
| 3:02:44| But they're given permission, they have permission to basically operate a commercial endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10964)|
| 3:02:49| So this is kind of the first time I've been before a planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10969)|
| 3:02:58| So I've learned a bit here in the last three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| And so I think the ask from our perspective would be that if you grant approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10981)|
| 3:03:08| that you do that with a clear enumeration of requirements, ordinance requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10988)|
| 3:03:14| that provide the kinds of protections I believe those ordinances are providing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=10994)|
| 3:03:22| for example, in the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11002)|
| 3:03:25| And if you feel that an approval must be granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11005)|
| 3:03:32| we would request that that approval is subject to review if that property is sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11012)|
| 3:03:40| for a new owner to make sure that they're complying with reasonable standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11020)|
| 3:03:48| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11028)|

| 3:04:27| It is one of the last remaining homes of this era in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11067)|
| 3:04:33| and it's something that people have an interest in seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11073)|
| 3:04:37| It was originally thought to be a good use for an event center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11077)|
| 3:04:46| and then Ms. White sought to qualify for a rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11086)|
| 3:04:52| In conversations with some of the surrounding neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11092)|
| 3:04:55| including Mr. Hack, who always gives very thoughtful comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11095)|
| 3:04:59| and is good with his time with Ms. White,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| she decided to scale down her aspirations for the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11103)|
| 3:05:08| and to apply for what I think under the local zoning would be a lodging boarding house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11108)|
| 3:05:15| She would want to have people be able to stay overnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11115)|
| 3:05:21| and to share a meal out of a common kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| The way that the house is configured, other than her personal bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11124)|
| 3:05:30| there are two in the main house, and then there's a carriage house with an apartment above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11130)|
| 3:05:36| which under the current agricultural classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11136)|
| 3:05:41| she could allow people to stay in a garage apartment already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11141)|
| 3:05:46| So the change being sought is one of use to allow people to spend the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11146)|
| 3:05:52| and have a meal served out of a common kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11152)|
| 3:05:55| but the footprint of the structure is not being changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| People are already visiting the house to see it and to appreciate the historical nature of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11160)|
| 3:06:08| The fact that it would be used for an overnight facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11168)|
| 3:06:14| probably makes the traffic less than it probably is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11174)|
| 3:06:20| As people are staying there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11180)|
| 3:06:22| then there's going to be less of an incentive to have people visiting the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| but it's a necessary use in our eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11186)|
| 3:06:29| because it's an opportunity for her to earn some income off of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11189)|
| 3:06:35| which frankly she needs in order to keep it restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11195)|
| 3:06:38| and to be able to preserve it and open it up for people to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11198)|
| 3:06:43| in the way that she would like to as a boarding house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11203)|
| 3:06:48| So I'll reserve my time for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| Thank you, Mr. Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11210)|
| 3:06:57| Chair recognizes Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| Yeah, I like the fact that there are no real new improvements to the property footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11220)|
| 3:07:08| and I like that they're not really going into any other parts of the undeveloped property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11228)|
| 3:07:14| That should ease concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11234)|
| 3:07:22| I would like Council to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11242)|
| 3:07:26| I think I know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| I've been around long enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11248)|
| 3:07:29| but I want Council to answer the opposition's question about the future use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11249)|
| 3:07:36| I would assume that what we'd be doing today is approving this specific plan, this specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11256)|
| 3:07:45| Does the county have change of occupancy permits like the city does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11265)|
| 3:07:51| Ownership or occupancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11271)|
| 3:07:54| When you do occupancy, it would be a use permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11274)|
| 3:07:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11278)|
| 3:07:59| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11279)|
| 3:08:00| So the county covers that, I think, to answer his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11280)|
| 3:08:06| So noting that, I'd like to make a recommendation that we approve this for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11286)|
| 3:08:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11294)|
| 3:08:17| No other lights on, so we have a motion by Commissioner Newton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11297)|
| 3:08:20| seconded by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11300)|
| 3:08:22| to approve the development plan for a bed and breakfast with up to two guest bedrooms in a historic Boyd Harvey house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11302)|
| 3:08:31| and one guest bedroom in the existing carriage house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| First staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11318)|
| 3:08:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11319)|
| 3:08:40| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11320)|
| 3:08:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| Next item is agenda item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| It's the presentation of a slate of planning commission officers for the 2022 calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11326)|
| 3:08:53| At this point, I'll turn it over to Commissioner Hill, who is the chair of the nominating committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11333)|
| 3:08:59| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11339)|
| 3:09:01| The nominating committee comprised of Commissioner Adams, Commissioner Newton, and me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11341)|
| 3:09:08| We've addressed, we'll bring forth some nominations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| but I also want to add that we may be bringing some by-law amendments in the next month or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11351)|
| 3:09:19| based on Commissioner Graf's comments from the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11359)|
| 3:09:24| We'd like to address some good comments that you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11364)|
| 3:09:29| and hopefully we'll bring some good creative ideas to amend the by-laws for all of us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11369)|
| 3:09:36| But in the meantime, the matter at hand is for nominations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| and our committee would like to nominate Commissioner Chair Pat Phillips as chair for a one-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11379)|
| 3:09:47| and nominate Vice Chair Scott Smith for a six-month term, and then we would come back in six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11387)|
| 3:09:55| I think his term, assuming his term expires, and deal with the vice chair vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11395)|
| 3:10:01| So you've heard the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| The floor is also open for nominations from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11403)|
| 3:10:07| Chair will recognize Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| I didn't understand what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11409)|
| 3:10:12| Are you nominating Pat Phillips for another year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11412)|
| 3:10:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11416)|
| 3:10:19| And Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| For six months, because his term will expire in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11423)|
| 3:10:29| Okay, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11429)|
| 3:10:34| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11434)|
| 3:10:37| Yeah, those are our nominations that we brought to the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11437)|
| 3:10:40| and like Chair Phillips said, he's accepting additional nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11440)|
| 3:10:45| If there's other nominations from the floor, we'll take those now, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11445)|
| 3:10:50| All right, so seeing none, hearing none, this will be on the agenda for the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11450)|
| 3:10:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11456)|
| 3:10:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| No other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11459)|
| 3:11:00| Anybody have any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11460)|
| 3:11:02| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11462)|
| 3:11:03| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11463)|
| 3:11:04| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11464)|
| 3:11:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=11465)|
