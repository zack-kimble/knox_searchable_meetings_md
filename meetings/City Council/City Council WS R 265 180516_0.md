| 0:01:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Well, we do have certainly a quorum, but we can't vote on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| We have a workshop and a hearing on the RECODE effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=83)|
| 0:01:30| which has begun, what, a year and a half ago now, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| And we have in our hands, I hope everybody has a copy of the first draft of the RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=97)|
| 0:01:47| I understand there are going to be three drafts before it comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| Gerald Green, I will ask you to introduce our consultants and we'll get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| I'll do some preliminary remarks just to let you know where we are in the follow-up of Vice Mayor Saunders' comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| about this being the first of three drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| This draft was released on March 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| We've had countless community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| I'd like to thank, there are some members of our stakeholder advisory committee, Amy Midas, Amy Nolan, Jennifer Roach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| John Sanders, who have really gone above and beyond in helping organize meetings with different business organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=139)|
| 0:02:28| the Chamber of Commerce, realtors, developers, and neighborhoods to provide opportunities for input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| This week we're holding a series of community open houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| We had our first one this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| We had a stakeholder committee meeting this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| We have a community meeting tomorrow afternoon in Fountain City at the Church of the Good Shepherd, Episcopal Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=163)|
| 0:02:53| We have one Friday morning at the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Community Clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| We have one Saturday morning at the Overcoming Believers Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| We have a meeting with the CCIM in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| So we're really going, I think, making a big step in an effort to get community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=185)|
| 0:03:14| The stakeholder advisory committee has provided great leadership and direction on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| as has a lot of members of the community and the city council members, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| The first draft comments, we've set a date of May 21st for those comments to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| and we've received a good number of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| We will take those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| The consultants will take the lead in addressing the comments in the second draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| That second draft will be provided to city and MPC staff for review prior to being released to the public sometime in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| In July we will also have the first draft of the updated zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| That zoning map will actually let people visualize on the ground where these standards will be applied in the new zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| So we anticipate quite a lot of comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| We'll take comments from the second draft in that draft zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| and work with the consultants to create a third draft that will be available in early fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| Again, I'll charge the council with adopting that by the end of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| because, quite frankly, I don't want to live with it any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| But more importantly, we need to get it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| so I understand that getting it right is more important than being timely with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| We do appreciate the efforts that you have made, the stakeholder advisory committee has made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| and especially the members of the community that have taken the time to review this, to provide comments to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| And with that, Arista Strungies and Chris Jeanette will lead just a brief overview of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| And our big goal tonight is to hear from you, hear comments, questions, and just identify issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| what has gone right, what we need to address, the comments you've heard from your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Well, thank you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Before you all get started, let me make one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| The first portion of this is for us, for council, to ask any questions we might have of the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| and anything they present, anything you might have read in the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| Then when we are finished, we will ask the public if they have comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| I hope whatever comments there are, they will be thoughtful and constructive comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| Anyhow, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Thank you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| And now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Well, thank you all for having us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| If you went to any of the presentations back in March, this PowerPoint is going to look very, very familiar to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| because it's essentially identical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| But, you know, we all like to go see the Marvel's Infinity Wars multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| so maybe we'll find Easter eggs in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| And I'll challenge Arista here that 15-minute time limit on the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| We're playing like this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| So in that event, if council members have questions as we're going along, just wave your hands, turn your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| I hope I see it, and we'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| So just a couple of housekeeping things before it starts, and no one can start the timer yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| This PowerPoint, as well as these banners that you see behind me, these are on display at the open houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| PDFs of all this material will be put on the Recode Knoxville website probably about Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| when we get the kind of PDF versions of them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| So no one has to frantically photograph or write down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| You can actually just download the actual documents themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| So, as you know, we are all here today to really, why are we updating the zoning code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| And the idea is that we really want to start taking land use policies that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| and start implementing them through zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Also create a document that is very easy to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| It's zoning, so it's going to be complex, but we think that there's ways to organize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| to rewrite it, so that it becomes a lot easier for people to know what happens on their lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| and in particular what happens on the lot next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| So that creates this predictability and transparency in the processes and the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| I think you probably remember from the last time, even early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| we talked about this issue of compartmentalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| And the idea here was really what we want to do is put things in their right places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| so you don't end up with a junk drawer of an article in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| where you just put everything that doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| So as you see, the first couple chapters, they're the introductory chapters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| The next set are the zoning districts, going from residential all the way to special purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| and overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Uses, it's a use matrix now, I'll describe that in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| Development standards, those include site development standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| which include things like accessory structures, exterior lighting, permitted encroachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| Rounding out that section is also parking and landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| And then administrators, that's the next section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| It's who does what, how do they do it, and what is the notice and the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| And that really describes all the different zoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| And then finally, how do you implement the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| What happens to nonconformities, and what are the enforcement provisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| So again, as I said, what we're trying to do is illustrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| If you have items that you think would be better served with more illustrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| we'd love to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| We took our first shot at it, and we know that we'll add more as more are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| And then doing things like defining all the different terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| and putting things into tables and matrices so they're easier to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| and understand what the requirements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| A couple key things to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| One of the things that we're dealing with is the idea of a zoning lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| Right now you have two maps in place, a parcel map and a ward map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| And surprise, they are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| And so the issue becomes if I own two pieces of property, contiguous, right next to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| and I'm a single-family house and I want to take my other piece of property that I own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| and put a garage on there, I can't do that unless I consolidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| which adds approval time, cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| So we're trying to find a way to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Most ordinances use what's called a zoning lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| which means if I own two lots contiguous, I can treat it as one lot for the purposes of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| And so we're trying to rectify that with what's going on with the building code, the GIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| and these two different maps, but it's a common technique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| Pretty much every other ordinance uses it, and we want to bring that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| Further, we also note that you did a parking update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| We've taken those and integrated them into this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| separated it into parking and landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| And then we also brought in the Cumberland and the South Waterfront form-based codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| Those two, we've basically brought them in as they are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| and then are looking for any feedback that we may need to do to tweak those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| There's no intent on taking them away from a form-based approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| The idea is really just to get them in there and align everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| So the first big chunk of the ordinance is a new use approach that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| and what we've done is two things that I think are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| The first is we've gone to a more generic use approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| When you see this illustration that's up on the PowerPoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| you see it used to have things like shoe store, record store, bookstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| What we've done is grouped them into a larger category called retail goods establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| and all these terms are defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| We know that there's a couple uses that people are still sensitive to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| so those are still pulled out and treated specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| things like a drive-through or an adult use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| They're not grouped in these larger categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| They're specifically called out and regulated, so that protection is in place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| The other thing we did was eliminated the cumulative or the pyramid approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| to the uses in zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| This used to be the clearest example of this is something like if I'm in a C3 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| I can have everything that's in the C2 district plus these uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| If I'm in the C4, I have the C3 plus these uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| As you see, it's a cascade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| You're just basically adding in the uses from each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| What happens is uses you want don't get into the districts you want them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| and uses you don't want can sometimes sneak through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| Sometimes making an amendment to an earlier district impacts all the subsequent districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| What we did was move to a very specific approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| where each district gets their own distinct set of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| They're not relying on any of the other districts there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| so it becomes much more clear what the form and function of the district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| When you open up the ordinance, this is actually from the current draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| you see the use table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| You see that as you go down, P means permitted, S means special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| It's a new version of use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| A blank spot indicates that it's prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| This allows you to access use permissions in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| The first is I can take a look, as shown in this example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| You probably can't really read it, but if you're looking at that use there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| that's the arrow, it's bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| You can go across the table and see which districts you can open up a bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| or tavern that you wanted to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| On the other hand, if I'm in the CN district, as is highlighted there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| I own a piece of property, I want to know what I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I can just go down the list, so it's a lot easier to get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| and understand what uses are wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| In particular, certain uses have standards, much like you do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| These have just been brought over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Some additional standards have been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| These apply whether you're permitted or special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| You have to comply with these, really meant to mitigate impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| Then finally, just to highlight some of the newest uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| we've integrated some of your recently adopted ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| things like the urban agriculture, which is the personal community and market garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Those have been brought in to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| Also, we've had to deal with social service uses, the full range of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| This is an issue that cities across the country are dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| and trying to figure out how to manage them properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Being upfront about it and tackling them head-on is the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| These are things like drug rehab, group homes, domestic violence shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| We're trying to figure out how to deal with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| what districts are appropriate for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Let's define them clearly and bring them into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| On the heavier side of things, we know Knoxville is a maker city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| so we want to make sure that you have the options for creative uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| things like food truck parks, where you take a piece of private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| and you create a kind of permanent food truck restaurant area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| Then things like craft industrial, which is a lower scale industrial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| that can do a lot of artisan industrial stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| as well as some traditional manufacturing on a very small, small scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| and integrate better into commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| Then finally, in a city like Knoxville, we're sure that in some neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| you have what was referred to as the old corner store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| which is a non-residential building that's in the residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| and typically was used just the corner shop where you went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| It could have been a hairdresser salon, but it's really the only one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| We wanted to address how to reuse those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| without having to go through a series of special approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| We created this use called the Neighborhood Non-Residential Reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| specifically for these existing structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| This isn't applied to new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| This is an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| It has a very limited number of uses that are allowed within it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| so that they maintain that compatibility with the residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| So it's kind of like a use that holds a couple of other uses in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| It's really meant to address the compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| You see a picture of one there on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| It's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| It is not from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| It's from another place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| But that's really the intent and kind of what we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| that kind of neighborhood reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| And it's a way to do this without having to go through variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| And then finally, temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| We've tried to address the full range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| We brought in the regulations that you have and added some other ones in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| including a reference to mobile food units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| Again, because this is the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| we're only dealing with temporary uses that occur on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Zoning doesn't regulate things like street fest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| So if I were to have a carnival in a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| that's what's regulated by the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| If I were to set up some food trucks or some sales outdoors in a larger parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| this is regulated by the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And so we've got standards in place for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| They require a temporary use permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| which will be used to help determine the time frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| And we think it's a very useful way to bring some creative uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| and some opportunities, local opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| here into the city through the temporary use provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| So with that, I don't know if anybody has any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| but I'm going to turn it over to Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| We only have 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| I took like 10, so just go quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| There's more after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| I'll give you more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| and I want to apologize to the audience for not having the projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| I have no technical skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| and the person in our office who has technical skills is at home fixing dinner for his daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=924)|
| 0:15:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| So I wanted to give a brief overview just of the districts that are within the draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| that you guys are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Obviously there's much more detailed information in the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| so I'm just going to try and provide a brief overview of our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| and how we arrived and the general purpose of each of the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| that you'll see within the draft ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| So as part of our process, we evaluated all of the existing districts within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| and we really compared them to on the ground as developed conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| to kind of see where there might be gaps or areas for consolidation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| and we've made some recommendations both in the residential and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| and industrial as well as the special purpose and the overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| So beginning here with the EN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| you can see the top row here is what we're recommending as our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| All of the residential are RN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| That's residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| It's a new nomenclature for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| So the EN district is a combination of the current EN1 and EN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| maintaining the same minimum square footage requirements as the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| The residential neighborhood 1 district is essentially a combination of the current R1 and R1E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| and what we did was we took the 5,000-square-foot lot area minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| that's pretty much part of all of the residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| and adjusted it for each one of these to match the development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| In our RN1, we're kind of memorializing that those are larger lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| with the 10,000-square-foot minimum lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| For the residential neighborhood 2 district, we've moved to a 7,000-square-foot lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| That was the previous R1A district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| and that's really to get at what the purpose of that district originally was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| which was to kind of accommodate low- to medium-density single-family residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| RN3 and RN4 are two brand-new neighborhood districts for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| and these allow a variety of different housing types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| also including multifamily and townhouse, which is allowed by special use in the RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| and multifamily up to six-unit buildings would be permitted within the RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| on corner lots and corner abutting lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| These two districts are really geared at getting toward that missing middle housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| so not thinking about single-family and two-family and just large multifamily projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| but how can we start to see the three flats, the four flats, the five flats, the six flats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| that really fill in those housing gaps within certain areas of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| The residential neighborhood 5 takes the place of the current R2 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| That's the city's general residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Its mixed residential allows for all different types of dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| The RN6 is a replacement for the R3, which is the city's current multifamily district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| a little bit denser in terms of single-family being allowed on 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| townhouses on 2,000, and multifamily on smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| And then finally, the RN7, it's a brand-new district as proposed in the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| and it's a pure multifamily district, so no single-family or two-family would be permitted in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| and that's really designed to be the densest residential development within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| that would get mapped kind of according to specific areas of growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| or where that density might be appropriate for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| So there are some design standards built into the basic residential districts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| These are very basic standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| We're talking about 15 percent minimum transparency for the front of a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| A primary entrance is required to be oriented toward the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| as well as distinguished through some sort of architectural feature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| and requirements for the width of front-loaded attached garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| just to make sure that they're not dominant on the front of a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Before you go on, I know Councilman Roberto has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| When you're looking at the residential districts, kind of big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| what priorities were you looking at addressing when you were first getting into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| From the very beginning of this process, one of the very first observations that we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| was that the zoning districts that are within the current ordinance don't match the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| of really any of the neighborhoods of the city that are kind of developed on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| A 5,000-square-foot minimum lot area—was it 7,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| I keep saying 5,000. No one's corrected me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| A 7,500-minimum square-foot lot area kind of treated them all as though they were uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1186)|
| 0:19:54| and that really wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| So in order to make sure that we were addressing areas where nonconformities were popping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| to allow people to really maintain and improve their homes more easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| we wanted to look at actual on-the-ground developed conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| and reorient the residential districts toward the character of the city's neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| not to treat them all the same, but to actually look and see what the developed condition was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| and to really gear the district standards toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| And I just wanted to ask about accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| Are those allowed in all residential zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| Yep. We're going to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| We'll answer it very quickly, but we'll come back to it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| The way that it's proposed in the current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| if you have 5,000 square feet of lot area, you can put on an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Now, that doesn't mean that it's—while you have the permission to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| there's other things in play, including kind of the size of your principal structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| because remember there's building coverage and paved surface coverage requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| that limit how much of the lot can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| So that plays into that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| So you may have a smaller lot, but you may not have enough room to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| We also have standards on the minimum and maximum sizes of the accessory dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| and their relationship to the size of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| So there's limitations on them, but it is a blanket permission, as it's written right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| to allow them on any lot that has 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| And that's by right, not by use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| No, it's by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Okay. So if you meet the standards, you put an accessory dwelling unit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Okay. Has there been any thought to the way that our residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| single-family, low-density zones currently wouldn't allow those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| So has there been any thought about the impact that that might have in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| that don't have access to this now, such as R1 and R1E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1311)|
| 0:22:01| Yes, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| The idea was if we're opening it up this much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| this is now going to go into the other residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| But the idea was really to put this out there and take the public's temperature on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| Our feedback to date is really split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| There are some people that are very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| They look at it as creating a kind of de facto duplex in single-family neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| while others are very supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| A lot of communities are moving to just allowing them by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| considering the need for different types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| As Chris explained, the missing middle districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| this is another form of building in a way of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| It's also a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| They originally were called things like granny flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| So if you have your parents want to move back in with you, you can use this as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| So that's kind of the other considerations that were in play as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Well, if we look at the current setup for R1 and R1E, that's set up for single-family, low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| My question to you is, if you add in accessory dwelling units into those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| are they still single-family, low-density areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| I mean, I would argue that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| It's really an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| I mean, the perception is some people may not want that additional density in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| But if you look at traditional single-family neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| that developed kind of in other parts of the country, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| they developed with accessory dwelling units on them and are considered single-family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| So it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| This is a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| On our end, we understand that people are sensitive to it and the nature of single-family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| Quite frankly, when most places do allow them, they are actually requiring a larger lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| So things like the EN and the R1 district and the R1E would typically be in another community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| where they're most allowed, where they're targeted at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| as opposed to smaller lots that may not have the area available to build an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| What's the closest functional equivalent to an accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| in something that we could think about right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| Would a duplex be the functional equivalent of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| Well, no, because a duplex would be usually they're relatively equal-sized dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| of significant size and scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| The accessory dwelling unit is limited in scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| It can't be very big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| It's limited to, what, 40%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| I think we limited 40% of the floor area of the primary structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Or 1,000 square feet, so whichever is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| Well, and, you know, just thinking about duplexes, there are in the 2018 one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| there are restrictions on where you can put a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| And so, you know, there are certain zones where you can't put one now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| but we're also looking at the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| You know, is it on an area where there's a collector street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| You know, is there a desirable buffer between different zones that exist there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| Is there some aesthetic element that's added well to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| So I just have some real concerns about accessory dwelling units in all residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| I think there's some really good positive things you can get that, you know, you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| and I've heard other folks mention as well with regard to accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| but this is a pretty significant change from what is currently allowed in R1 and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| I think we've got to be careful about making such a significant change in our primary residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| Keep in mind that folks that have moved into these areas are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| this is typically their largest investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| And they're probably making those investments thinking that there's not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| a lot of structural change to the neighborhoods where they're going to be moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| So I know you're going to talk about it further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| but I thought since we're in residential, it was a good part to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Well, that's basically what I said is what I was going to say in that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| It's as good a spot as any to discuss this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| We know it's a hot button issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| Like I said, we've heard from both sides on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| People like it, people who don't want to see the neighborhoods densified in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| So, yeah, I have a feeling this discussion will keep going until we get to the end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Well, Gerald, are these forbidden in all zones now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| I mean, because they're everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| I mean, these accessory dwelling units are all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| So what, I mean, they didn't get there by, did they get there before we changed the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| They may have gotten there before we changed the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| And I can put myself as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| We have a basement apartment, a walk-out basement apartment in our home that's zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| And it would not be allowed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| The home was built in 1941.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| I have no idea when the accessory apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I ride my bike around and I go through neighborhoods and I see an R1 and R1E districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1628)|
| 0:27:17| garage apartments, a door that's obviously to a basement apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| I think, I don't know the answer to how they were put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Maybe they were put in before they were permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Well, I think there's an accessory building, like a two-car garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| and then there's an accessory dwelling unit, which the distinction being there's got to be a bathroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| and a separate kitchen facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| But they're all over the place in Sequoia, Westmoreland, Dean Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| West Hills, there's accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| And then some have come back and added the bedroom or a bathroom maybe after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| I think one of the ways to deal with it is to deal with it on the lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| and then the percentage of coverage of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| So some of these lots in some of these areas are sizable that you've got enough room to put it on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1688)|
| 0:28:16| and be discreet about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| And there are certain subdivisions where they are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| So we had a big fight in here a few years ago on increasing the size of an accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1704)|
| 0:28:32| and above the minimum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| But I think the way to deal with it is a lot coverage and a lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| and try to figure out how to permit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| But try to figure out how to limit it based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| So when you say you're getting feedback, I guess I have a two-part question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| and I don't want to get hung up because you guys were doing a 15-minute presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Harold said that we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| We're realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| He's got plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| We've got to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| So when you say you're hearing feedback, are we discerning where the feedback is coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| Because I know there are some neighborhoods where there's a majority in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| and there are some neighborhoods where it's like 99.999% in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| So are we discerning where the feedback is coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| That's statistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| And I'll try to answer that question because I'm more familiar with where the commenters live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| or where they represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| And so we're trying to keep track of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| There are some that are more challenging than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| We'll get a letter from an organization that has one point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| But does that represent all the people in the neighborhoods that those commenters live in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| That's a challenge and something that we can't answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| but we are trying to discern where the comments are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| And then the second thing is when you look at an accessory dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| there are some accessory structures that are built as a garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| and then later on it's like, well, it's got this attic space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| Little Johnny is 21 now, and we don't want him to live in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| He can move out here or, you know, Grandma can live out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| Anyway, I think that's one type of accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| But when you're in the neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| and they're envisioning an entire house being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| like literally this is a secondary house on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| That's kind of not even like a cottage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| There's a distinction of what the primary use of the structure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| If it's your three-car garage with an apartment above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| that's not necessarily conducive to renting out to four college students versus. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| And Chris and Arista mentioned it slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| The standards as proposed now limit the accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| to 40 percent of the square footage of the principal house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| So that limits it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| You know, if you have a 2,000-square-foot home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| then your accessory dwelling unit, the maximum size is 800 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| which is pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| And we may want to tweak that, I think, going back to Councilman Wallace's comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| about minimum lot size and lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| We'll look at other ways to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| If this becomes too contentious as a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| maybe it's a special use that would require approval by MPC before it could be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| And it's trying to balance the protection of our existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| and the need to increase availability of housing to try to address affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| and also places providing opportunities for people to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| as Knoxville becomes more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| How do we house these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| And I'll just throw in, having lived in a community that 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| allowed accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| it wasn't like they were popped up at every home in every neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| It was not a plethora of accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| It's a big undertaking to convert a garage to an accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| and then to become basically a landlord or to face that challenge of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| and I mentioned that I have an apartment in our basement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| and the two proposals that have come up are my daughter comes to live with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| or my in-laws come to live with us, both of which have positive and negative impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| So it's a big decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| I wasn't going to make you go there, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| I wasn't going to make you tell us which one's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| And maybe the approach is look at it as a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| consider them on a case-by-case basis and see what impact they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| Address them that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| If there's a real hesitancy to permit them as a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| throughout all the residential single-family districts with some standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| we'll review them on a case-by-case basis and address the impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| and come back and have a review in a year or two to see if it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Well, it's certainly an attempt, at least in my mind, to address growing density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| which, in my opinion, we are going to experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| given the growth projections for this specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Before Chris kicks back in, I just want to kind of echo what Gerald said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| From other areas we've worked where we've allowed for accessory dwelling units in bigger cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| there isn't a line out the door at the building permit office looking to construct these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| It doesn't really explode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Some people who have been looking to do it do come in and do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| There are some conversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| But it's not like every lot that can have one will have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| I don't think that fear should weigh too much in that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| So back to residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| So we were talking about design standards that are built into the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| for single family as well as for townhouse and multifamily developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| These are just basic standards, consistency of facade treatments wrapping around all sizes of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| three-dimensional features at entrances, basic minimum transparency requirements, those types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| as well as the standards for the EN district have been clarified and illustrated within the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| so those are a little bit easier to understand now as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Moving to the commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Coming out, we have what are kind of considered the lower intensity or transitional commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| Those are the O office zoning district and the neighborhood commercial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| Important thing to note right off the bat is that both of these districts have a square footage cap of 5,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| in gross floor area for non-residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| and that's really to ensure that we're maintaining compatibility with the surrounding residential neighborhoods here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| There are a couple ways that non-residential uses can exceed those caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| If they're meeting certain above and beyond design requirements that do keep them in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| and maintain that compatibility with the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| So the O office zoning district is a transitional neighborhood, really designed to be more horizontally mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| Residence is mixing with low-intensity office, service, and retail uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| And then the neighborhood commercial zoning district is slightly more intense than the O office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| Some low-intensity mixed use in terms of apartments above retail on the first floor, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| So moving into really the main commercial districts here, the CG general commercial zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| the highway commercial zoning district, and the regional commercial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| The CG is really intended to be a mixed-use walkable environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| So a mix of retail, personal service, office, residential, really recreating that character and that walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| that feel of the traditional commercial corridors and nodes within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| The CH highway commercial zoning district is a bit more high-intensity than the general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| really accommodating uses that are more predominantly auto-oriented in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| These are the types of things that may have permanent outdoor storage or service areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| And then finally, the regional commercial zoning district, big things like malls, shopping centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| attracting a lot of cars, requiring a lot of parking, those would fall into the CR regional commercial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| Another important thing to note about these commercial districts is that we have split some of them into tiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| So the basic districts that I was just talking about, the CG, the CH, and the CR, those don't have any design standards built into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| What we've done is that we've created additional levels of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| So we have a CG2 district, a CG3, a CH2, and a CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| And what we've done here is we're allowing a little bit of additional development intensity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| primarily in terms of additional height in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| And what we're asking in return is a higher quality of design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| So we're requiring façade design elements, roof design elements, and additional levels of transparency, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2249)|
| 0:37:39| All of these are listed within the ordinance as kind of a return for allowing that additional development potential within these districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| And it's important to note, and you'll hear Arista talk about it in a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| that anywhere we're requiring this additional level of design, it's going to undergo a higher design review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2270)|
| 0:37:59| a higher level of site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Well, let me ask a question about the building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| I notice there are various different heights here from 85 down to 35 feet and from 65 to, well, 65, 70 to 40 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2286)|
| 0:38:16| depending on the CH1, the O, the C, and the CG1, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| I guess, logically, I think that that is a market decision as to height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| Now, a step back might be preferable to not create a canyon or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| but kind of walk me through your thought process to get to those height restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| Yeah, it's these additional heights that we're allowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| The base heights are pretty much based on what's within the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| What we're assuming with the CG2, CG3, and those additional ones that I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| is just allowing a little bit of additional density anywhere from five to seven stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| I mean, we're talking about 40 feet, I think, up to 70 to 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| Yeah, so it would be about four to seven stories, and that's really kind of, we've found in previous communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| the kind of sweet spot where, depending on where you're allowing that height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| it would be more kind of a nodal development where you would want to see seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| potentially eight-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| And those are the types of buildings in those types of environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| that's the kind of height that you can get that's generally okay with neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| and that doesn't create too much disturbance around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Just explain the theory behind a 5,000 square foot maximum gross floor space in an office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2374)|
| 0:39:46| So I have an acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| I'm limited to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| Do you want to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Okay, I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| The idea here is these are going to be in close proximity, if not directly abutting residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| It's a very, very local small-scale commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Both the office and the CN districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| And the intent is really to kind of make sure that these businesses stay small in scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| so it's the 5,000 square foot limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| However, there is a process in place where you go through when you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| and during site plan review, if you meet these additional criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| you can be bigger than 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| But it's really looking at things like its compatibility with the adjacent residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| making sure that it incorporates pedestrian-scale features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| And so that's the thinking behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| And just in those two districts, the others don't have any limitations like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| It's just kind of like you wouldn't want a Walmart to go down right in the middle of a single-family neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| We're looking at buffering and transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| Walmart's 40,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| 5,000 square feet in office space is very limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Now, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| It depends on what the zoning map comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| But if O-1 is going to equate to O, 5,000 feet is very limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2466)|
| 0:41:14| We have a lot of office buildings that are in close proximity to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| Maybe not abut residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| It may abut other commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| If we have it on the front end of an off-their-main artery into a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| the first quarter mile may be commercial, and it may be all zoned office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| and they're all 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| It's very limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| I think 5,000 square feet on a CN is very limiting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| There's cases where neighborhood centers are bigger than 5,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2503)|
| 0:41:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| I think those need to be addressed and reconsidered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| or at least see how the zoning map pulls out on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| It may be the zoning map because those may be more intensely developed areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| Even if they are right on the residential, that's more appropriate for a CG or a CR in those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| This is a good thing for us to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| just kind of where they are on the map and what sizes they are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| I want to reiterate what Arista just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| What we'll be looking at in the mapping will be critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| in a number of the areas that are currently zoned C1 would not be appropriate for CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| I wonder why some of the current C1 zones, Rocky Hill, why is that zoned neighborhood commercial C1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2554)|
| 0:42:44| That's not a neighborhood commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| It's more community general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| We'll have to look very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| The shopping center in Sequoia, that's greater than 5,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| I don't see that as a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Under the intent of our proposed zoning ordinance, that would not be a neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| That would be commercial general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| But some of those places have held tightly onto that C1 as a real protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| So you open it up to CG1, it's a pretty big jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| We've accepted reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| That may be a challenge for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| I think where there are former residential houses like Newcomb and Chambliss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| where there are small residential houses that were 1,400, 1,500 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| and they were converted from residential to office, that kind of makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| There have been cases in there where they've torn a couple down and built a 5,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| Or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| I just think you need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| 5,000 square feet is pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| We'll look at it carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| I guess my question is, and you may have mentioned this earlier, I guess two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| One is what is the timeline for the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Because I think, and then when we're looking at our predominant, our predominant current zone is C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2646)|
| 0:44:15| And where does, how are most of those properties going to be zoned on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2655)|
| 0:44:25| Because it looks to me, I mean most of our, you know, Kingston Pike, Broadway, Chapman is C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| But I wouldn't think of it as walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| But it's also not C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| It's not zoned C4 and doesn't have those kind of intense uses either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| So I just wanted to get the thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| And our schedule for the draft zoning map would be in July when the second draft of the zoning ordinance comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2684)|
| 0:44:53| There will be some tweaks to the zoning ordinance that will impact how we map different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| And we want to get at least to the second draft and have that in mind as we do the mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| The C3 will largely be the new CG category, the commercial general category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2704)|
| 0:45:13| And within that there are three tiers, the base CG, the CG1 with some design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2713)|
| 0:45:21| and the CG2 with some design standards based on the urbanness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| Going out Kingston Pike, maybe Western Plaza may even be CH1 with some design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2726)|
| 0:45:36| because of its intensity of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Then going towards to North Shore CG and then from North Shore West to a certain point, CH,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2738)|
| 0:45:48| which is the highway commercial, and Turkey Creek and areas like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| West Town Mall would be CR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| And that's just a general thinking that there will be some tweaks and rethinking of that as we look more closely at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2757)|
| 0:46:06| And so the 1, 2s and 3s would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| You would have to rezone it if you wanted between those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| And we may, we'll assign, we'll propose designations that would have like CG1 or CG2 on that initial map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2774)|
| 0:46:24| and based on comments from council, from our stakeholder advisory committee and property owners, we'll tweak that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2784)|
| 0:46:33| Because I think this process will really, the gas will really be put on it once that map comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2793)|
| 0:46:41| and people look at the properties under the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| Has that been your experience in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| Mapping is always more interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| So just flipping through some quick illustrations of the design standards that are built into those zoning districts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2823)|
| 0:47:11| And then moving on to downtown Knoxville, which is a new zoning district in the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| It comprises four separate sub-districts, and those are loosely based on the existing downtown design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2837)|
| 0:47:26| So the first of them is the boulevard sub-district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| These are for sort of the periphery of downtown buildings, further setback, larger open lawn spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| a lot more height, structures with variable setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| The traditional grid sub-district, which would be the majority of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| the most intensely developed portions of downtown, allowing for more height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| really acknowledging that traditional 300 by 300 grid pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| reinforcing sort of the character of development that's already predominant downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| The historic core sub-district, which acknowledges the development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| and uses that are predominant on areas of Gay Street and all the way up to Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| And then finally the warehouse sub-district, which would be primarily located along Jackson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| around the rail yard, really allowing, again, that pattern of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| and that pattern of development and that unique character that's within that area to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| and to be reinforced through the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| So there's a map within the draft that you guys can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| These banners printed out behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| Of what our thinking is, again, this is based off of the sub-districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| that were originally identified in the downtown design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| And the design standards within those sub-districts have also been illustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| for clarity within the draft ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| So moving on, the form-based districts, Cumberland and the South Waterfront districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| those were previously standalone form-based districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| They've been pulled apart, reorganized, and shuffled back into this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| so that they match the structure and the language or the vocabulary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| that we're using here for consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| The districts were added to the use matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| and other standards within these ordinances were shuffled into the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| where they make sense where they belong now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Important to note that the sign regulations that were in these need to get moved over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| into the sign code, and the existing graphics from these ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| have not yet been moved over into the draft as you see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| That will happen in subsequent drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| The industrial districts, down at the bottom here, general industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| and heavy industrial, we have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| There's only so much you can do with those types of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| Those would remain largely as they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| We have added a few additional industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| The first of those is the IOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| It's the Industrial Office Park Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| It's really intended to accommodate larger scale office parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| with some light manufacturing use, as well as ancillary services for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| People that are there during the day need a place to go get their dry cleaning done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| or to eat lunch, so those types of things would also be permitted within the IOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| The IMU is the Industrial Mixed Use District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| and this is really intended to accommodate those parts of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| that were previously purely industrial, but where you're starting to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| some of these buildings start to move out of purely industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| They might be old at this point and not really suitable for their original use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| but they're great old buildings, so we want to see them reused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| So the IMU allows for a range of uses that might make sense there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| We usually tell people it's kind of easy to imagine these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| It's where a dog daycare will pop up, a CrossFit gym, breweries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| Those types of uses often find homes in some of these older industrial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| Then finally, the IRD, Research and Development Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| This is similar to the IOP but more tech-oriented in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| so it's large-scale office and research uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| It could be things like pilot plants or prototype manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| again with ancillary uses for the employees that are there during the daytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| Then moving on to special purpose and overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| These districts are essentially as within the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| So special purpose districts include the General Agricultural Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| For those areas of the city that are still in agricultural use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| an OS Parks and Open Space Zoning District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| which is really oriented more toward active park and recreation type uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| and a Natural Areas Zoning District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| which is more intended to be a preservation type district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| for areas that might have significant natural resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| that we want to ensure are maintained over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Then finally, the overlay districts, the H Historic Overlay District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| That's a district that's in the current ordinance that's getting moved over into the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| The same thing with the Neighborhood Conservation Overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| and the Technology Park Overlay District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Those are moving from the current ordinance into the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| In that particular suggestion down there under criteria for selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3107)|
| 0:51:54| having been on the Historic Zoning Commission for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| one thing we always did was ask for some vote of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| that were being considered for an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| And I notice that's not mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| I don't know if that's something that could be added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| but I would certainly hope you would consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| And again, these were just brought over from the current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| The challenge is how do you define residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| Are they the renters who may be moving out next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Are they the property owners who live in Arkansas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| If my wife and I disagree, whose vote counts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| I think we'll work on that, but I think there are some real challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| How do we gather that vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Do we set up a special election and have people come vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| Do we go door to door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Do we do a survey that might not be able to be verified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| So I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| The challenge is if we do it, how do we manage it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| No, I understand the challenge, but I think we need some indication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| Other than just public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| because public meetings sometimes are not reflective of the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| That's our challenge on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| So we'll research it, but how to manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| And we'll look at other communities to see if they require voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| How do they manage that vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| So we covered the hottest topic on this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| but just to say that we've looked comprehensively at accessory structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| regulating the usual suspects, things like detached garages, fences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| freestanding structures, home occupations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| including things like solar panels and private wind turbines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| And this is where you will find, right now, the accessory dwelling unit standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| We kind of talked about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Happy to take more questions on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| This is usually where I explained it, and I got to do it earlier on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| So I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| If you guys are good, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| We also clarified permitted encroachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| This is similar to what you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| I've got a follow-up on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| I think Director Green had mentioned this about duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| Or maybe you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| I can't remember now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| The accessory dwelling unit has to be 40% of the principal house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| Was that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Can't exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Can't exceed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| It's a maximum or 1,000, whichever one is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| 1,000 square feet or 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| If we were to follow the one-year plan with regard to duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| then you could say, well, I'm going to reduce the size of my duplex down to this level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| and call it an accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| and escape all of the discussions that were had about location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| and other issues that we'd already addressed in the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| And so I think that just goes on to show that there's some reason why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| some of those points were made in the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| And just saying accessory dwelling units everywhere may not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3311)|
| 0:55:20| Looking at the type of zone, whether or not it's ever had such a thing allowed in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3320)|
| 0:55:27| And, of course, I don't want you to take it the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| I'm not saying don't do them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| I'm saying look at where you're putting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| And then if the rules would allow for a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| it seems to me like, I mean, I asked you what the functional equivalent of this thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| and I don't know that there necessarily is one, but certainly a duplex is close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| I think we could agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Wouldn't we want to have the same requirements looking at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| are you in a location that's appropriate for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| So not to go back to accessory dwelling units too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| but I do think this is an important change that we need to really seriously consider before implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| So as part of the accessory structure section, we do have the permitted encroachments table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| and this talks about things like eaves and chimneys and bay windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| and how much they can encroach into a required setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| This is what you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| The numbers have in many cases have been carried over from the current one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| allowing, say, a three-foot encroachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Really meant to create flexibility and creativity in the architecture of structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| a fairly common provision within all zone ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| As part of this, we clarified the instance of what's a yard versus what is a setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| and the way that we've addressed this in here, it takes a second to kind of wrap your mind around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| but it makes sense as you kind of dig into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| A setback is the required minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| If it says you have to have a minimum setback of 25 feet, that's your required setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| What we have considered and defined as a yard is that area between the building face and the appropriate lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| So your front yard may be bigger than your required setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| because you've setbacked further than you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| One of the things that's important about that is that if you just say certain accessory structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| or things can't be located in a required setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| say I can't put it in the required front setback and you don't specify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| you mean the whole front yard, everything from the front of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| people will put a swimming pool in their front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| So we needed to be very careful about things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| For the most part, everything's logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| We're just trying to catch the kind of big picture items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| and make sure that we're careful about their placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| So that's when you see yard versus setback, that's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| For the most part, we brought in the current parking ordinance that you recently adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| What we did was some alignment with the rest of the updated draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| So when you looked at the uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| we had to update the uses and their parking requirements to match our use table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| It reduces interpretation because basically the uses you have all have an assigned parking requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| if such parking is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Brought in the Cumberland Avenue form-based district, their parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| those are moved wholesale into the parking section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| And we did create three new things, some supplemental provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| We addressed off-street loading because that wasn't addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| new rules on storage of commercial vehicles and storage of recreational vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| So those three provisions, those are new to that chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| We also created some, we took the landscape requirements from parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| used it as a basis and enhanced them a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| One of the things to clarify is that landscape is required for multifamily, townhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| and non-residential, including mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| This does not apply to single-family or two-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| What we've said is enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Right now we're looking at the option of certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| You see some italics up there I know that say something about a maintenance bond for the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| We have received pretty unanimous pushback on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| and I think we've given up the fight, so we're not even going to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| That essentially using the CFO may be the better way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| is the better way and an easier way to get the landscaping in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| So in addition to the landscaping required in the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| which is along the edges and within the interior of the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| we have a couple of other new standards we've added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| So you see here these are illustrations from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| This is the screening of the outside of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| This is the interior parking lot requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Again, these have been carried over from your current parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| But then we've said for things like multifamily or non-residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| that's set back further from the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| we'd like some site landscaping between the building and the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| so there's some requirements for that in place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| Obviously, I believe if you're less than 10 feet from the lot line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| you're not going to be able to fit in much landscaping, and that's exempted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| Also created two sets of buffer yards, a Class A, which is the smaller one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| and a Class B buffer, which is the larger dimension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| and really kind of oriented these where certain incompatible uses or districts meet up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| So it's a non-residential use in a residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| or where a residential district abuts a non-residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| We've got different classes of buffers for those to maintain that compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| We're almost near the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| So applications, the things you see quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| We've basically outlined who the ordinance administrators are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| You see the usual, the groups on their city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| MPC, Board of Zoning Appeals, and various administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| One thing we wanted to point out is two groups were eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| based on how we structured out the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| and this would be the Downtown Design Review Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| and the Infill Housing Design Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| The intent here was to take the standards that they're always evaluating the development in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| and build them directly into the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| So we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| That's why you see that broad range of residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| are really getting at kind of what's on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| so that infill development matches its surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| And as Chris explained, kind of creating those design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| within the downtown district and the sub-districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| as we continue to look at those and refine those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| to create a much more easier administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| You'll see, again, the application processes are spelled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| so this really talks about what notice is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| who do I give my application to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| We think this table sums it up nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| It comes directly from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| And then we also kind of kept many of the current applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| maybe just a few tweaks to kind of clarify approval standards and timeframes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| The idea here is these are kind of set the way that they operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| things like making map amendments and text amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| So these have just been maintained, maybe cleaned up a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| So that's really the amendments, variance, certificate of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| and the zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| A couple of the new ones, special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| This is replacing use on review approved by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| It's all the S's that you see within the use matrix up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| We've got it where site plan review is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| as part of the special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| We've also created what we call an administrative modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| This is kind of similar to baby variance, if you want to look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| These are approved by the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Very limited threshold that we can continue to refine if that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| It says 10% of any district dimensional standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| or 10% of the required parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| They can make modifications to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| So if I need to go, you know, I require 10 feet of side yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| and I only have nine, that's the type of administrative modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| that could be granted by the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| And the decisions can be appealed to the zoning board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| Site plan review, really trying to clarify what goes under site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| As you probably guessed, as Chris mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| the higher level of site plan review is under the administrative review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| This committee was established as part of the South Waterfront form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| so we're just carrying them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| We'll be looking at the districts that have the higher levels of design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| So this is things like the EN neighborhoods, the CG2, CG3, CH2, CR2, CUSW, and DK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3782)|
| 1:03:12| I think I got them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| But it's your downtown, your form-based, and then these higher level design ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| Other things, like other new development, like a townhouse, multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| all the kind of bigger scale, more intense things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| and things like parking lots would be reviewed by the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| And you would see the site plans for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| And those would be administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| And then finally, a couple of new applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| The first is a zoning interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| This happens now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| We're just kind of memorializing it within the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| It's interpreting the zoning provisions by the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| So that's just something we're bringing in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| We can all ignore zoning certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| Based on conversations that we had after we drafted it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| we realized that it's a redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| Basically, the zoning administrator and the city offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| are checking everything that's coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| so we don't need to create a redundant level of paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| So let's all pretend that the middle one isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| And then the temporary use, which I talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| which would be granted by the zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| to deal with those temporary uses that I outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| They can work on timeframes and additions and attach those to the approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| And then finally, in the administrative section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| kind of one of the biggest changes is we've created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| a more modern planned development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| This replaces things like your RP districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| the residential planned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| This will be an approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| It will not be a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| So that's one of the biggest changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| It's also not tied to a type of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| whether that's commercial or office or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| It's a kind of general approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| Within this, what happens is the way we've restructured it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| is it works with whatever the base district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| So whatever your zone is that you're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| say you're in a CG district, a commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| and you want to do something that requires a bit more height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| a bit kind of tighter setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| a variety of things that aren't really –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| it's an innovative design that you want to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| and the district's not allowing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| You can apply for a planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| and essentially saying, I would like to do this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| I'm working with the CG district standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| which is what I am zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| and what I would like to do is modify this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| And that's what this process allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| However, one key part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| is that it requires public benefits and amenities in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| This is a negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| This isn't just a blanket permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| So when you come in, you have to say things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| it might be affordable housing, it might be senior housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| it might be preservation of outdoor space or creation of a plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| There has to be a give and take with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| in order to get that approval and permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| Just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| because I think we're constantly trying to take what we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| and understand, which is the current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| and mesh it up with the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| Zoning administrator, is that Peter Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| or is that Scott Elder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| You would be that designee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| So I guess one of my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| are something we're considering in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| Is that a lot more work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| What's the workload look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Well, anyway, I brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| No, it's definitely more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Don't you want to come to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| Why don't you come to the microphone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3990)|
| 1:06:37| And give us your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| I'm Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Director of Plans Review and Inspections for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| It's definitely more work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| but this is the direction that the city is heading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| and we've had internal conversations at the staff level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| at the deputy mayor level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| and we understand this is the direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| and we're committed to providing the resources necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| to fully implement whatever is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Any other questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| I'm always at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Councilman St. Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| I wanted to go back a bit to social service agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| I know that was much earlier on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| but it seemed like there were a lot of different types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| of agencies lumped together in non-residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| and I think different agencies have different needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| There may be some that would be better suited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| for a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Could you talk about that some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| Yeah, they are separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| What that slide showed was just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| I was showing that this category has all these individual uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| They are all regulated separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| So drug and alcohol rehabilitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| residential facility is separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Drug treatment clinic, which is a methadone clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| we've taken the drug name out of the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| is a separate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Domestic violence shelters in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| I know there's sensitivities to that because of privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| so you can't make them a special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I mean you can make them a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| but you shouldn't make them a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| because you don't want to publicize where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| as their crisis shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Social service centers, it's another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| that we've distinguished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Group homes, what am I missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| I think, so they're all separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| So what we can do is we look at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| because we are looking at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| and we see things like a children's home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| and a domestic violence shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| can fit into a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| In particular, they're very quiet uses by intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| whereas others, such as a drug treatment clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| is a bit more of a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| So you can look at the use table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| see them in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| and see where we need to adjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| accordingly the use permissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Council Member Berto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| And I just want to start off by piggybacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| a little bit on something the Vice Mayor had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| and that would be challenging that as you go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| wherever there's a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| for putting in public input to be sought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| I would really strongly recommend doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| It's certainly been, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| the experience of everyone on Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| and so many folks watching at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| and here in the audience today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| that when we encourage that kind of discussion and discourse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| that it really makes for a better development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| Now, I'm not so sure that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| legislate that into this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| It may be more of a policy recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| but it certainly would give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| I know we've mentioned several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| in discussions here at Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| asking have you had a discussion about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| And sometimes the parties haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| and it would be a good idea to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| With regard to mixed-use developments in RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| or in this first draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| one thing that I have heard from some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| who live in those areas now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| is issues with regard to noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| and issues with regard to other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| that you might be exposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| because you're in a mixed-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| Now, we're not mixing uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| where you're going to be residential with industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| and that's one thing we have to explain to folks all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| But could you maybe address a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| ways that we're protecting residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| who might be moving into a mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| from excessive noise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| You're not going to be able to get rid of all the noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| or other issues that might impact enjoyment of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| Well, zoning only does part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| and that's only part of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| And we can kind of update what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| We've added more exterior lighting standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| so that when lighting is done on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| we're trying to control for glare and light trespass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| so things like that, like a visual light pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| as they call it, we're trying to minimize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| That's one of the areas that we're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| But when you start getting into...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| You know, we did put some standards in with some uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| and again, it's kind of looking at that use mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| trying to make sure that it's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| that they're not working against each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| that they're working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| But things like noise are really controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| by other codes of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| So it's things...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| There's usually a noise ordinance all on its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| that addresses something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| that's not part of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| and it's not really a zoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| of how we could regulate noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| It kind of extends beyond zoning's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Is it something we would look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| What types of uses would be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| abutting directly with residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| whether it's mixed use or otherwise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Yeah, I mean, essentially, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| It's looking at the use mixes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| within each of the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| and making sure that, you know, all those are compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| I mean, you'll look at industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| and see that, you know, residential's not really in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| except for the industrial mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| which could allow for multifamily, but that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| You're moving into an area that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| is kind of grittier, as it were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| So, yeah, I mean, really, you can look at the mixes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| I mean, I don't think any of the mixed-use districts we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| speak to incompatibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| but people's sensitivities are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| And I think everyone should be taking a close look at those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| Okay. And then a couple suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| When you do issue the second draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| I think it would be much easier for everyone to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| if you can address the changes that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| from first draft to second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| so that, you know, you don't have to go flip back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| to the first draft and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| okay, this is what this said, and now it says this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| so we can see something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| So just as a practical consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| when we're reviewing it and then everyone in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| is reviewing it as well, I think that would really be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| Yeah, when we sat down with staff yesterday and talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| we already knew we're issuing a red-line draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| that will show the changes, so that's already in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| That would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| And then, you know, I know we paid a lot of attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| to the accessory dwelling units this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| and I think that's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| One recommendation I would have with dealing with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| is to look at what we've done in the commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| where we have, you know, different subsections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| And so what I might recommend doing going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| in the second draft is having subzones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| in the residential as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| addressing where it's appropriate to have those units and not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| And so the suggestion I would have would be to have an RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| which there's no accessory dwelling units available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| an RN1A, where accessory dwelling units are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| and an R1E, where there's no duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| and no accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| And those are pretty consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| with a lot of the residential zones we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Keep in mind that there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| the predominant residential zone is R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| We don't have a lot of folks in those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| asking to get it changed to R1A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| so they can have accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| So I think just making that sudden change to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| which we've already addressed a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| would be maybe not wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| So having some sections where it is allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| where it's not allowed, I think would be a better approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Councilwoman Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| I just have a question and a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| And the question is more for clarification and confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| So mixed use is allowed in all of the commercial zones in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| And in the industrial mixed use zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Just wanted to make sure I was correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| And then I said this earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| because I was in the Stakeholder Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| but I'm going to say it every chance I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| I just want to make sure that as we're adding design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| around landscaping and architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| that as a council and as a city and as MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| we're making sure that we have the right expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| and the right resources to provide support to landowners and developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| and to, you know, enforce those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| And I know Mr. Ahrens, he's heard me say it a couple times today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| So he already knows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| But I can't pass up the opportunity to just make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| that that is on everybody's radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| that there are additional design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| and landscape design standards in this, which I support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| I think that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| But I also know that those require extra work for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| You know, there are extra resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| And we'll hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| I have no doubt that we're going to hear that from property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| But as a city, we also need to be prepared to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| that we have the resources to put teeth behind what we're codifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4546)|
| 1:15:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Are there any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| Are you all at the end of your 15 minutes now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| I have one last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| It's two, but it's the same topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| While we want to try to eliminate them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| that's kind of the purpose of how we structured out the zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| we wanted to be clear on those that remain what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| So you have now separate provisions for nonconforming structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| nonconforming uses, and nonconforming lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| and what you can and can't do with each of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| rather than one kind of general category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| They're very specific on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| A couple of key policy changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| The first was we took a less aggressive approach to nonconforming uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| So essentially, if the structure that that nonconforming use is located in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| is damaged or destroyed, they have up to a year to get a building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| and the use can be reestablished when that structure is conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| because then if the structure is also nonconforming, different rules kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| Currently, it says regardless of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| whether it's conforming or nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| if it's destroyed by 50% or more, the use has to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| And we wanted to be a little bit more lenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| We also looked at things like the existing single-wide manufactured homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| and allowances for being able to replace those in kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| with another single-wide manufactured home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| If at any point that's then replaced with a multi-sectional, that permission goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| But the idea was to allow people to replace their current single-wides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| as they get more dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| The fear of not being able to replace it could potentially lead these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| to continue to stay and stay in a blighted condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| without a fear of losing the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| And then finally, the last one is some permissions for nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| single-family and two-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| And it's really the idea of if I'm an existing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| since you have to be existing, and I'm nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| because I'm too much into my side yard or I'm too much into my rear yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| and I want to either make an addition vertically, pop the top at a second floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| or if I want to push back further, say, into my rear yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| lengthen my home with an addition, say a mudroom or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| that you would be able to do it without going through a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| because you're just continuing the plane of that wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| You're not going to be pushing back, which makes for very odd-looking buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| and also causes, you know, it's a more expensive form of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| This allows you to maintain your current housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| gives people an easy way to do improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| As you know, everybody says the greenest house that's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| is the one that's already built, so it's the idea of being allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| to make improvements in an easier fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| And with that, that is the last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| That's your 15 minutes. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Are there other questions of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| If not, we are now into the public comment section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| and we only have one person signed up to speak, and that's Mr. Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| So, Mr. Hill, if you'd like to come forward and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| I'll hold my comments until a later meeting, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| Okay, council, we're finished with the workshop here on the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| But remember, tomorrow, 8 o'clock breakfast, 830, we start our day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| It will be a fairly long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| We will break for lunch, but we're going to have lunch in the office upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| so we'll at least get away from this room for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| So coffee, tea, et cetera, at 8 o'clock, light lunch at noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| and we'll be done by 6 or 8 tomorrow night, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| It's up to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| But thank you all, and thank the audience for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Thank you very much, and we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR265180516?start=4782)|
