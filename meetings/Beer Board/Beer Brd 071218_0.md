| 0:02:01| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| All absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| We're waiting on a copy of the corporate charter and approval from the Fire Inspector Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| and final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| I just had a couple of questions and then I'm prepared to make a motion depending on the response there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| When do you expect to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=145)|
| 0:02:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| The restaurant is open right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| We're just waiting for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| Well, but you are the new owners, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| So the beer permit that was with the previous owners is no longer valid, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| So you cannot serve beer at this point, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| Ms. Martin, Ms. Dade, would you all like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| I understand that the previous are still current owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| If this is complete, then these folks can take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| So until the corporate charter is prepared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Until I have these documents, they're not going to complete their transaction is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| The parties can time that themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| I do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| And I did know they were open, and that was the reason for my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| I wasn't sure who was operating the restaurant at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| So the previous owners are still operating the restaurant, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Well, then I move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Counselman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Yeah, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| It seems like we're missing an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| Was that in one of these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| It is in here, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| Is that an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| It's old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| Blue Elephant Thai Cuisine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=265)|
| 0:04:38| I'll move to move to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Knoxville Food and Drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| I mean, we're in Westman Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| I'm Don Howell, attorney with Francis Collins Seymour 550 Main Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| here on behalf of the applicant along with representatives of the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| We're waiting on a final approval from the building inspector, fire inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| Well, I've had some conversation this week with the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| I think two of the owners of the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| and perhaps it would be a good idea if you all would identify yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| and give your names and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| I'm Keith Blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| My address is 174 Windy Drive in Ringgold, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| And you are one of the owners, Keith, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| I'm a shareholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| Mike Segoza, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1005 Pennery Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Mr. Goza is one of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| I'm Mr. Goza's attorney from Chattanooga, Doug Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Thank you, Mr. Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I just wanted to indicate that I have had conversation with him this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| and there was a great deal of concern because they have not received all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| documentation that they are aware needs to be in place for us to consider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| permit tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| However, the timing is such that it's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| and perhaps you would like to speak to that for us, Mr. Howell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Here's the situation where everything is sort of coming together here right at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| and going into the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| The situation is they have Friday scheduled, as we understand it, the final inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| Based upon the inspections that some of the reports that we have gotten through the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| we don't anticipate that there will be any outstanding issues after the inspections on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=405)|
| 0:06:54| Then we have to get that certificate of occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| and a couple of items that are in a letter from the Alcoholic Beverage Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| that it's in everyone's packet for them to go ahead and complete issuance of their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=420)|
| 0:07:08| So we're really at a sequence and a timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| and we would ask that the Board consider going ahead and approving subject to completion of the final inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| and issuance then of the permit from the Alcoholic Beverage Commission because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| we don't anticipate any significant issue with any of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| but it's just a matter of timing to get that done here because without that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| we anticipate that those things will fall into place within the next, you know, very short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| And so we would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| I believe what I was told was that the ABC will not issue the certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| without your certificate of occupancy being in their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| And, unfortunately, some problems arose, I think, last week or the week before regarding some plumbing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| And when that occurred, then the final inspection had to be delayed and could not occur until this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| Now, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| And so then, as you said, that has to be forwarded to Nashville for the issuance of the ABC license, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| And there are two other housekeeping items that are set out in the letter that's in the packet from Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| from the Alcoholic Beverage Commission office here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| And I think the issue is the fact that this is our last council meeting prior to your anticipated opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=511)|
| 0:08:40| which is, is it New Year's Eve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| They're hoping to be able to do that and anticipate that these contingencies will be removed by that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| Otherwise, without having the opportunity to do that, then we're over in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| I think the concern and the reason they called me was because that could not be accomplished because of the inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| until after this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| And I think the question was, if you all recall, we had delayed this, postponed this a couple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| and primarily there was a question about the measurements and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| And so the ABC license is crucial to their operating within the parameters that our ordinance calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| So they were asking me about the possibility of a special council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| And that was something, of course, I couldn't make a judgment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| But, you know, we could possibly have a special council meeting the day after Christmas or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| provided they get everything in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| But, you know, we also have the possibility of approving it pending the final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| reaching the inspections office here and the ABC office being able to deliver their certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| So that's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| And I thought I would explain my role in it because I just encourage them to come on this evening rather than putting it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| And obviously nothing would happen out there until these other things fall into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| So that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| They spent about a million dollars out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| And this sounds like a lot of money to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| But I guess maybe I just felt that if there was a possibility of this being worked out in this manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| I would encourage them to take this opportunity to see if they could get it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=621)|
| 0:10:29| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Ms. Pillow, are we confident about the measurements for this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| And the reason why I ask is because the blue elephant is not listed as having a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| And I was under the understanding that the blue elephant was up where Corky's had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| and that this was on the lower level at the rear, which would seem to be further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| So that confused me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| You're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| And I have a little issue personally with the way those measurements are calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| But the manner in which I understand and those measurements are calculated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| I think, Mr. Swanson, to the center of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| Property line to property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| But the problem is here that there is absolutely no access to the lower level from the frontage property line on Kingston High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=674)|
| 0:11:23| Now, the blue elephant has their IBC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| So as did Corky's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| But on the apartment application, the blue elephant isn't even shown as being deficient, which was very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| I think it's very unusual, but I think the prior issuance of the permit to Corky's probably is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| And this location did not have a prior permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| It has a long history because it was the Rathskeller for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| And at that point in time, there was access from the Kingston Pike frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| And there was a cut through where now there is a storefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| And it completely eliminates any access from the upper level or the Kingston Pike side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| So their access is from around back underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Also, the Matrix operated down there for a period of time until 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| And I think in the meantime, another restaurant operated down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| But I think also they had IBC license and probably that's how, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| But I think it's a very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Mr. Swanson, I just kept talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Instead of giving you a chance, maybe you had something you needed to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| No, it gave me time to actually look up the law so I'd know what I was talking about for a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| Section 4-66 of the code provides that measurements are from building line to building line by the shortest distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| Well, a funny thing was when I inquired about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| they told me it was from the midline of that roof, which would have been the back end of their property, which is. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| Maybe they ought to look at the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| You know, what would I know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| At any rate, that's the situation and that's why we postponed that previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=780)|
| 0:13:08| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| No, I guess I did not make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| I move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Just so the record will be clear, does that final documentation include an ABC permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| The final documentation, in my mind, must include an ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| That's included in your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| That is included in my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Because that documentation is required for it to meet our policy and our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=824)|

| 0:13:57| Mayor Hattons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| I won't issue the certificate until they have received the CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=840)|
| 0:14:10| Move to move them to the end of the agenda behind Blue Elephant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| Would you put them over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| We have a motion and a second to move them to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=872)|

| 0:14:39| The Pine House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=879)|
| 0:14:51| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| My name is Toho, 815.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| We're waiting on final approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| Health Department, and Task Program Certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Is this the T. Ho location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Where are you at with TASC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| I completed the program last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| Mr. Husky, does that ring true with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| I would have to defer to Wanda on that one and see if she has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| If he has a certificate, we just need to get it in the file, but we haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| I'm going to go ahead and move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=948)|
| 0:15:57| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=966)|
| 0:16:17| Marina's Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=977)|
| 0:16:27| Could you give us your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| My name is James Cobb, and I reside at 211 Connick Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Oh, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| We're waiting on final approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Health Department, and Task Program Certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| Hi, Mr. Cobb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| And you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| I know Mr. Cobb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| You mentioned about the task program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| When you and I spoke over the phone, you told me you thought you had done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| Have you gone to do the task program certification yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| When did you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| That was last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Did they give you a certificate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Yes, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Do you have it with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| You need to bring that in for them to have in the record because that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| And as we talked over the phone, that's a really important issue as it relates to this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| Also, you and I had talked about the footage requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| You called me this afternoon and wasn't sure if they had done the measurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| We have a document in our folder here that shows that Edgewood, Chapel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| and Bethel are within 300 feet of this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| You and I kind of talked about that being possibly true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| and about the prospects of maybe postponing this to take a look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| And I may ask for that, but we do have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| You need to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Just for the beer board, some historical information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Mr. Cobb actually operated a business in this facility several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| maybe eight, nine, ten years ago, and had a beer permit at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| And the reason he was able to get one is there is, and I think it is still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| a viable piece of legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| an exception to the 300-foot rule for certain sections in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| and this particular part of town is one of those sections that has that exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| What I would like to do is possibly, Mr. Cobb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| postpone this to allow you to get your task information in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| and also for Mr. Swanson to get the council members so that they can review that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| There are several parts of town that there was a historic ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| that has an exception to this particular rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| because there was called up its particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| and what they were trying to do with economic development in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| And I think that's how you got the beer permit before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| And I've read that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| I think it is still in effect several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I think I looked at it in another situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| So, you know, if it doesn't cause you too much grief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| what I'd like to do is postpone it so that you can get your task information in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| because it's very important to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| And then for us to actually let council take a look at this legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| that allows the exception to the 300-foot rule in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| I'm sure each council member may want to read it, talk to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| I don't want to press anybody to make a decision today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| but let each council member read it, become aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| because I spoke to you and told you when that occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| that was a whole different council at that time and a whole different beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| So we need to make sure everybody's kind of brought up to speed about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| and take a look at it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| And he had requested that I do that, and I want to make sure everyone's made aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Is your motion to put it to the next beer board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| Yes, unless we have a special called beer board meeting in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| And if we do, I'd like to have it put on that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| But to the next beer board meeting would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| That would be January the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Is that okay with you, Mr. Cobb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| And I'm trying to see what we can do to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| I know this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| He does a lot of work in neighborhoods and with houses and homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| and helps folk out and elderly folk and does some repair work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| He's actually done a little repair work at my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| So if there's a way to try to work with him and help him out, I want to see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| But I want council to have read the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| and be very comfortable with it when we come to that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1239)|
| 0:20:49| Blue Elephant Thai Cuisine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| Can I just comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| I had a conversation this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| I was curious about Ms. Roddy's already questioned the location and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| And I was aware of the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| The owner of that shopping center and that development and I were in conversation this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1269)|
| 0:21:17| And I pointed out the fact that he had this establishment had many hurdles to getting their bill permit documentation completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1277)|
| 0:21:31| And from the conversation we had, it appears that they do not intend to open within the next couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1291)|
| 0:21:41| So I had just said, do you think a postponement would be a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| Now, whether he has been in conversation with him, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| But I believe it would be wise for us to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| So I would move based on what the owner of the property, which is being renovated, said to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| I would move that we postpone this to the January beer board meeting, the regularly scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| But I do think we probably need, along with that motion, to be sure and notify them that it's been postponed to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Manhattans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1349)|
| 0:22:41| Ms. Pilow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| I would make a motion to move it to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| I think we may be very close at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| But at the back of the things that we've already said at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| So I'll make a motion that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| What was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| To move it to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| After the administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Don't you have another item here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| If you all approved at your September 25th meeting, the Knoxville Cigar Company, subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| their 90 days is expiring and they still need some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| And I believe the applicant is here to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| Could you give us your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Sherry Ziering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| And I think the only thing that we're waiting on, we got a little tied up with some of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| So we actually just need the fire marshal to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| And I think he's going to count the tables, is all, count the seats, to get our final occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1434)|
| 0:24:06| And we anticipate having that completed with the tables and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| As a matter of fact, my husband is on his way back from North Carolina with the tables as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1451)|
| 0:24:19| I anticipate having all those in place by no later than Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| And I was going to go ahead and call the fire inspector and get that scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| He said he was pretty flexible about being able to come out to do that because it wouldn't take very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1473)|
| 0:24:41| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| I'll move we extend the deadline by 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Let's have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1494)|
| 0:25:09| Now is the time on our agenda for administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Senor Taco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1514)|
| 0:25:25| My name is Roberto Ruiz, 8300 West Pepper Court, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| You're here tonight because you've had two underage sales and to present us with a plan of how you intend to prevent this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1533)|
| 0:25:42| We've been working very hard on making the steps to eliminate this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| I have a little package, if you don't mind if we can pass it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| First of all, we take all the new waiters and waitresses to training for a couple weeks before they start serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| At the meantime, they have to go through the OS program or the tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| Then we post some signs on the time clock that they're not serving minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1567)|
| 0:26:15| At the meantime, we have a little check sheet where they have 10 steps where they swear anywhere from provide a good service to our guest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1575)|
| 0:26:28| or ask for ID to not to serve intoxicated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| If necessary, call a cab or even call the police if necessary, but to excuse this thing to the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1594)|
| 0:26:44| They sign five minutes before the shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| Then at that point in time, we make them set up the dates in these calendars so they know that they have to ask when the dates are appropriate for their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1609)|
| 0:27:01| Then at that particular time, we make them order these buttons from Budweiser, WeID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| Then we give them the order of padtechers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| When they take the order from the customers, they have to ask for the date of birth and write it down with the driver's license number and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1630)|
| 0:27:19| We have got involved with the management and bartenders to reinforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| And if they don't comply with it, we terminate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| And the last ones, but not least, we have posted these signs all over the dining room that you have it on your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| And last, we have stickers on our menus that we will ask for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| And if they don't provide it, then we have to remove them out of the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| And you can pass it around if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| So we're doing everything to eliminate this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| We're trying to provide zero defects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| So I just ask the board to give us an opportunity to keep working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| And I apologize for the mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Yeah, Mr. Ruiz, I'm impressed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| That's a nice idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| We have in our packet, we have the plan you submitted, I guess, last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| We also have one from May 19, 2006, which was after your first violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Now, I'm wondering on the remedial plan there, you have this wonderful line that managers have to verify and recheck IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1704)|
| 0:28:33| And you actually have a line that says there are at least five times before a drink is served that the server should be noting the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| Now, I'm wondering if that was a policy on May 19, 2006, what happened back in, I guess, it's March of this year when you had your second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1719)|
| 0:28:51| What broke down in the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| There was a lot of change in management at that time, and unfortunately, you know, they slipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| And, you know, we're dealing with humans, and I can apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| Now, it says in this that the police report actually says that the card, the ID was taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| Was this a matter of somebody didn't write it down right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Do you know what specifically happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| She didn't write it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| She saw that it was the same month, and it was like eight days before the birthday, and she thought it was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| And she recognized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| It was a math problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1774)|

| 0:29:49| I'm president of Kick Shots Sports Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| Yes, you're here because you've had two underage sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| and present us with a plan of what you intend to do to prevent this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| Yes, I'd stop by and drop a plan on Thursday you should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| After the first incident, we had went to an armband situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| to where people who was over the age of 21 would be presented with an armband when they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| and obviously that had failed because we got a second incident on May 11, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| After that, we went to a policy of no one under 21, and we checked IDs at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| I have a door person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| And we just simply do not allow anyone under the age of 21 to enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| And then, of course, in October, with the law changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| we decided to be a smoking establishment and cannot allow anyone under the age of 21 to enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1837)|
| 0:30:48| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Y'all have a Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Buffalo Wild Wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1858)|
| 0:31:08| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| My name is Chris Rabeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| I am Buffalo Wild Wings' attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| My address is at Bone McAllister Norton in Nashville, 511 Union, Suite 1600-37219.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| We've got Tim Vickers, who is this location's general manager, and Hal Osborne, who is the regional manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| We submitted a revised remedial plan last week, and I believe you all should have copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1886)|
| 0:31:35| The plan obviously focuses on the changes that have been made since the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| and the first remedial plan that was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Happy to talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| I think most importantly, consistent with company policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| the server who made the sale in this particular instance was terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Second, Buffalo Wild Wings is the only store that I'm aware of in the state that has a card reading device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1916)|
| 0:32:09| It's sort of a test program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| The store had the cards, excuse me, the scanners prior to this sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| They were still sort of working with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| figuring out whether requiring their use with each and every sale was feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1940)|
| 0:32:28| Since this sale, they have determined that it is and ought to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| I think those are probably the two most important things to highlight in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Certainly, I know that the board probably doesn't want to hear just from the lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| and they want to hear from the folks here and there day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| So Tim and Hal will be happy to field any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| or speak about any of the policies and procedures that are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| and that the board has questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| There are going to be some changes that are made in the corporate oversight connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| with this particular restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| There's going to be a, I believe Hal is responsible for stores in North Carolina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| and this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| I believe they're considering moving him to Tennessee so that he's closer to the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| They're going to hire a new sort of operations manager above Hal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=1996)|
| 0:33:24| who will help with that oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| Consistent with the store policies, certainly everyone is trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| and the training programs that are required by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| required by the city of Knoxville, are all in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| And I guess the other worthwhile point to add here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| is something that the store does on a routine basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| They require each and every server, each and every bartender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| to sign a sheet of paper beginning every shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| that they acknowledge the company policies, company rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| regarding the service of alcohol, regarding state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| and their understanding that they will be terminated if they violate that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| The store has actually gotten some, notwithstanding this sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| the store has actually gotten, I think, some news story coverage here locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| where they've passed other sort of informal stings done by some local news stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| I think focused on high schoolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| And I'd like to point to the board's attention, I think, similarly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| This is not a case, I think, where there's a lack of a system in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| I think the policies are strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| We have a human who asked for an ID but either misread the birth date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| or did math incorrectly, and that's the result of the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| Tell me a little more about the scanners you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| What do they read, and how effective are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Do you have an electrical outlet you can actually test your own ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| I have an ID here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| Under your desk, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Look under the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| The scanner takes approximately 30, 45 seconds, maybe a minute or two, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| depending on whether or not it wants to act up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| You insert the ID, and it spits out the birth, the age of the person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| and I believe the expiration date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| So that there is theoretically no math involved on behalf of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| How long have you had the scanner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Because if these are miscalculations, as you commented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| was the scanner in place when those miscalculations were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| They did have the scanners at the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| They just weren't using them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| They were required to be using them, but the server did not use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| Had she been caught not using it, she would have been terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| But, you know, in this particular instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| the police officer caught her before the restaurant staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| or excuse me, the management did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| The revised plan indicates it is now official policy that the scanners are to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2189)|
| 0:36:38| The distinction here is that probably, as with most restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| that we have a company policy notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| It's going to be included in this store's policy notebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| that the scanner is to be used, period, paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| Because not every store has this scanner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| it's not typically included in the company notebook that's passed out to every new employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| We're going to make that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| and ensure that they all know that it's a terminable offense to not use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| How expensive is this machine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| I think Hal can probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| The particular machine you're looking at there is around $500 per machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| Since we purchased this machine, they do make a new machine, which is smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| It can actually be carried in the server's pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| I believe it's $399.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| Do you utilize this when the client comes in the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| or do you use it when the request for a serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| Depending on business, if it's an extremely busy night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| we've made our establishment where there's only one way in and one way out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| and that way we can as well ID the guests when they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| We currently have one in our bar as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| and not only are we leaving the responsibility to a door guy or a manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| the person serving as well has to physically take the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| The situation in the incident when we got caught, the girl removed the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| but disregarded scanning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| So we got her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| She was terminated for violating the policy of not only serving someone under age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| but she also didn't do as expected and as what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2298)|
| 0:38:26| She ignored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Exactly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| Actually, this was a wing certified trainer, and she was a long-term employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| a 22-year-old young female, and since she's no longer with the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2314)|
| 0:38:43| We had a pre-meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| This was in a situation where we were extremely busy on this night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| We were really slow, and she took the ID and misread it and didn't use the scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| Most of the time with the scanners, there's still going to be human error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| but if they make sure that that's the person on the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| the machine itself is going to tell the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| If it's expired, it says do not take ID expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| So we have that side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| And that's the important part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| The server, the bartender, still has to be involved in IDing the customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| primarily because you've got to make sure that the ID they're handing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| is who handed you the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| But to the extent that it limits, in fact, I guess assuming it's used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| and assuming it's working properly, it takes almost to zero the chance of. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| And, again, the distinction here, I think these were mentioned in the prior plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| but the distinction here is that it's becoming part of the official memorialized policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| This is, I don't know of any other Buffalo Wild Wings in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| There may be others that are trying it out that have these machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| Obviously, they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| They are expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| They also require some finagling in terms of the store's operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| If it is a busy night, it takes the server a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| You're going to have to make an extra trip up to the bar, to the cash register, but so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| Councilman Peralz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Don't let my lack of hair fool you about my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| But, actually, you know, my driver's license, I don't have the barcode on the back of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| So, obviously, it's not uniform inside Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| Is this putting barcodes on the back uniform because, you know, you're at the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| which is going to have students from all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Do other states barcode their driver's licenses now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| The only state so far that we've had trouble with was North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| And with those IDs, when it's an out-of-state ID or an ID that doesn't have a scan code on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| the server actually has to get the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| So, that way, it's up to not only just one person, but we have two people double checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| And if it's an out-of-state ID, then we can use our out-of-state ID verification book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| and make sure that that's a just ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Counselor McBecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| It also says it spots fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| Mine, I'm actually glad we ran mine because the back of mine is coming off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| which I've actually had people tell me that a good person will look at this and question it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| because the back is so bad, but this machine didn't do anything on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| Is that because it had a valid barcode and it didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| It is because the barcode was still scannable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| If it's like rough, if somebody has laminated something, this will spot it, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| We had a situation where a valid Tennessee ID was actually the whole back of the ID was removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| and put on a different ID, and it didn't verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| When we stuck it through there, it pulled up different information that was on the front of the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| The barcode is still going to show the actual person's date of birth, so the front did not match that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| And you had that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| But the machine didn't say this is an altered ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| It just read the barcode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| It just read the barcode when the ID was fake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| But when it's a fake ID with a fake barcode, it says this is a fake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| And the idea here is that this is a tool for the server to replace it, obviously, because there are situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| My ID, for example, is blurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| It was off kilter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| I haven't run my ID through this, and I don't know whether it would work or not, but a good server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| and, in fact, I often run into that where they inspect the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| Can you speak into the mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| I was mentioning that, clearly, this is not a replacement for servers looking carefully at IDs and checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2564)|
| 0:42:53| But, again, it's a useful tool, certainly, and can help eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| Scarcity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| I wanted to ask Officer Husky, does this mean, to my mind and, I think, to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| we've kind of got wide eyes about this machine, and it looks kind of exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Is your sense that this is a good idea, or does any part of this worry you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| It is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| There's a couple other clubs that are starting to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| But as soon as you come up with machines, they find a way to stick a different type of barcode on there that will scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| But it is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| That's a great business to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| Lease them like they do the credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| The MACs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Amy J. Maxwell, 8605 Old Carriage Court, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| You're here because you've had two underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| And to present us with a plan of how you intend on preventing that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| First of all, I want to take responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| My staff has always depended on me and one in my management that's been with me for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| We have basically verified the IDs, 21 up at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| And my other two venues prior to this one was predominantly nightclub and night business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| So, these situations occurred when my manager, Barry Monnet, and myself had stepped away from these doors for minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| So, you know, I take responsibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| But what we've done is we used to, prior to these citations, we were open during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| open to a more family environment, restaurant environment, try to get the business there during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| It didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Overhead pretty much ate us up and lack of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| Prior to the October 1st, we started opening then around 4 o'clock for happy hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| still open to allow families to come in and then at 9 o'clock going to an age-restricted 21 and up environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| Both of these citations occurred prior to, you know, prior to 10, I think around 9 or 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| Since the October 1 smoking laws were passed, we are 21 and up from open to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| Myself or a manager is at the door all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| No relief for a server or somebody else to look over the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| One of three of us are at the door from open to close, 21 and up, verified by one of our three eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| We also have a scanner device similar to that that I bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| It's a little bit bigger, but it's a desktop, and it does read fake IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| but we also have to visually verify that too because if we weren't looking at the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| I could hand Mr. Steve Hall's ID as I was walking in, and if that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| one of us didn't look to verify that the picture was not the person, then that system would not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| But we also do armbands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| After we ID them, we put an armband on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Then when they go to the bar, if that armband is not on them, then that staff asks for an ID again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2770)|
| 0:46:18| then sends them back to the front door because then that becomes a situation where we're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| okay, what did you do with your armband?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Why did you take your armband off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| And we ask them to leave for the night because they didn't follow policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| I'm a little ‑‑ what we have here is you had an underage sale on 5-11 and then again on 8-31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2801)|
| 0:46:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Which is not a very good record to say that in eight months' time you've succeeded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| and you only opened pretty recently, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| We opened at the beginning of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| So you've been open eight months, and you've succeeded in two violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| Haven't had any since then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| And to reiterate, I've had three venues in seven years, and this is the only two that ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| And Barbara can tell you, I mean, Wanda can tell you, I had a venue here for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| and had another venue in Blount County for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| And when did you get the scanners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| How long ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| About right at the October 1 because they are coming out with fake IDs just to be able to go into venues that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| you know, not only 21 because now the smoking in a lot of the venues in Knoxville did go 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| So the fluctuation of fake IDs is fluid right now with the college kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Well, I'm real concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| You know, for all these folks that have been here tonight, I've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| carefully looked over when these violations have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| And, you know, one location has had three violations, but they're, you know, about literally one year apart in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| These are a little too close, in my opinion, and I'll respectfully move to send this to a suspension of vacation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2885)|
| 0:48:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| I just noticed something here that I may have seen before and forgotten it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| but we've got down here with the 51107 that it was a dismissal by agreement of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| Can somebody explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Does anybody know what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| Because I would imagine we're one of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Is that to say that somewhere in that situation that maybe something was wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| Can I explain what happened on 511?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Maybe I'll explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| What happened was, and I had just came into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| It was early, right in the happy hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| A bartender was behind the bar, and she was very busy, and a barback that also has her ABC card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| One of my bartenders had called and was having some card problems, had a wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| The barback jumped behind the bar and asked to help Jenna, whichever way you can, give me five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| because I have also bartended since college for 18 years, half of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| When I came back out, this had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| What had happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| I came out to the cadets and undercover being, citing them, and I asked what had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| Jenna had taken the order of this undercover cadet and had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| Can I ask you what you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| He said, A Bud Light bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| She said, Give me one minute, and I'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| She stepped away to the computer to put in some food orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| At that point in time, Grant, the barback that I had asked to jump behind the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| and help her just for a brief moment before I could get back up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| was walking through saying, Has everybody got anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Everybody need anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| And the undercover cadet said, She's already taken my order, but you can get my Bud Light for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| At that point in time, Grant assumed, and we all know what assumed means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| but he assumed that since she had taken his order, that she had ID'd him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| So it was a human, it was kind of a gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| No, I would disagree a little bit with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| But we, I guess my agreement on the part is we somehow agreed to drop this with it, bottom line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| That's something that the DA worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| The DA did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Do we object to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| The person that actually got cited was not supposed to be serving alcohol, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| He was working in the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| That's what Ms. Maxwell told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Yeah, he barbequed into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| He took it upon himself to get the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| So this was cited over to General Sessions' court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Do we have to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| We're getting ready to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| So you've been, the board is recommending that you go to a suspension revocation hearing and they will notify you when that is scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3089)|
| 0:51:39| I need to be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| I stepped out for the moment, so I'm going to be a no on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| If everybody says yes, I'm a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| Well, I was an abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| She was an abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3111)|
| 0:52:00| I think everybody else was a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Yeah, I think everybody else was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| I didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| She'll be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| I guess I'll call Manhattan again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| Manhattan's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3133)|
| 0:52:24| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| What was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| This is an applicant that's not eligible because of a sale to underage within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Ms. Brunson with the Metropolitan Drug Commission has asked to be able to speak to us for a few moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| And I told her that would be fine if there was no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| We didn't have a workshop on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| Actually, that's part of the question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| Really just wanted to get a little feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| We did this in County Commission yesterday, asking about the Tennessee Responsible Vendor Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| kind of your insights as to whether perhaps there needs to be any changes with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| whether you've had any issues or problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I know I've spoken with Officer Husky a little bit, but wanted to get a little feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| And then two, since we're short on time, I will pass along the request from County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| which you will be getting formally, wanting to have us sit down with beer boards from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| from the county, as well as the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| to look at a little more uniformity amongst the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Donnie, did you want to offer any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| Real briefly, there currently are no responsible vendors in East Tennessee, so I can't really give you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| I haven't had to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| You have to be careful how you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| I'm serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| I do have some questions with some of the stuff, and that I think we'll take up at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| Well, and we've had some policy lunches in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| If that might be a proper venue, if we would host another one amongst those bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| that we could put this on as an agenda item at that time as well, if that would be agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3259)|
| 0:54:29| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| I serve on the board of the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| and, of course, all of you all remember that this law was new as of July 1 this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| and is scheduled to expire on June 30 unless it's renewed during session this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| So the board is looking for some guidance as to whether or not some lobbying should take place surrounding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| And when Ms. Brunson and I talked about it, and I think maybe Officer Husky is saying somewhat the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| it's almost like we don't have enough of a track record with this yet to really have a feel as to how it's going to affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| As you all recall, if a business certifies as a responsible vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| then it kind of removes them from our normal suspension revocation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| and that was a concern we had initially, but it doesn't look like we've really encountered it yet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3312)|
| 0:55:21| Councilwoman Friedla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Well, I would just comment that for my own benefit, the luncheon that we had previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3322)|
| 0:55:30| where we went and discussed some issues with you, and you assisted us in some interpretations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| I thought it was extremely helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| And I think that's a good time and a good way in which to approach this without having a full-blown workshop necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3338)|
| 0:55:47| So, you know, if you wanted to plan something of that sort, I would personally like to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| and would feel it would be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| And I think the feeling yesterday was that we'll be contacting the law department within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| and trying to get a little bit of a bulleted list of what the discrepancies are between the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| and the county ordinance as well as trying to get a hold of the ones from the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| So when we've got that kind of together, we'll contact the corresponding offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| and see if you can come up with a date that's agreeable to most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| Well, you know, I would just comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| That would be really helpful to me because a lot of my district that I serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| stretches out into Farragut and through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| And I am often asked questions, which I simply am not prepared to respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| because I don't have the information about how they differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| And that would be very helpful to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| Well, and I think this particular request came from Weigels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| where they had a manager that was overseeing a store in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| and then one that had county rules and then had city rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| and there were some hours of operation questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| And it's perfectly understandable how anyone could get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| I think some of the grocery stores also experience those variances, variations, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3424)|
| 0:57:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Merry Christmas to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Is there any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| Yes, I just wanted to make a comment for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| that I appreciate Officer Husky and how he is getting us information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| I love getting this information in e-mails and looking down at the STINGS and the updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| and also the information that you gathered for us from the other city about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| the applicant that was up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| And I really appreciate your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| And I was reading through one of your e-mails about your last STING operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| I thought how convenient not to have paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| I can just scroll down and look at that very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| And I thank you for implementing those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| We have a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071218?start=3480)|
