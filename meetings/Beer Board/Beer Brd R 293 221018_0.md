| 0:01:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| Today's agenda includes seven beer permit applications, five addendum items, two administrative hearings, a resolution, and a partridge in a pear tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=87)|
| 0:01:37| Sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=97)|

| 0:02:00| And all those whose permits are approved this afternoon can pick up their permit at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| Let's get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| First up, we have Appalachian Mountain Bike Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=130)|
| 0:02:21| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Matthew Kellogg with the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club, 6110 Burnett Creek Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| I think this is for an event coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Do you want to tell us a little bit about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| This is our 13th annual fall festival that we host at Baker Creek Preserve, which is the gateway to Knoxville's urban wilderness, over 50 miles of natural surface trails that we're lucky to have here in our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=154)|
| 0:02:46| So this event will essentially raise essentially a quarter of our funds for the year that we put back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| So we look forward to having about 2,500 of our closest friends from as far away as Washington State, actually, this festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=174)|
| 0:03:03| So come and join us on November the 4th, 5th, and 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=183)|

| 0:11:46| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=706)|

| 0:11:48| Sir, can you share your name as well for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| My name is M.S. Kumar Mande.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Given two years, I mean, I'll let my colleagues weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| Normally we would at least request another background check since it has been so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| We've done already the last time or before last time background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| But if need be, do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=736)|

| 0:12:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| I think maybe that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| Did they come in and do fingerprints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| Do we have any way of knowing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| I actually don't get the record of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| I do feel like that was requested by the board before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Sergeant Coward, how would we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Where does that go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| I do not have their file in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| I would have to check that in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Mr. Santabarbara, I may have pronounced that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Is that your last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Mande.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| There's two names on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| I read the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| Mr. Mande, did you go down and do the voluntary background check again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| where you do like fingerprinting and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Because that was the last time we approved it, I guess, in June of 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| Yeah, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Have you been paying rent on the lease for the property, or do you own the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| My cousin owns it, and we pay the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| So you haven't had to pay rent the entire time you're waiting for the bills out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| When we start the business, we start the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| We don't pay rent right now, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| So you don't pay rent until it's open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| That can deal with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=823)|

| 0:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| So you still need building inspections, fire prevention, and health department approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| and these will all happen after your electrician is done with the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| Yeah, electrician done, and after that we have the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| And can you just remind us again, because it's been two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| what exactly your business will entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| This was a former laundromat, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| Used to be the laundromat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| We opened the convenience store grocery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| What all will you be selling there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| What's the format?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=855)|

| 0:14:24| What kind of groceries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Are you just selling things out of the coolers, or do you have food items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| Just the food item on the shelf, not the mostly the, some like the, not the cooler one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=870)|

| 0:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| But not fresh items, produce, any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| It's just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=888)|

| 0:14:53| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| I hope that you guys can get us, and we'll check on the background check from June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=902)|

| 0:15:08| Yes, I'll make a motion to extend for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| How long do you think it's going to take this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| It's 30 to 40 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Let's do 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| If you don't think you're going to meet the 60-day mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| can we maybe talk before it comes to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| I think the thing is I'm trying to avoid you having to pay for a new beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| and we don't typically extend this long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| but I know it's been an awkward time with COVID in the mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| and that's when you got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=943)|

| 0:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Do you want to share an update with where you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| I think everything is done except the last inspection, if I'm not wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| That's the only one thing that's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Everything else is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| So what do you feel like your timeline will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| It would be like 30 to 60 maybe, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| It should be done before 30 days, but it's good to be safe side if I have extra days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| if they are running behind or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1007)|

| 0:16:54| It's just approval from the inspections department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| I think they've had a final building permit issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| but the beer inspection hasn't been conducted yet, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| I'll move to extend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1027)|

| 0:17:35| How are you all doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| I'm Chris O'Rourke, 5000 Clinton Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| 37919 maybe, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| I'm not sure of the zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| She's looking for an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| I'm here on behalf of Tiffany Scarborough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| She's looking for an extension of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Where she's at right now is that she's waiting for a concrete floor finisher to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| and we're on back order for a lot of equipment that we need for back bar supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1079)|
| 0:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| You think 60 days will be enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| I'm hoping so for her sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| That's what she required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| I believe in time myself, November the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| I'm opening two bars in Missouri, so I won't be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| I'm sorry, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| You can go ahead and make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Yes, I would like to make a motion to extend 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Mr. Burr, can you confirm if there's anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| It's just those three inspections, approvals, inspections, fire, and health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| I just have a question of a similar ilk that I asked someone earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| It's irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| It's more of a personal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| You're welcome to talk to me outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| I'm just curious, you guys are behind because you're waiting on shipping of back ordered things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Starting a business venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| I'm curious, have you guys had to pay rent while you're waiting for all of these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| It was in the contract agreement that when she took the building over, I had a different company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| that rent wouldn't kick in until the day the company actually opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| It's more of a curiosity thing of the general state of affairs because it concerns me when people get behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| as they start their business because they're waiting on supplies that are outside of all of our control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| and outside of your control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Which is a good thing because the lease on that one location is $13,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| You guys are going to sell a lot of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Well, that's the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| That's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| We're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Did I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1206)|

| 0:20:27| I've just been waiting on the final approvals from the city with the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| but I have everything all ready to set to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| I'm requesting a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Is that enough time, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1244)|

| 0:20:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1246)|

| 0:20:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1250)|

| 0:20:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1254)|

| 0:20:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1257)|

| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| Our first addendum item is Ruby Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1266)|
| 0:21:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| I know on June 21st was the first in a two-year period cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| On July 11th, the remedial plan was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| And then on September 24th, cited a second time for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| And then on 27th, notice of administrative hearing was sent and received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| And then on October 11th, a revised remedial plan and fine was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1304)|
| 0:21:57| Can you tell us where, well, where you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| I guess state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Tasha Blakeney, 400 West Church Avenue, Suite 101, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| I represent Ruby Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| We have submitted a remedial plan to address this unfortunate second violation, which occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1331)|
| 0:22:20| toward the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| As you will note from the remedial plan, a couple of significant changes have been implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| by Ruby Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| First and foremost, I think the thing that would be of most interest to this group is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| that Ruby Tuesdays will now essentially change its policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| If there is a person who attempts to purchase beer who presents a, what we call a red box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| ID, then that person will simply be refused service, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| So that is a significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| And if a person presents with that ID, then a server or bartender will advise a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| that service has been refused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| So that is a very significant change and something that is going to be done across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| for any purchases at this Ruby Tuesday location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| So that is probably the first and foremost thing that I think that this group would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| In addition, as you will note on page two of the remedial plan, there are daily reminders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| now that are going to be used at the start of each shift for Ruby Tuesday servers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| bartenders to remind that there will be a straight up refusal for any guest who presents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| a red box ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| There will be additional emphasis on checking IDs, using available technologies, making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| sure that there are reminders and appropriate signage, bless you, for the date of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| that would be applicable for a date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Bless you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Also, there is additional mandatory retraining that is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Here with me is Amanda Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| She is the area coach with Ruby Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| She is herself an East Tennessee native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| She lives in Loudoun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| She is committed to and interested in the safe service of patrons of Ruby Tuesday and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| a safe community here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| She is redoing service and making sure, redoing training and making sure that absolutely no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| servers, and of course all servers and bartenders who are hired are properly credentialed, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| we're going to make sure at Ruby Tuesdays that no one hits the floor until they've gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| through Ruby Tuesday's own training as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| And frankly, that's what happened between number one and number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| So, those are the changes that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| I'm happy to entertain any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| We hope that the group will find that this remedial plan is satisfactory and permit Ruby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| Tuesday to go forward and work through this new proposed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1484)|
| 0:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Yes, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| So, I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| If someone turns 21 and they don't go and get a new license and they're 22 now, it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| seems like there are going to be some issues come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| I don't disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Probably going to have some angry patrons or potential patrons, but as an abundance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| of caution until they can get a new ID, then that's just going to have to be the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| at Ruby Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| And that's just a business decision they have made that they intend to do it that way for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| the time being just to make sure that they're very safe and very cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| I appreciate the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| I think the Red Box ID will present some other challenges, but that's up to you all, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| It seems like most of the remedial plan included retraining of existing processes and reminders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| But I think I saw that the second failure was placing a server in a situation before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| she was properly trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| So is there a policy change there where you don't put somebody in front of folks before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| they're fully trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| That's exactly right, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| That represents a change as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| And that is something, in fact, that Ms. Miller and I discussed and she is absolutely, she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| making the rounds to all of the locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| So the second violation was a new server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| This was a person who, again, had appropriate credentials and had been trained but had not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| yet gone through Ruby Tuesday's training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| So from now on, servers who have not yet done the internal program will not be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| to serve beer on the floor as bartenders until they've done the internal program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| And then my last question is there's a number of best practices listed on the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| remediation plan, including using a point-of-sale software, incentive program for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| in-house compliance checks, incorporating prevention materials from the Metro Drug Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| in your training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| I noticed you checked no for all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Is there any reason, I mean, did you consider all of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| You don't have to give me a response for each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| But those are four things that I believe you checked no for and those would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| So I appreciate the severity of the red box new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| But there are other measures that have proved helpful, I think, for other businesses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| it seems that you are choosing not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| I'm sorry, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| I'm not finding the no boxes checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Can you tell me where you're referencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| I just may not have that right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| There's a decent chance I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Well, it may be that there's a distinction between the initial plan and the one that was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| just earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| I'm looking at, I think I have both of them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| And the older one from the June 21, 2022 citation, I think, might be what you're looking at with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| some of the no boxes checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| But I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| I don't want to presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| I don't want to presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| I'm looking at the correct thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| So there are two remedial plans in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| The first was dated this summer, earlier in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| And then there was a second remedial plan, which does not resemble the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| It's more of a legal-looking document that Ms. Blakeney has filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| It was received on October 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| And that's my bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| I was looking at the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| No, fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| The first one was filed after the June citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| And the second one that's more of a narrative was submitted October 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Council Member Smith, is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Well, thank you, Mr. Johnson, for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| I was confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| I was, like, scrolling and scrolling and trying to find the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Along, to follow up, Ms. Blakeney, you were here with us for the last remedial plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| I'm having flashbacks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Or were you representing a different client?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| I was representing a different client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| I don't think I've been here before for Ruby Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| I'm having flashbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| It's possible, but I've slept since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| But I think this is my first time for Ruby Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| So, the last time, when they got cited, they just submitted a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| They didn't come to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| So, I take it you were maybe not on board or you didn't come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| So, the questions that Councilman Smith just asked, there's several questions here in this remedial plan, the old one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| from the June 21, 2022 date of citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| And so, I just want to clarify, because there's the narrative, and then there's this remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| So, specifically, what he asked is, does your business ever request underage drinking prevention materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| through the Metropolitan Drug Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| If that is checked, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Is that something that is still not done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Like, those are suggested things in remedial plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Is that not something, is there a reason why your client would not be interested in doing that after a second citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| And let me just confer with Ms. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1811)|
| 0:30:22| Ms. Miller has some insight on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| I can tell you that we just received all brand new material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| From the drug commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| I cannot speak to exactly where it came from, but I do know that I just picked it up and delivered it to all 10 of my restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| And they have a representative here, the drug coalition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Yes, she's over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| I can't see you, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Is there someone here at the beer board for these administrative hearings for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| So those are a good resource, because part of the importance is that this alcoholism and addictions are very tied together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1853)|
| 0:31:02| and so they're hopeful to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| It's preventative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| And then going further down, the old remedial plan, so I'm sorry, it's just easier for me to pick things out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1868)|
| 0:31:16| Do you conduct in-house compliance checks in addition to the checks conducted by KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| Your old remedial plan was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| So are you doing those now, in-house compliance checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| So that's also another best practice, like to test your own people and not just wait for KPD to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| And then the other question was do you have an incentive program for checking IDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| I realize that your job is training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Do you have some way of rewarding your employees for constantly asking for IDs and not letting them not do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1904)|
| 0:31:52| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Positive reinforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| And then previously you said you don't have point-of-sale software or portable scanners to check IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| You guys still don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| I just wanted to review those with you because we're doing a second one here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| and those were the questions that were asked before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| and those are all very intentional questions because those are deemed to be strategies for preventing sales to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| And certainly while Ms. Miller is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| we'll make sure to make an introduction and a connection so that they can get in touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| and get those materials and discuss some of those best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Ms. Miller, can I get your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Amanda Miller, 150 Soul Road, Philadelphia, Tennessee, 37846.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| And I echo Council Member Ryder and Council Member Smith's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| and thank you for asking those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Those were some of the things that I actually had in mind as well to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| And I don't want to go too far into what your training plan is at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| You've given us an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| However, this is the second offense in a couple of months, and it's very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| And so it sounds like you have made some changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| but you may want to consider some of these additional things that have been brought to your attention today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| that you guys checked no to just to ensure that you're going 100 extra miles at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| because what we don't want to see happen is you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| and these are just the ones that were caught that doesn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| so we don't know, and just like you don't know, has that happened before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| and it just has not been caught or captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| So I would encourage you to reconsider some of these additional things as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| that hopefully you won't be standing here before us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| Sergeant Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| If you will see me after the meeting, I will go over some things with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| and be glad to offer any help I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| I just have a quick question for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| We have a few options here, but one is to postpone or defer, the other is to take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| and the third is to refer to a suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| And the last option, if this happens a third time within the two-year period, that's automatic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| It's automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| A noncompliance complaint would be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| I don't have any other questions, but at this point, I think the red box idea is pretty serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| and I think if you follow through with some of those best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| I think you should be in the best shape you can be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| So with that said, I would recommend we take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| I do have a question before we move forward as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| So the red box, I do think, is pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| I think one of my concerns with that is if people are trained just to look for the red box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| there are other things such as fake IDs out there that aren't going to have a red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| So I guess I'm concerned of sort of this one-dimensional training of just looking for that red box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| and then not doing any other mitigation, be it some scanners are able to detect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| or other measures to also look at IDs that might hence be fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2132)|
| 0:35:41| Do you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Yeah, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| So we do additional training, and it all starts with filling the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| You know, you take the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| We call it flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| So you touch it, you look at it, and you just go through all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| So whether it's the right material or whether it's, you know, in date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| So we do train all of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| It's not a stop at the red box, but that's a hard stop that we put in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| I have a motion to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| So hopefully we will not see you back, but thank you for all the information and putting forth a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2183)|
| 0:36:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Next, Aramark Sports and Entertainment Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2203)|
| 0:36:57| Me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Tasha Blakeney, 400 West Church Avenue, Suite 101, Knoxville 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| I represent Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Present with me are Mike McDonald and Dave Levins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Mike McDonald is a district manager who is here from Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| Dave Levins is a general manager who is here and is local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| We have, of course, on your agenda today, I'm aware, is the second violation for Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2238)|
| 0:37:28| However, it is worth noting that there was a rather large football game in Knoxville on Saturday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2248)|
| 0:37:37| and we are aware that a third violation occurred at the University of Alabama football game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| so that is something that will be, it's not on the agenda for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| but it will certainly be very soon, again, on the agenda for this body to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| So it was, and we understand, as has already been mentioned here tonight, that upon a third violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2274)|
| 0:38:02| there will be, and I've spoken with Mr. Frost about this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| Aramark knows and understands that upon a third alleged violation, there will be a complaint that will be filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| and at that point, there will be then a referral to a suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| So I wanted to just, I mean, it's the elephant in the room tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| and I wanted to make sure and be candid and open with this group, even though, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| it's not on the agenda for tonight because we were on a second violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| but one did just occur on Saturday, which is not yet in your materials or in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| And again, I understand at that point, we haven't received a formal notice yet at Aramark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| and we haven't received the notification that Mr. Frost described that will be coming with regard to a referral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| So obviously under this procedural position that we're in as counsel for Aramark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| I'm happy to answer any questions that this board might have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| but understanding that it's going to be referred for a hearing at this stage in any event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| then I also understand that this body may prefer to simply proceed accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| So Mr. Frost, to weigh in, the law department evidently is filing a noncompliant complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| based on this third underage violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| so at this point I would see there's no other choice but to refer to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| Well, that is one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| I guess if Aramark wants to say its piece, they're certainly welcome to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| but the way the ordinance is written upon the third violation in a two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| a noncompliance complaint is filed by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| And as of earlier today, I was told it's probably going to be filed tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| So they are going to see a hearing officer about potential suspension or revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2399)|
| 0:40:09| So my ultimate recommendation, because they're already going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| would be to refer this on, but if Aramark wishes to explain the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| or how they're going to remedy it tonight, as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| if the beer board is willing to hear them, they're welcome to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| I'm happy to do however the board instructs me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| I want to be respectful of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| And, again, knowing that that's coming tomorrow and that's where this is heading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| I wanted to defer to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| We've submitted the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Obviously the situation was different when we submitted it to where we are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| because we had a violation on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Mr. Frost, I just wanted to clarify, they wouldn't have to go twice if this body were okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Yeah, so I'm just looking at the revised remedial plan for the second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| Circumstances of the citation, page 235 in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| It's page 3 of the revised remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| Just before kickoff, the signal for the IntelliCheck system became interrupted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| resulting in intermittent failures of the ID scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| to revert to manually checking IDs, including following red box ID confirmation protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| and to continue attempting to use the scanners as a verification tool in case they began working again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| During this time, a server who was manually checking IDs failed to apply the red box ID training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| so they sold to someone who had a red box ID or their ID had a red box on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| And the 24th violation, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Might Aramark consider no red mark IDs like Ruby Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| It would certainly be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Given the environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| It would certainly be something, I think, that would be worth considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| And, you know, everything is on the table at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| and obviously they have a contract with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| and decisions about just how everything is set up in compliance with that contractual arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2537)|
| 0:42:25| has to be addressed with the university as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| But I know Aramark, I mean, obviously goes without saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| they've invested a lot of resources, financial and time and otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| to try to achieve 100 percent compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| even under the volume and the time constraints that they have in these points of transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| And that is, for them, everything is on the table to make sure that they are fully compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| So I certainly think it would be something, I'm sure they would consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| Again, subject to the university approving what they would need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| Might they be able to figure out a way to get the IntelliCheck system like hardwired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| Is it on like a Wi-Fi signal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I mean, what happened there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Yeah, so since that, and that's a great question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| since IntelliCheck became a technology that is available, there have been updates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| And they have now updated that so that even if there's an intermittent interruption to service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| I kind of think of it, because I'm not real tech savvy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| but I kind of think of it as like a backup generator, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| That technology now does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| And Aramark has invested in ensuring that they have the latest version of those scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| So that in the event that there is another intermittent interruption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| they would not be at the mercy of in and out, in and out service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2619)|
| 0:43:47| And, of course, they understand too that, look, this technology is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| but you still have to fall back on your training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| And that is something that they are really stressing with their servers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| And in keeping with what Mr. Frost said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| the opportunity to at least give a little bit of a complexion about what happened on Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| for what it's worth, it was not an Aramark employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| It was a nonprofit organization volunteer who was in his, I want to say, mid to late 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| a retired Air Force officer who I know is extremely upset and disappointed and just feels terribly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2658)|
| 0:44:29| I'm sure this is a terrible experience for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Yeah, I mean, he feels terrible about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| I've not spoken with him directly yet, but I know that immediately upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| because we had people, knowing how serious Saturday was, we had folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| I was there as counsel walking around and checking things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| I mean, they were taking this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| And it's disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| It's nice to have the nonprofit groups who have some ability to volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| and have some financial support for their organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| And Aramark understands they are responsible for everyone who serves in that circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| But I just wanted to point out the circumstance that occurred on Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| the details that we're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Again, we haven't gotten the letter yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| I know it's coming, but we haven't gotten it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| And I feel like it's been a year since about the volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| And I understand the importance, because I know organizations that have done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| but I wonder if beer is not, and checking IDs should not fall to these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| And then the last thing I'll say, and I'm going to give it up for my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| is if it's going to be IntelliCheck or whatever system that relies on a signal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2739)|
| 0:45:47| that the answer is, sorry, we can't sell beer right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| especially if you look like you're under 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| I know that's not the answer people want to hear, but I understand what you guys are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| There's a lot of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| But we can't be excusatory and say, but we're going to sell to minors accidentally every single weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| That seems unconscionable for us to say, it's okay, you're serving a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| You're going to miss a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Sure. No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| We're not doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| If we say, well, we get it, it's a lot of people, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| We totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| And I bring that up not to ask for that type of accommodation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| but just to simply give some, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| to give some complexion to the circumstances that occurred on Saturday and in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| If it pleases the beer board, I could shed some light on exactly what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| the second and third offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| The second offense, I had two cadets in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| One was approximately three people ahead of the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| The first one, his ID was scanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| He was turned away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| The second one went, a different employee waited on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| She did not bother to card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| The third offense, my cadet was not carded at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| That's exactly what happened on the second and third offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| And Sergeant Coward, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| And so when Aramark first approached the beer board with their permit request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| there was a lot of robust conversation around all of these scenarios up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| and including volunteers, nonprofit volunteers serving there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| And Aramark knew that they would take the responsibility on if someone in that group of volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| were to not card or for whatever reason sell to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| And so they knew going into it that this would be part of their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| So even now, after hearing the facts, it didn't matter if the scanners were down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| because they weren't even carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| And so, again, as my colleague stated, how many others were sold to that just didn't get called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| And so this is a very serious situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| Every game there is an overabundance of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| And so we can't use that as an excuse either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Aramark knew that going into this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| the sheer volume and numbers of people that would be trying to be served at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| And so, again, a very serious situation that will be interesting to see how it comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| But you just cannot, I guess at this point, the odds are kind of stacked against you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| unless you have those scanners and you have people committed to scanning every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| Aramark cannot be there and watch every person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| So, I mean, this is just the risk that you take and the consequences that ensue because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| I believe the original reason for utilizing nonprofits was staffing challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| That is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| And there is an additional benefit of those nonprofits receiving some of the proceeds, which is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| but is the staffing challenge still a barrier to staffing up with Aramark employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| Less so, and thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| I asked that question just this afternoon to Mr. McDonald, who is present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| and he believes that there's just thankfully there are more people available and ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| and willing to return to the workforce now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| and so there is at least some ability, we believe, to reconsider that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| I imagine that consideration is still being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| It is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Undetermined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| And certainly it's been discussed a lot since Saturday, as you might imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Ms. Blakeney, when these permits were given for these locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| part of the reason why you were required to have the point-of-sale software was because of the volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| and, you know, you're also utilizing volunteers and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| And so, I mean, this board has already considered that, you know, this is a difficult task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| but, you know, that's why we have those safeguards in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| The part that, you know, concerned me as well, as well as the third violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| I very much so appreciate you coming and telling us that right off the bat, that there's a third violation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3045)|
| 0:50:53| But in the circumstances of the citation from September 17th, it says, and this is on page 231 of our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| the server checked and scanned the agent's ID, but the agent was nonetheless sold an alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| Yeah, that's, it's troubling and perplexing to Aramark as well, as you can imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| because they, again, they've invested so much in training and technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| and it's really hard to explain, understand, or justify the human error that takes place when that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| So we share that frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| All I can say is, of course, that person received both a criminal citation and lost their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| You know, there are consequences for that, and we have to hope that that measure of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| there's got to hopefully be some learning lessons for the people who continue to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| You know, we have deterrence that we recognize as a goal to make sure that folks understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| you can't get so hurried and so complacent that you don't use the tools that you've been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| And I'll say, too, another thing, and I appreciate very much your comments about knowing that this was going to be a very difficult task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| One of the things, Aramark's management team had a phone call, an initial phone call with the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| This is a little bit different than a scenario where they own the building or they're leasing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| and they have some authority to make physical changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| But one of the things that they're considering and talking about is whether there are some physical things that can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| quite literally setting up some barriers, if you will, so that before you can even get appropriately into a line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3147)|
| 0:52:36| you have a person, not a person who's handling money or serving, but literally a person who's going to check IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| That is that person's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| And then we use some kind of barriers to funnel people in and have folks who watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| and make sure that we are not letting anyone in or out of that line, or I guess more into that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| who wouldn't be authorized to be in the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| So that is a discussion that we've had as recently as yesterday afternoon with the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| to try to determine if there are ways that they are willing to work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| to make sure that we are doing everything that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| And I think having those discussions, obviously there needs to be additional guardrails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| because we're continuing to see this, and none of us want to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| We love seeing you, but we don't want to have you here because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| We don't want to hear about these violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| We don't want to see them happening, and so additional guardrails are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| And I'll turn it over to my colleague, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| But I'm certainly in support of going to a revocation hearing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| I mean, I think we've done everything we can to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| I appreciate your candid statement at the beginning, but we can't have this continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| and so more discussion is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Just three quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| I think you don't have an easy job, but you have a big responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| and I think the university is in the best interest of them to work with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| to invest whatever capital is required to make this successful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| And the third thing being I agree with my colleague, given the third offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| I don't see any reason beating around the bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| I'm just going to go ahead and motion that we refer to suspension hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Dr. Seckins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| So before the process and revocation hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| we have more home games between now and likely when you will go in front of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| So I'm curious to know, again, sort of what your strategy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| And then to Mr. Frost, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| your track record as far as should there be another violation this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| the following weekend, or any time before the revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Well, they'll be able to sell this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| If they pick up another citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| I'm sure the noncompliance complaint will be amended to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| But I guess there is a chance before the end of the regular season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| that there will be the suspension revocation hearing held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| And then just knowing that as far as moving forward this weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| and the following sort of strategy on that to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3323)|
| 0:55:32| Certainly there's significant acknowledgement that much is riding on the UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| versus UT Martin football game on Saturday to ensure complete compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| They're very much aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| And, again, those conversations with the university will continue to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| between now and Saturday to make sure that Aramark has authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| to make some physical changes as they see fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| to make sure that they're doing what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| And then, of course, they'll have to make some decisions about staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| All right, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| All right, so the consensus is to refer Aramark to a revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| And so fingers crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| I had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221018?start=3391)|
