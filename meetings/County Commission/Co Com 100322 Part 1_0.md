| 0:02:06| disobedient and all of us were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=126)|

| 0:02:59| our character is always on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=179)|

| 0:03:03| what's right is always on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| line. And at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| when we all lay our pillows down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| on our head we have to ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=191)|

| 0:03:27| God of our hearts? James Weldon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| Johnson would put it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| God of our weary years, God of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=211)|

| 0:04:29| guard everything about us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=269)|

| 0:07:58| like for us to pass that may help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| And after conversing with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| law director, he said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=482)|

| 0:16:05| Point of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Resolution 911 had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| negative vote so it should not have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=971)|

| 0:16:33| small corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| one on Resolution 801| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| it's a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| of a moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| not a memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| that was just misstated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| but on Resolution 909| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Audit Committee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| audit of Knox County Solid Waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| by KPMG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| just a note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| from the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| we are sensitive to the overall cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| so that doesn't come at any cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| it comes at a reasonable cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| and in fact KPMG will make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| recommendation to us for two parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| of the audit so we will consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| and make sure that the Commission is surprised at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| Also speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| I question whether or not maybe full Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| maybe needs to express exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| what their feelings are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| about these audits and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| the Audit Committee's direction should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| now that may not be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| maybe we have enough direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| from what's being stated in this caption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| but if there is any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| if there is no one wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| offer anything to the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| then we will continue on following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Commissioner Lupo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| How much this is going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| No sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Well we will get a cost estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| meeting of the Audit Committee I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| in early May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| maybe 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| And will you come back before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| with that to be approved at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| We certainly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| That would be the only thing I ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| once you have the cost to bring it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| I guess to approve the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| That's correct I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| That was my interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| of what should be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| I just want to make sure that it's understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| I want to make sure that it's in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| If it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| then I want that to be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| That's understood by the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| It would be at the May meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| because we would meet May 11 so it would be two weeks later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| And as long as that's in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| I'll make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| if we don't have a consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| The consent items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1134)|
| 0:19:04| I just want to ask a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| about 103 about Larry Hussle's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| I just want him to come up here and tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| is he really retiring or is that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Are you really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| retiring Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| I just want to thank Larry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| I mean we had a reception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| for him down at Red Cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| and he spent 30 years of volunteering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| him and his wife and family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| and I just want to thank him for that dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| I don't think he's retiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| I think it's mainly just for his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| I guess Mark may want to say something about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Mark let me get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| for approval all in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1190)|

| 0:19:56| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Commissioner Harmon for bringing that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| That went from last week recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Larry for all of his 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| service to this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| him retiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| I saw that this morning and I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| well there's something here I didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| and to my great surprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Larry didn't know it either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| He may want to come up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| and get an award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| I guess this is the result of a difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| budget time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| We hate to break it to you in front of all these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| I've been gone for a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| I've known Larry for well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| over 25 years and it's been a pleasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| to be a colleague of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| early on in our careers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| and now too. I can tell you Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1240)|

| 0:25:09| before me is something that makes me very proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| a proclamation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| on behalf of the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| by the Mayor's Office and also by the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| to publicly recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| the West High School Wrestling Team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| for winning the District 2-AAA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| and Regional 2-AAA Championships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| and for qualifying for the State 2-AAA Championship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| for the very first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| in the program's history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| and I think you have an outstanding group of young folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| standing behind me here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| with their coaches and wrestling is a tough sport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| because I can tell you after it's over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| there's no blaming your teammates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| it's you and somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| so you've either done it or you haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| and I think it's a character building sport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| and one that requires a lot of discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| maybe other than long distance track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| where you have to be in as good a shape as you are to wrestle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| for those six minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1553)|

| 0:26:50| anytime you win a championship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| especially for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1612)|

| 0:26:56| that went into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1616)|

| 0:27:52| this is just a, we had 6 guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| 2 years ago and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| had 22 come in this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| and it was our goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| to win the region this year and we ended up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| winning the region. Hopefully one day we can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| do as good as like Cleveland does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| at State but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| that's for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| but we appreciate it, thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1690)|

| 0:28:56| for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1736)|
| 0:29:12| You did say 5 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1754)|

| 0:29:40| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| to come publicly and to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| All the members of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| communication from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| church in regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| the issue at heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| that is the tax issue concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| the New Testament Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| It is not my desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| nor my endeavor to try to educate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| on what you already have because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| that would be a lesson in futility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| I would just simply be reading to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| what you already have and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| what you have already read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| But our concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| simply this as a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| as a servant of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| and as responsible citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| we feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| there is a gross error in the treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| of the church as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| to the tax issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| concerning the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Tax Assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| And the key question before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| is why did New Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| not file and not get a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| from the state and our response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| simply is this is that New Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| paid for legal representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| on two separate occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| to represent its interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| and in both instances we feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| we know that our attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| neither articulated our requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| when the deed for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| or when the deed rather to New Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| from the selling church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| rather was presented to the Tax Assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| The Tax Assessor of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| did not advise nor make New Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Baptist Church aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| that we needed to get the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| permit from the state for tax exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| purposes and since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| that time this issue has arose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| we have been advised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| of our responsibility to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| but we also are aware that the Tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Assessor has an obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| to do at least a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| One is maintain a list of churches with an exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| permit and then to refuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| tax exemption to any church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| until that permit is obtained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| In 1993| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| the Tax Assessor treated New Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Canton Hollow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| property as tax exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| and never told New Covenant Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| that we needed the exemption permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| The Tax Assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| equally sent a tax document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| acknowledging New Covenant as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| the owner of that property at Canton Hollow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| and also that the property was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| exempt. 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| our church moved to a new and larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| church on Starkey Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| and when we bought that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| prior to developing that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| the Tax Assessor assessed that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| and taxed us for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| and we paid taxes on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| so there was a period in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| in which we owned two pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| one in which we were tax exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| the other in which we were paying taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| because the property was not used for tax purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| but at no time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| during the 12 year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| that we occupied the 209 Canton Hollow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| property did the Tax Assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| assess us nor come and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| remind us of those responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| We believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| under law if the Starkey Lane property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| was a substitute for the Canton Hollow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| property then tax free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| exemption would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| pass over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Immediately after the Noss County Assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| New Covenant Baptist Church aware of the permit requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| and advised us that we needed to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| a New Covenant obtained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| those permits. We contend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| we would have done that in 1993| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| if that same Tax Assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| had performed his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| or her duties as it relates to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| As tax paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| and law abiding citizens of this great state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| and of this great county we are aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| that the law provides penalties for the Tax Assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| who negligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| fails to enforce these permit requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| and it is a matter of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| that the responsible Noss County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| Assessor did not follow the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| and perform its statutory duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| As the New Covenant Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| and as tax paying law abiding citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| this letter is to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| our objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| this opportunity rather to express our objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| to Noss County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| for attempting to collect taxes from New Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Baptist Church when those taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| are technically and primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| due only because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| a Noss County official violated the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| by not making the New Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Baptist Church aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| of and requiring us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| as a church to get the subject permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| prior to 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| 2006 we did get our permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| we did get it approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| by the State Board of Equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| we contend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| the 12 years in which Noss County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| did not collect tax from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| we contend that our exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| was based on the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Noss County conveyed to us that we were exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| and did not attempt to collect tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| from us so we put ourselves in position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| that we were not benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| of that but we were tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| law abiding citizens and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| adhere to the law as it was communicated to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| but we feel it's unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| that because of an error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| of the tax assessor that it becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| punitive on our part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| thus we become punished for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| that is beyond our control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| and so we appeal to you to wrong this right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| and to make it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| with the church that serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| to better our community, to serve our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| community and do the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| that we believe are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| within adherence to the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| we feel the New Covenant has not violated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| any law, we feel the New Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| has abided by the law and we've done everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| that we've been asked to do and yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| in spite of all of that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| been unduly punished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| by a tax amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| at the time that we got the notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| $32,000 and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| I'm hearing now $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| in taxes that we're being required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| to pay as a church. We feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| is unfair, we feel that is unjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| and we feel that that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| rectified. I think my five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| minutes is up but I thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Yes, I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| I'd like to address to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| It sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| the church, and thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Reverend Brabson for the devotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| you gave us a very good devotional this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| this afternoon also, but it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| the church maybe through inadequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| legal advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| and some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| incidences that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| due to no fault of their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| got caught in this quandary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| who can redress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| if it is felt that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| other than just the courts, is there any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| that this commission can act either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| through a specific ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| excluding them from these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| past taxes if that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| desires and the wishes of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| which would of course take two readings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| over a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| or is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| authority or who does have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| the authority if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| it's deemed that this is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| caught into a legal quandary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| to remedy this church's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| this is one of those sad situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| where a state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| when the facts and the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| apply to the facts, you come up with an absurd result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| that basically penalizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| an organization that has great works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| for this community and certainly they deserve redress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| the problem is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| this isn't a matter of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| faceless bureaucrat making a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| unfortunately this matter was litigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| before the Tennessee State Board of Equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| and after the conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| of that litigation the state issued a legal opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| and that legal opinion says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| several things, one to answer directly your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Commissioner, this is what the order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| reads, the State Board of Equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| is the only agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| with legislative authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| to grant a property tax exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| of this nature, further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| in the order the state concluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| it is unfortunate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| through a series of events the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| does not meet the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| of the applicable statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| in its order then it does go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| three different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| avenues of relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| that the petitioner can seek in service of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| redress in terms of appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| one of them being a review by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| local chancery court, one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| by a review of the state commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| or a review by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| State Board of Equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| and this issue was ordered February 26th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| the problem you have as commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| is you took an oath to uphold the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| and the laws of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| you've got an issue, an order issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| by a court of competent jurisdiction that tells you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| you may not take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| and then trying to remedy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| this specific action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| as a body politic what you do for one you do for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| so that means any similarly situated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| entity would now be able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| forward and demand the same redress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| and again the law does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| permit you to do so, so this isn't a matter of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| commission being cavalier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| or not wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| we research this extensively because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| we do feel that the way the law is applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| is unjust but unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| the state in its legal opinion said otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| and said it's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| jurisdiction not yours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| and if they want redress they come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| or they go to chancery court and unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| that's the hand we've been dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| there is no permissive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| situation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| where we could make an exception or go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| beyond the four corners of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| judge's written ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| it's a sad state of affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| but that's the hand we've been dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| Mr. Law Director I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| I feel very confident that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| could pass a non-binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| resolution showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| our support for these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| and asking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| another entity that has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| authority to help these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| and I feel pretty confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| that we could pass a non-binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| resolution just basically saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| we support these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| we recognize them as a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| we hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| other folks that are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| in the authority to rectify this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| will swiftly do so can we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| you can certainly do that sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| I never want to be cavalier and tell people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| go to court but this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| one of these types of litigation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| if this goes to chancery court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| we're talking about expensive costly protracted litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| what they would essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| have to do and I don't want to give them legal advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| I can't I presume they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| competent legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| but what they would essentially do is they would petition the chancery court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| and say this is the state's order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| we disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| and then the chancery judge would then say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| we either concur or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| we reverse that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| but this is one of these cases where you have deposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| testimony, discovery, protracted witness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| statements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| the county's attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| obviously I represent the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| but I would have to in all candor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| if the court asked me what our position was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| we would have to defer to the wisdom of the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| because again we're asking the court to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| a lower court ruling and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| again the state board of equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| operates by its own set of rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| and they're pretty much a self-defining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| public entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I hate a situation where a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| has got to sue a government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| for its tax exempt status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| which is what this looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| is there any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| we can say that if this does go to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| we consider this a friendly lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| and we agree with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| well what we'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| what we would have to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| the complaint is stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| essentially asserts that the state board of equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| was incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| the state board of equalization took testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| and I'd actually have to see how they came about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| but as the county's lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| when there's a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| the only time we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| concede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| when I get a lawsuit that comes into the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| the first thing I do to see if it has merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| if it has merit I call the attorney and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| we have wronged a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| can we work it out and if they have an outrageous demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| that we think is contrary to the county's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| we litigate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| but on more than one occasion if an attorney calls me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| and says you've committed a wrong and they're correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| we don't sit there and go and stand in front of the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| and say well we think they're wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| because that's not how you act as an officer of the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| you concede the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| at this point I can't tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| because I only have their complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| I don't have all the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| if in fact they're correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| then I would defer to the court's wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| and say we don't really have a defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| if we have a defense by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I would have to raise it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| well I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| for the moment I'm going to turn my light off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| I'd like to see what my colleagues have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| I'll be honest with you I'm really at a loss here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| I want to help these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| and I know there's folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| that will use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| religious affiliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| to try to relieve themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| from taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| in fact I thought this was settled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| about three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| I went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| church services at this church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| this is a good church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| and they are doing good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| this country was founded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| on freedom of religion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| and I think that as a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| that we should do everything we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| to encourage religious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| entities no matter what denomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| do whatever we can to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| that they flourish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| and grow so that people will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| options and choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| as to what type of church they go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| so I want to help these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| I'm going to listen to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| and I will probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| come back with a motion if one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| these fine folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| doesn't seem to come up with something that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| can second. Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Mr. Chairman so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| bottom line Mr. Law Director is their only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| redress is to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Chancery Court is that correct? In other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| to overturn the state board of equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| they're pretty much going to have to go to a court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| and a judge is going to have to overturn it we can't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| that. That's correct sir what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| state ultimately ruled in their ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| they said that there are three avenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| of redress reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| by the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| and by commission you're talking about the board of equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| correct a review by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| state board of equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| which would be basically a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| in writing review or thirdly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| a review by the Chancery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| each of which have time restraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| you know again this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| one of these cases where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| the law is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| designed apparently to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| people who do the right thing and do a good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| and every member of this commission has expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| his dismay and asked for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| way around this but unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I'd love to be able to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| tell you to give these fine folks the redress they seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| but we've got an underlying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| order and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| we can't I can't advise you as legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| to disobey a court order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| question for Mr. Phil Ballard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| I see him in the audience back there Mr. Ballard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| if you wouldn't mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| as I've read this lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| part of the allegation is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| property assessor has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| obligation to inform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| individuals or entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| that they do owe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| taxes and I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| state that exactly right but can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| shed some light on exactly what your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| office's responsibility is with regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| to that I think so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Phil Ballard property assessor suite 204| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| city county building and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| when a person applies for exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| that's always been a state program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| if they were to come to our office call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| we would get them the correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| paperwork which would be an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| that would have some instructions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| and it would also have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| fee schedule I don't find that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| application which I have is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| a series of 14 questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| overly burdensome or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| troublesome and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| they would send it to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| the state would reply and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| have an answer for them or if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| needed additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| but from the point that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| then it's all within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| state process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| now what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| the reason that we're addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| on the correspondence back from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| and I talked with Fred this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| so I can sort of speak for him a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| once the state has made a ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| we get a copy of the ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| we're the body that has to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| change order whether they stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| exempt or whatever we pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| that information we take the change order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| provide it to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| to either exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| the property or he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| sends a tax notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| at the appropriate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| one of the things that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| a little bit hard to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| is that when they make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| an appeal then we're either compelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| or we're required to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| during the time of appeal just like we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| at the Board of Equalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| it's more of an advisory capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| it comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| as an adversarial type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| arrangement in that as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| heard our law director there say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| it paves the defense by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| the statute that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| the law director's office is there they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| to present that on behalf of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| because some entities do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| tax and some will be exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| so we're sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| and it gives us an appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| this property assessor wants to always be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| proactive not combative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| to good people like the Reverend in the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| but the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| has recognized that in a group with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| trustees and property assessors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| 90 to 120 days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| that will no longer happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| they will have the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Board of Equalization will have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| representative there we may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| in an advisory type capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| but at no time can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| in all 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| counties and with all property assessors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| and their staff can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| ever take and do an exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| that is headed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| in this area by Emily Bennett at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| state she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| really good at what she does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| part of the reason that you go to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| board and administrative judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| is the vast majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| is resolved and you don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| go on to Chancery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Chancery Court is just the natural order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| of appeal the commission that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| reports about it is sort of like a supreme court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| down in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| they hear very few cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| and like our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| has said this is the quickest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| and most economical way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| for this church to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| but the role of the property assessor is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| we're put on notice to monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| we receive the orders from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| we do the necessary change orders that goes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| trustee and he does his job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| here again we're placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| at the time of the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| sitting across from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| that gives us the appearance that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| something to do or some control over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| when again we have none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| you know I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| an extremely complicated and sticky situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| I fully understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| but I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| bottom line is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| they're a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| I don't think we have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| arguments with the merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| of the fact that they are a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| vibrant and viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| if churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| are exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| from taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| I guess my question is to the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| director then in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| to Commissioner Lambert's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| then why can't we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| they're a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| we acknowledge them as a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| we acknowledge the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| they should not be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| property taxes today or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| in 93 or whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| the time period is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| even if it is non-binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| again I'm not going to argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| with the legalities of it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| but I do think when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| someone's been wrong I don't think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| continue to say well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| since I'm representing the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| that we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| acknowledge or admit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| for whatever reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| these folks were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| wrong in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Mr. Law Director if you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| take a shot at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| I would appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| on that Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Hensley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| when you apply for your application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| there's three requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| before you can be exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| and I'll read the three to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| property must be owned by a religious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| charitable scientific or non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| educational institute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| number two property must be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| actively used purely and exclusively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3043)|

| 0:51:11| owner you're all very familiar probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| with the case down on Kingston Park in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| the church went in it those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| are taxable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| in answer to Mike Hammond's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| question a little bit I didn't mean to hedge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| on it is in the proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| part there's no way that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| anticipate every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| scenario this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| my understanding Jim Weaver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| recreated the file the best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| going back 17 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Eric could answer anything out of the file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| but we cannot anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| because that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| will have to be put to its intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| use and Reverend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Branson addressed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| the church property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| at its first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| location was exempt the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| property the second location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| they pay tax on until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| 204 because it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| put into its intended use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| so there's this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| is a complicated matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| most of the people in this room the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| when I get a call from media it takes a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| of research and until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| that property is put into its intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| use then there's tax required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| so if they have a day care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| it would be like St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| you know we're not just talking about churches here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| there's five subgroups or four subgroups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| if a St. Mary's has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| a exempt piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| property but they hire physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| therapy comes in and leases that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| then that lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| becomes taxable the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| lot which is shared might be taxable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| or fortunate taxable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| same way with the heating and cooling system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| part of it is taxable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| maybe part that goes to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| that are for profit would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| not would be subject to tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| so they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| have counsel they received the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| notice every year and paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| piece of property what they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| they was a church of God if I believe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| occupied that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| and at some point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| it became new coveted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| at this church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| they were able to stay under that rightfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| or not they were able to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| under that exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| until they moved at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| time when you move location it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| required that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| should apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| exemption well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| here again the property assessor there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| too many scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| in this or any other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| that we cannot anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| when to tell them I suspect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| came out in 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| partially billed and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| they received notice that they were being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| taxed thus probably they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| filed the exemption this comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| in different things we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| a young couple that has a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| their father give it to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| and they rent the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| that's taxed at 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| young lady wants to move out get a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| they do they rent out both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| it's commercial he doesn't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| it's taxed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| at 40% he has become a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| young business man with an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| so these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| happen the best thing to do is check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| with the property assessor but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| no way with the thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| of scenarios that we can anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| and buy because what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| is when the deed is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| filed it goes to the register of deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| it comes over to our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| we stamp it and make a name change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| to who will receive the tax bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| because on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| register of deeds the warranty deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| it has a notice who the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| bill will be sent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| this organization here did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| receive a tax bill each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| they received a reappraisal notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| they were aware that taxes were being paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| when they moved the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| then unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| either through council or through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| lack of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| misunderstandings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| they applied after they received notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| and then this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| statute driven under the constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| they made their appeal the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| was not denied it was granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| the other thing is in sort of equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| you cannot go back because we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| the question why don't you go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| because the paper sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| read that they didn't pay their tax and collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| all 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| you can only go back two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| or forgive two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| so and I think that's part of what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| happening but if we're going to get in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| technical type questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| I would prefer Jim Weaver to come here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| I did get a little bit of bail policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| a couple weeks ago the longer I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| the more slurred it gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| and he would be a little fresher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| with that type of knowledge if you all want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| on that trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| Commissioner Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| two things first apparently the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| at community television and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| are having volume problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| I'm wondering if I can get a signal from the booth up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| if they fixed them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| still having problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| saying like no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| and apparently PBA and CTV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| are pointing fingers at one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| let's just get this resolved I think the community deserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| to hear this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| but the second and more important thing I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| where do we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| I don't want to wander into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| the intricacies that Phil has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| outlined and I don't want to exceed our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| authority as outlined by the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| I think a simple resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| like the following wording might be the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| and here I'm going to suggest some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| wording as a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Knox County Commission expresses sympathy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| for the unusual tax situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| faced by New Covenant Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Knox County Commission further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| expresses hope that all relevant authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| recognize the unusual tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| circumstances faced by New Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| Baptist Church does that sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| like a reasonable expression of our concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| without exceeding our authority I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| that's approximately the way we should approach it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| and if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| appropriate I will make that as a form of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| if the law director doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| have a problem with that I'll second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3431)|

| 0:57:17| I'm going to read that again for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| well prior to adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| the resolution we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3443)|

| 1:00:46| Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you commissioners, and I will try to be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| The commission expressed its interest in my coming back and talking about our budget situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| as it develops, and we made a presentation to the Board of Education last week regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| our budget so I just wanted to share that information with you and while we have a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| challenging and complex situation I hope that it will be actually that we're addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| these in descending order of complexity and I can get through this in relatively short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| order for you to understand where we are and what we're trying to do with our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| So I'll start with the situation that we face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| We are, because our budget is approved by the Board of Education before it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| the Commission, obviously we need to start those conversations relatively early in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| springtime and we begin by making some assumptions and doing some analysis around revenue, likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| revenue and expected expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| And as I noted to the Commission last time I was here, when we looked at that initial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| our initial assumptions, we really saw a fairly substantial gap between what we anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| as our likely revenue and what we anticipated as our expected expenditures and I'll walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| you through sort of where we are right now but our initial gap was about $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| We've worked through that, we've worked that down a bit but our initial assumptions led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| to a budget gap of about $19 million that we need to either make reductions, reallocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| or identify efficiencies or identify additional revenue in order to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Over the last several weeks we've worked through those questions and concerns and issues and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| frankly have put in place some fairly substantial budget reductions that are going to get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| to a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| We'll start with revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Our assumptions around revenues are largely level funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| There's a couple of items in here that I think I would like to call your attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| One is if you remember at last month's meeting the Commission approved a transfer of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| from the Great Schools Partnership to the Knox County Schools of the Kindergarten Intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| So on the revenue side that shows an increase of $1.18 million but it's really both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| revenues and the expenditures that go along with that program come together so it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| budget neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| The other is under the miscellaneous item that we have on this revenue chart there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| also a one-time reimbursement from the Energy Efficient Schools Initiative or what's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| the EESI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| That's $1.2 million and that's really a one-time source of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| It is a reimbursement for work that we've done but it is an available source of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| So what you see in our preliminary budget assumption on the revenue side is when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| look at non-transfer recurring revenues we're looking at our assumption of about a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| and a quarter in increases in the basic education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| That's based on the Governor's budget and that's based on an inflationary increase in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| the Governor's budget for BEP and obviously that will go through the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| but we feel fairly confident that that level of additional revenues will be available through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| So unfortunately when you look at non-transfer recurring revenue going from fiscal year 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| to fiscal year 11 we're looking at a one-third of one percent increase in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| I think it's fair to say that's roughly level funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| If we then look, this is just another look at the revenues in terms of where they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| from, sales tax, property tax and state funding and I think you know better than I that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| tax has been relatively flat with a slight increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| Sales tax over the last year has sort of fallen off and is beginning to stabilize at a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| lower level and state funding has been relatively steady state and those are the three major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| sources of income and revenue for the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| Some additional expenditure obligations that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| I think I won't walk you through this line item by line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| It's all in the detailed budget document that you've received but a couple of them I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| One is retirement contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| This is a huge hit for us, 5.7 million dollars for the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| That's an increase of 5.7 million dollars in one year and that's a tough one to swallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| It's a difficult one to swallow in a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| In a difficult budget year like the one that we're having, it's enormously difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| I think you see we are in conversation right now with our employees, particularly with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:24| our teachers association around compensation and what I have asked is based on the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| that we had and the gap that still remains even after some fairly substantial reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| is that we don't look at any increases in compensation for the coming school year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| that's a tough, really difficult dynamic for folks and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| It's a really difficult dynamic to ask for but I think that's really where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| I'll show you on the next slide when we get to it the types of cuts and reductions, reallocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| that we have put in place or proposed to the Board of Education and there's really no easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| choices left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Last year's budget was very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| We had to close about a 12 million dollar budget gap to get to a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| This year we're closing a 19 million dollar gap and we're still about a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| away as we speak so there's no easy answers in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| The economy that affects all of us in East Tennessee, families and businesses, obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| affects us in public service as well and so we're facing some really substantial challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| You see the 1.18 million dollars for kindergarten intervention, that's the expenditure side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| of the increase in revenues and increase in debt service of about a million dollars and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:42| that is based on largely our prior year spending on capital projects, very reasonable, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:50| important capital spending projects and school building projects that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| And then a few additional things like unemployment, ELL is English Language Learners, those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| students for whom English is not their first language and we're seeing an increase in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| number of students who come to us not speaking English as their first language and they require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| ESL services, English as a Second Language services and we have some requirements for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| that and why don't we move on to the next one which is some of the things that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| done to try to now close this gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| So we've made, we've proposed reductions in our central office and you see that 3.55 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:27| dollars, central office and system wide reductions, that's positions, that's, those are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| unfortunately and those are services that we provide to support our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| Staffing model, the first line item, 1.07 million dollars, that's also largely positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| It's, what we, if you recall from last year we put in place a budget formula for our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| and we believe that budget formula makes our allocation of resources to schools fair and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| transparent and equitable and rational and, but unfortunately we're not doing this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| a budget neutral environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| We had to put in place the formula in such a way that actually saved us some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:14| I want to make the point and I think it's an important one that when you look at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| of these different areas of savings, and I believe it's on the next slide, after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| next one after that, that if you look at the reductions that we are proposing, if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| at the, unfortunately the very difficult tradeoffs that we are facing, what you'll see is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| we're trying our very best to keep the impact of those budget reductions away from the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| So if you look at the middle column there, it's called instruction and instructional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| support, we're facing about a 1.2 percent reduction in our spending there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| But if you look at administrative operations and maintenance, technology, things of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| nature, we're looking at a much higher proportion of our spending being cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| I will note that there's one area that's a zero there, that's human resources and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| After the shooting, unfortunate incident we had, shooting incident we had at Inskip Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| School on February the 10th, we have brought together a safety and security committee to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:13| take a look at our infrastructure around safety and security, to take a look at our infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| around human resources, protocols and practices stemming from that incident, and so I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| want to make any reductions there pending the outcome of that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| But I think what you see is our attempt to really keep the reductions that we are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| forced to make by the flat revenue that we have and the increase in expenditure obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| as far away from the classroom as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| I appreciate the Teachers Association is in conversation with us right now about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| are our options and how do we proceed, and as I said, as this slide shows you, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| still about a million dollars away from being able to present a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| I intend and expect that I will be able to present a balanced budget to the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| Education at its next meeting, at the voting meeting, but really we have very few options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| left to be able to close that $1 million gap, and I think they fall into basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| One is solutions around compensation, and if we are able to propose and implement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:21| negotiate a situation where our employees do not see an increase in compensation next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| year, that will allow us to close this budget gap and, in fact, even put back some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| roughly net 30 teacher positions that we have proposed cutting out of this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| The second potential area is looking at health insurance and the employer contribution to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| We have a range that we pay depending on the plan for our employees, but that's not an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| attractive option either because for some folks, if we set a uniform proportion of employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:59| contribution and that saves us some money, that's going to be a take-back, that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| to be money out of someone's pocket, so it's not a particularly attractive option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| And really the only other option that we have on the expenditure side is additional reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| in positions, additional cuts, and we don't want to do that because it would mean fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| people in our schools, fewer instructors in our schools, or fewer support people in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| schools, or fewer folks providing support and service to our schools, so that's a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| challenge as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| The only other place, I think, that might help us get there is any additional revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| that might be available, and there's been lots of public conversation about, well, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| should come to the commission and just ask for more, and I want to be realistic about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| I want to be realistic about the revenue assumptions that we make, I want to be realistic about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| the assumptions we make on expenditures, and we've been working with the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| and Mr. Troyer around some of our revenue assumptions to make sure that they're accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| and appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| And of course, if there is additional revenue that we don't see or that is available, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4316)|
| 1:12:04| will certainly entertain any input you have about how to get that to us and provide additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| But I want to be realistic, I want to make sure that we're fiscally responsible as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| as being educationally responsible, and that's the last point I want to make, is that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| are, on the next slide, many, many important investments that we are still making in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Our goals remain the same, our goal of excellence for all children remains the same, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| of what level of resources are available to us, we still have our goal and vision of providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| an outstanding education for every child in Knox County Schools, and that's not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| I will end there, and I just want to, again, as the Commission has requested, to keep you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| up to date on our ongoing conversation, the Board will vote on its fiscal year 2011 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| at its April 7th voting meeting, and I'm glad to entertain any questions that the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4379)|
| 1:13:06| may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Dr. McIntyre, I appreciate you coming down here, I appreciate the job that you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| you're doing an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| I guess my questions or my concerns deal mostly on the revenue side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| You're projecting a one and a quarter million dollars more from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| I mean, all I ever hear about the state budget is how they're hundreds of millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| short, and I guess you've been in contact with it, but I just find it hard to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| that they can afford to send us more money than last year when their revenue continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| to drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| I mean, what kind of assurances do we really have that you're going to receive an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| as the state's revenue continues to decrease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| We don't have any assurances that we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| We have the Governor's proposed budget, and it is a proposal, and it has to be affirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| and authorized by the legislature and the money allocated by the legislature, but in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4443)|
| 1:14:10| the Governor's preliminary budget, there is a provision for what he calls fully funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4450)|
| 1:14:18| the BEP, and that includes a factor for inflationary increases to the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| Our estimate of what that means for the Knox County schools is about a million and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| There's one piece of that that is unknown at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| The Governor, in his preliminary budget, did not fund inflationary increases for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| component of the basic education program that's called capital outlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| That's about a $27 million difference between what he is calling full funding right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| and what other critics of that are calling full funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| Is that 27 statewide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| And how much of an impact would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| Not all that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| It might mean several hundred thousand dollars one way or the other for Knox County, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| in terms of a $375 million budget, that piece of it shouldn't be all that material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| Well, you just mentioned that you're a million dollars away from it, so from trying to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| it balance with the projections you have, so if you're 1.2, 1.3 million away, it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:25| sounds like that could add to being difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| Understand that out of the larger picture doesn't seem much, but it just seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| I want to make sure that when we approve the budget that you all approve, or whatever budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| we end up approving for you, that we're very confident that the revenue is there so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| halfway through the year or sometime midstream, we're going, you know what, guys, the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| didn't come through, the sales tax didn't come through, and we're going to have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| some other cuts because unfortunately it always seems to be in the classroom, or it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| to be, because those seem to hit the hardest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| And then I have another question, and it may take John Troyer to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| Let me just respond to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| I do feel confident that these are the best estimates we can make with the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| As we move forward, as we get into early April, we should get an initial estimate from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| state of what revenue we should expect in terms of public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| So that will probably help us affirm where we are in terms of our revenues, but based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| on the Governor's proposed budget, that's what we're making our assumptions based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| I understand, and that's the best we could probably do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| You mentioned sales tax, and unfortunately the last I saw was that I believe we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:55| somewhere, as far as Knox County was concerned, several million dollars behind last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| which was behind the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| So I don't know that we have seen the bottom yet, let alone stabilized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:11| John, how are we doing sales tax wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:24| I think your characterization is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| I've been working closely with Dr. McIntyre and his staff about preparing what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| most appropriate budget, and I think they're doing a tremendous job, and so I'm thankful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| for that, and thankful that they want to present to you a very realistic budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| Sales tax is just something that we watch every single month, we continue to be hopeful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| we've had pockets of good news, but it's not as good as we'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| Are we about six million behind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| I think that's a fair assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| And that's behind last year, and last year was not as good as the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| In my opinion, I think we are seeing the bottom, and from my perspective, the question is how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| long is it going to take us to grow back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Well, I'm hopeful too, I'm hopeful for a lot of things, but I just want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| as we move forward, not just with their budget, but with the rest of the county budget, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| on the revenue side, because you've got to start somewhere, and it seems like in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| you've got to start with what your projected revenues are before you even know what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| have to begin to spend, instead of the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| So I have some concerns, and I just want to make sure that we are using the best numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:47| and I believe that you say that you are, but I don't have that in front of me anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:55| What was your projection, if you can get back to that slide, Dr. McIntyre, where it showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| the projected source of revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| Let me just add that this is very high on Dr. McIntyre and his staff's priority, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| they spend a good amount of time in the details of this, and I think they've had a very responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| approach, and when you get to see their proposal, I think you can trust that it will be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:21| And you've got a flat sales tax, and I'm just not totally convinced, taking a look at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| I've seen, that we can even anticipate a revenue neutral, and it's not that I'm trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:38| to chastise, I'm just trying to warn the public out there that these may even, as bad as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| may look, they may be optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| And again, I think our take on this is, certainly myself, having been the budget director for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| the Boston Public Schools for eight years, I have a very fiscally conservative streak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| in me, and really do try to make sure that any revenues and assumptions that we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| any expenditure assumptions that we make, are reasonable, are rational, and are conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| And I think we are, having worked with Mr. Troyer's office, and having worked with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| analysts internally, we are working through the best possible estimates that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| are appropriate, and this is where we are in our current thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Now, it is very early on, so it's very difficult to forecast this early on, precisely what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| the revenues are going to look like, but in terms of the trends that we've seen, in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| of historical analysis, in terms of, you know, and we're kind of, where you are, we're kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| of trying to look at every data point and try to read into that, you know, is that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| good sign or a bad sign, and how should we adjust our assumptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| But we're trying to operate on the information that we have, make the best possible estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| and I'm comfortable that these are, based on the information that we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| the appropriate estimates of revenue for us, and again, we're trying to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| we affirm that with the finance department of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| And I hope you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| Dr. McIntyre, again, I do appreciate you coming and speaking with us and trying to keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| budget as flat as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| Back to the insurance, and I know there's a state law that requires them to, or that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| requires us to pay for their state plan insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| Is there a way, is there a mechanism that, if they chose to enter the county plan versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| the state plan to save money, is that an option for them as a teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| I don't believe it's an option for them individually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| And Mr. Thomas is here and can probably speak to that better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| I don't believe that's an option for them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| I think there's a potential that something like that could be bargained collectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| but that would, as I understand it, would require literally that, for it to be bargained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Yeah, I think, you know, the state plan that, you know, the city and the state plan, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| I don't know if the county was ever on it, but the state plan's extremely expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| And, you know, you guys, I mean, you see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| You don't need me to tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| You know, the 75-25, I don't know, what percentage do you pay of their family or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| individual insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| We pay anywhere from 58% to 74%, depending on the plan and which plan they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:21| What's the cost of that a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| Do you know, Mr. Thomas, something to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| To the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Not the monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| It's, we spend roughly, the employer portion, I think, is about $23 million annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| So, of course, $23 million a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| Have we compared the two insurance plans and maybe asked them if they wanted the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| of, because there's a large savings, I think a teacher probably pays $400 or $500 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| for a family coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| You know, and a county employee pays $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| I mean, they might have some out-of-pocket more, but it's a gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| And sometimes that's what insurance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4979)|
| 1:22:59| We looked, a few years ago, we looked at it, and in order to receive the state monies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| are sent to us, the plan has to be either equal to or better than the state plan, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| then also teachers have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| And I think we actually went through a vote a few years ago, and the teachers voted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| down to come to the county plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| And I think maybe the benefits, probably, of course, the better the benefits, the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| costly the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| And the state plan was a little bit more, I think, luxurious from the benefits standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| And looking at classified employees, of course, they're on the state plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| And with them, it would not be a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| I mean, that is a potential option to look at, in terms of classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| The non-teaching?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| I'm just, I mean, the insurance, I mean, have we tried to bid out a comparable state plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| Have we tried that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I mean, you guys are smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| I'm not, I'm just trying to figure out if there's a way that we can save a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| of money on the, because health insurance for teachers is expensive for them to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| out-of-pocket, and it's expensive for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| If there's a way to get out of it and do something better, or equal, or different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| I think it'd be a good option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| That is an option, too, that would be available to bid it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| It's not been something that we've done in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| And I think the state next year is looking at, from what I understand, revamping insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| And there's going to be several different scenarios, I think, for employees, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| it's an employee and a child, or an employee and a spouse, and then-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| High deductible, low deductible type things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| Dr. McIntyre, where are we on the race to the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Have you received, I know that you were in Washington a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| Does that look promising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| When will we know something about those funds that might become available for Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| Well, I think Tennessee has a very strong application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| We're one of 16 finalists, and we did present, Governor Bredesen led a team to present the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5095)|
| 1:25:02| proposal for the state of Tennessee to the United States Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| We should know that by early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| So we should have that information at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| As we talked about last time, the types of things that race to the top would allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| to do are all great things that are really part of our strategic plan, but it is meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| to be supplemental dollars and not to sort of plug budget holes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| But there are lots of great things that we would be able to do with race to the top dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| that probably we would struggle otherwise to find the resources to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| Things like strategic compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| Things like supporting our leadership academy to really train the next generation of great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| school principals in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Supporting our data warehouse project to provide information and data to our teachers to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| do their job effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| So there's lots of great things in the race to the top that I think will help us move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| things along and do things that we want to do to provide a great education for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| But I'm not sure there's a whole lot that will help us close our budget gap, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| How much money are we looking at for Knox County should we get that race to the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| So the state of Tennessee requested $501 million over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| In terms of how that works, 50% of that goes directly to school districts based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| Title I formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:20| So that portion of it would probably be about $12 to $13 million for Knox County over four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| But there's also other opportunities to plug into the statewide portion of that, the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| $250 million for other competitive type things or things like STEM education or leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| or professional development that we may be able to plug into the statewide portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:42| So it could be really a very nice supplemental source of revenue for us to really do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:50| of the innovative things that we've been talking about in our strategic plan in Excellence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| for All Children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| And I'm optimistic, but we just won't know until early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| We'll know in about two and a half weeks or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| You had said that you're going to be presenting your budget April 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| We might know about the race to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Could you appear before the Finance Committee on April the 19th just to kind of give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| an update on the budget, race to the top, etc.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| If you're not available, if you could send someone from the Finance Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| That's our regular meeting, and I think it'd be helpful for us to get an update on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5242)|
| 1:27:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Yeah, I just wanted to reiterate what Commissioner Leuthold was saying about sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| I actually collect sales tax, and I can tell you, maybe I'm losing my touch, but I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| collected a dime in sales tax all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| Most of it has been because it's just so difficult to get someone financed on an automobile these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| I'm actually at my dealership spending more hours there, so I'm making contact with more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| customers than the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| But unfortunately, just due to the economy, it's hard to get someone financed, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| seeing car dealerships closing up all around me, and I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| I think that predicting flat sales tax dollars, I don't believe that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:20| I know it hasn't happened at my dealership, and I know it hasn't happened at the dealerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| on either side of me that have closed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| So I really do think, and this is more to Mr. Troyer than yourself, I think you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| need to calculate a drop in sales tax numbers this year, because I think that is what seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Commissioner, I think this high-level overview potentially masks the dynamics of what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| seen in the last two years, which is property tax relatively flat or increasing slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| with sales tax dropping off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| So we've shown it both as flat, property tax and sales tax, but there is some potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| that property tax may go up a bit to offset some of the reductions that we might see in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:00| So I just want to make that point, because both of them show flat in this analysis, whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| you could see some growth and some reductions in each of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| Commissioner, can I say one last thing, and that is I think the Board of Education will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| take this up on the 7th, and they really have pushed a lot on, are there additional revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:26| Are there additional dollars to be had for public education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| And certainly I would ask the Commission to certainly think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| We're trying, again, as I said, to be fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| We're trying to recognize the financial state of the county and where we are right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| now, and to present a budget to you that is balanced and is reasonable in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| the revenues that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| It will be important when the revenues do begin to come back, when the revenues do begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| to rise again, for you as a commission, for the Board of Education as a board, and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| us as a community to really think hard about the level of investment that we make in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| education in Knox County, and the level of investment that we want to make in our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:11| So as we, you know, I think we've laid out a really ambitious plan with very measurable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| goals for education in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| I anticipate coming back at that point in time and seeking additional dollars to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| able to do what we know we need to do and what we can do for our children in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| So you'll look forward to seeing me in future years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Oh, yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| Dr. Mack, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Have your employees tried to work with the Employee Incentive Program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| If they come up with an idea that will save Board of Education some money, you then would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| try that idea out for a year and then bonus them part of the savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| I mean, you've got your back against the wall, we've got ours back against the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| All of our Knox County employees, whether it be Board of Education people or those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| that work here at the Sheriff's Department and everywhere, we need everybody to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| up with ways that we can save money and maybe if we can do some employee incentives, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| we can come up with some good ideas because we've got some good ideas that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| submitted to us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| So I just want to remind you that that may still be out there as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| We have not done anything formally with incentives around ideas, but you can rest assured with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| the type of situation that we're facing and the fact that we're asking not to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| additional compensation potentially for next year, we are getting a lot of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| And we have a public forum coming up actually this week on Thursday at the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| And that's at Central High School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Central High School at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| And so we welcome all of our employees and community members to be there and bring ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:55| to the table as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| I mean, teachers know that if they come up with an idea that may save a fellow teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| some of their jobs, you know, I think it would be a good incentive for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| Good afternoon, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| I had a public service announcement back at the last commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| It was run eight for the boys and girls clubs and I participated in that and I finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:26| first in my age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| I've got the little plaque standing here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| But I do want to give a word of encouragement for those that do get out and jog a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| Run for the schools is Saturday, April the 10th at the Knoxville Zoo at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5557)|
| 1:32:46| I believe it's a $15 run, which is really a great bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| You can't run anywhere for less than $20 here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| It's a $15 race, 5k, $2 of it is directly dedicated to some school and the rest of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| goes to supportive schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| It's also a great day to get out because I believe if you participate, I haven't read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| the complete entry form here, I believe you get to go to the zoo for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| So it's like a threefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| You get to exercise, you get a couple of bucks to an individual school and you get to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| to the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| And then also, you might win a piece of glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| I'm looking forward to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| I have to sort of suspend my biscuit habit for a couple of weeks and get back on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| road running to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| But we are looking forward to the Run for the Schools and thank you for that plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| It does help us raise money for our schools and we very much appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5620)|
| 1:33:48| I just wanted to add that the Race for the Schools, if your child attends a Title I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| school, there is no fee to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| You just go and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| And so we hope that a lot of our inner city families will, and I believe there's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| transportation available from some schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| I hope that a lot of our inner city families will get out and participate in that and spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| the day with their family at the zoo afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| Just don't end up like Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| He can hardly stand or walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| I've had to pick up his computer case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| So I hope the rest of you, when you do win, you come out better than he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:28| Dr. McIntyre, I'll pay my $15, but Bud Armstrong is going to run for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:37| That could be negative results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| Next, we're going to have 606 on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee, approving a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| in the amount of $970,300 with the university pathologist PC for services related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| post-mortem services and the operation of the Knox County Medical Examiner's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| You're on page 11 at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5703)|

| 1:35:10| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| 7-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| We have the medical director here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| I think Dr. Mlucinowic would like to speak to the, we had some, we had a few meetings and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| were some questions about her being able to make independent decisions and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| So we had some meetings with Dr. Van Meter and Dr. Mlucinowic and the law department and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| I think she would like to speak to the commission if you guys have any questions or I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| to know if the contract has been approved by the accreditation agency and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:57| My name is Doreen Kamilucinic-Polchan, P-O-L-C-H-A-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| I've been chief medical examiner for Knox County and Anderson County for a while and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| apologize, I am getting over bad calls, so please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| I'm just here to express my opinion and my position on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:19| It's really tightly kind of connected with the accreditation that our office went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:26| The accreditation process took a day and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| It was conducted by Dr. Callery who is the chief medical examiner for Delaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| He was very complimentary of the overall service of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| and in the end, basically what he told us is that at the Knox County medical examiner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| office, we would be fully accredited for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Unfortunately, the regional forensic center, we can get only provisional accreditation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| for about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| The main reason was actually the staffing problem because we have only two full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| forensic pathologists and we do need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| As a matter of fact, his recommendation for the forensic center was four, not just three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| but four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Actually, that's very important to us because it's required by the law and also it proves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:17| our expertise and how well we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| One thing that I have to mention is that even at the Knox County medical examiner's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:27| we were able to be accredited only because we have two forensic pathologists, not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| me, not just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| But that second forensic pathologist, Dr. Caswell, is fully actually funded by the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| of Pathology, not by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| So basically, hopefully this is going to give you some idea that we do need both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| We do need university and Department of Pathology or UPPC to abbreviate to work together with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:56| the Knox County to be able to be, we are able to bring talent to our county to do the proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| forensic work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| And as I said, just one little side note is that in the United States of America, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:11| are only four, about 400 board certified forensic pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| Can you imagine for the entire state, it's just 400 of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| So there are not that many of us, so just to be able to bring two, three or four, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Now, I do have some problems with the wording in the current contract because based on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:33| particular contract, there was no really acknowledgement of the fact that Knox County does have a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| certified forensic pathologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| And I can explain later to you what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| We've been working great with the law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| We, if you, I'm sure if you speak with the Sheriff's Department or KPD, Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| Department, I believe they're going to agree with you that, or with me, that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| doing a great job together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| And I want to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| And that's why accreditation is important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| My problem with the wording was that it's not taking into account the fact that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| have forensic pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| That's kind of neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| There was also a problem with the transferring authority completely to UPPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| And actually, I've been working with Dr. Vamira and UPPC great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| I mean, I have no issues with Dr. Vamira or UPPC whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| But I want to make sure that you understand that I am an employee of Dr. Vamira and UPPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| And maybe that might require a little bit deeper thinking or clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:47| Maybe not in this particular contract, but maybe some contract that is between the chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| medical examiner and UPPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| Because based on this contract, if you read the words, the medical examiner has responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| the state gives me, or whoever is my position, but doesn't really have authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:06| And just because of that, I did contact Dr. Callery, who granted us provisional accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:14| I want to make sure that reading that contract would be in accordance with the name accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6014)|
| 1:40:22| Because when we went through that process, the whole accreditation process does revolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| around the chief medical examiner as a central figure who is bringing that all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| And qualifications of the medical examiner, qualifications of the staff in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| are all very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| So about a month ago, Dr. Callery did accept to review the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| He was not 100% really content with what he was seeing, but there was a way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| And he wanted to make sure that we can all benefit from this mutual relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| So what he did is actually he gave contract to two individuals in the accrediting body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| of the National Association of Medical Examiners, Dr. Jantz and Dr. Fuller, who are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| And I'm expecting to receive their review any day now, but I have not received their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| final opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| So just to let you know that I do support the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| I'm definitely here to support the collaboration and continuing work in progress between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:29| hospital and UPPC or pathology department and the Knox County office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:36| But I just want to also make sure that when all is passed, when the contract is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| it's not in violation with any provisions that the National Association of Medical Examiners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| And because of that, because I'm not a central figure, not just me personally, but just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| medical examiner is not a central figure in this relationship anymore, that that won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| violate any name accreditation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| Dr. Mosvick, do you think that if the contract is approved, do you feel, is Dr. VanMeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Do you feel that we could work through those things if the accreditation, the accrediting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| authority, if we approved it today, let's just say we approved it today, do you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| that there's anything in there that we couldn't fix in a contract amendment if the accreditation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| authority asked for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| I believe it can be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| As I said, and I have no doubt that Dr. VanMeter and I will continue working together as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:42| have so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| My only issue is that things do need to be fixed because if it were somebody else, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:51| I know at least, you know, 50% or plus surgical pathologists, which Dr. VanMeter is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:57| psychopathologists, do not feel the same way, and that relationship might be actually in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6182)|

| 1:43:07| But between Dr. VanMeter, UPPC, and me and our office right now, it shouldn't be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| with the proper amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6193)|

| 1:43:38| that would undermine that assurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6218)|

| 1:48:35| We're going to let Judge Irwin speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| Afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| Thank you all for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| I spoke to most of you in one committee or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| and I won't spend a lot of time with the reasons for this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| I'll just point out that every court in this county has security, process serving provided by the Knox County Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6533)|
| 1:49:04| except for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| Those two courts are city court, which, of course, is the securities provided by the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:13| and juvenile court, securities provided by our own security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| I think it's a dangerous situation for Knox County to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| I think most of you agree that it's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| I have great officers, fantastic officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| There's no problem with their conduct or their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| It's just the problem with who is the head of law enforcement for those 13 men and women, and that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:38| I don't have the requisite training to be a head of a law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| I can imagine myself sitting in a deposition being cross-examined and asking about my qualifications one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| That's a bad situation for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| It's a bad situation for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| I think the main question before us is how much is this going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| We have some exact figures for you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| The total additional expense needed is going to be less than $49,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:09| The officers we're talking to as a body, six of them are taking advantage of the sheriff's retirement program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:16| and seven of them have chosen to remain under the current Knox County program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| Along with the upgrades and more gas they'll need, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| I think $35,620 is the difference minus the pension increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| But the cost will be less than $49,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| We have talked to Kim and Allison and Heidi Garrett, my court director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| and that's the figure that they've come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| Mr. McKenzie in particular asked us for a figure, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| I don't know if you have the money to do this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| I'm asking you to do it for the good of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| I can tell you that if we were embroiled in a lawsuit of this type, our legal fees would be way more than $49,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6654)|
| 1:51:01| I think the law director's office had something prepared on the liability if that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| Otherwise, I'll defer to your wisdom, and I respectfully ask you to consider this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| and I thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| If anyone has any questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| Mr. Chairman, I don't have a question for the judge, but John Troyer, you may want to come down and answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:25| We approved an additional litigation fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| I believe it was $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| $25 was donated or specified for jailhouse security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| and the reports that we're getting from Ms. Quist's office is indicating to us that that's around $30,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:44| Tell us how that money is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| Again, it was specified by the legislature it had to be used, I think, for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| Courthouse, jailhouse security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| Is this part of the money that could be used for that, or how is that being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| We are using it to help the operations of the security as it exists now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:05| We have done a number of small capital improvements towards that that have used up some of that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:12| and I would concur with the judge that $49,000 will go very quickly when you talk about just one lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:23| But if we have $30,000 a month, that's over $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| and if we've made minor improvements, are any of these funds being used for salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| or does it have to go toward hard costs such as technology, that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| It's my understanding that they can be used for salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| and are helping with the general fund which supports the courthouse security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| I guess I just think I want to make the public aware that the men that are going into the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| have to give up their 401K to move over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| And that was the main thing that I had concerns about that I've discussed with some of you commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| is that I didn't think it was fair to make these individuals lose their old retirement and come into our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:15| So we sat down with them and we figured out a way how we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| Seven of them opted to stay on the old plan and six of them opted to come on to the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| I think just in that figure, I think Kim Bennett's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| but I think that was $13,000 is all it cost on the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| But they're not getting their 401K and moving into your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| They're losing their 401K and going into the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| I just want to make the commission aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| Did you want to say anything on that, Ms. Bennett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:51| The six officers that are going to be coming over and fall under the uniformed officers plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| their asset accumulation plan, the 401 plan, their account balance will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| They're not getting any credited service coming over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| So they're starting out day one again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| but they will be a uniformed officer pension plan participant July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:14| Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Well, my concern is the seven that aren't coming over to the new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| and that's probably anybody my age and up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| that in this day and time I hate to see them starting back over day one and losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6866)|
| 1:54:37| Excuse me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| They're staying with the old plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| They're not losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| They're staying on the same plan they're on now and continue to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| They're going to be allowed to stay like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| At the same rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| As I understand it, I wasn't in the meeting because I didn't want to make it uncomfortable for my officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| I wanted to be able to speak freely, but as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| seven have elected to stay where they are on the regular county match 401K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| and six have decided to move, and the sheriff was able to negotiate a choice for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| So as of Friday, the last I heard, they were going to have to start all over brand new, but that's not so, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:12| Six that move to the sheriff's department, their accumulated assets will be frozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| and they'll start at day one on the new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| They won't lose what they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| They won't be able to add to it under the old system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| The seven that are staying under Knox County, now I may be, I wasn't even in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| The seven that are staying under their current retirement would still have the 6% match just like they have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| It wouldn't change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| Judge, the 13, is the additional $49,000 simply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| It's everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| Is that pension operating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| That's pension operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| That's extra for uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| I think the sheriff's department is better uniformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| That's better cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| That's gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| We don't even pay our people at the minimum that the sheriff's level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| That is not just pension and employee costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| No one is making less than they were making before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| Some of them have a $200 raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| Some of the new employees have a built-in about $3,000 raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| That's everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| This is to bring them up to our pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| What we'll do is we bring them up to our pay scale, and it includes maintenance and uniform allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| That's what the less than $49,000 consists of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Judge Irwin will not be the supervisor anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| You don't have the expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| Yours is something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| But Sheriff Jones will be the supervisor and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| They work for him instead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| If this is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| And so a fraction of the cost is joining UOP, and a fraction is other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| I think it needs to be understood, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| We're not keeping this money that went with these officers in the juvenile court budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| We're transferring all that to the sheriff's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I'm not trying to enrich juvenile court here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| They're getting that money, but there's some extra that it will require to be a sheriff's deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| That's not required to be just a juvenile court officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| And some of the extra, their minimum pay grade is above ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:19| Their uniform allowance is bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| They have different requirements as to cars, vehicle, gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| It comes to $49,000 with the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| That's the most it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| It could be less if someone rethinks their opinion and decides not to go on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| But the most it could be is $49,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Will they go through more comprehensive training working for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| Tell me if this is apples to oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| Is this comparable to the probation office a few months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:52| I would say it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| Just people working for another long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| The money is getting swapped from the juvenile court to the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| just as the probation money was swapped from probation to the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| We're not asking for any new funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| It's a swap of the funds plus an extra $49,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| But their payroll here, future budgets will be part of your payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| It will, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| It sounds like a more efficient and professional way to run the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| I think that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| Can I interject something real quick just because of the probation officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| One of the probation officers I know was able to buy back his years of service that he had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| and that would be a difference between that and these officers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7113)|
| 1:58:41| That person had prior service with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| Yes, yes, because he had prior service with the sheriff, whereas these folks do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| None of these have prior service under the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| That's just pointing out a difference between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| Are you finished, Commissioner Luther?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| I had other things, but I didn't know if it was my turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| Your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Kim Bennett, what's the liability attached to the six employees being switched over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:12| Because there's a liability that goes with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| The total liability of the six that are being switched over is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| and this is just for fiscal year 2011, is $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:29| $30,000, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| The other day, or last week, you told us that they didn't have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| They would all have to go under it, but now we're coming back and saying we're going to allow them to choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| to participate or not participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| I'm going to speak from this a little awkwardly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| Allison or the sheriff can speak too, but some of them are coming over as patrolmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:55| The authority to arrest is what I'm understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| and some of them are just staying in as juvenile officers with less authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| Therefore, they're not going to be, that title is not going to be under UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7202)|
| 2:00:08| Would they follow or fall underneath the sheriff merit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7208)|
| 2:00:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| But they're not going to have, they're not going to be sworn deputies that would force them to be underneath that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| I just didn't think it was fair that some folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| some of these officers would actually be hurt greatly financially if they were forced into one retirement or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:43| and I didn't want to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| And that's why we got with those officers and talked to them about the classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| and what we can do through the merit council to keep them in the position to where they can still have the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| I didn't think that was fair either, and that was my biggest objection to the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| That was also mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| Now, you mentioned vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| Do these officers have vehicles now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| They have vehicles that they use to transport individuals to and from the jail from juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| They're not take-home vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| We'll have to look, those are things that we'll all have to look at and set policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| and we'll have to do it according to our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| And I assume if we're going to upgrade their vehicles, and maybe this is out of yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7289)|
| 2:01:34| is this something we're going to have to dispose of these vehicles then at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| I haven't had a chance to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| We will look at that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| We've been in negotiations since last July, and we know specifically which vehicles are going, if you'd like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7301)|
| 2:01:47| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| I'm just trying to understand what's going on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| Three Crown Vixens, Chevy Impala, 99, 03, 03, and 08 go with those officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| And the sheriff's department has said, we've gotten all that figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| They won't be on my budget anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| They'll be on his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| And then he can dispose of them and be able to use those proceeds to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| Upgrade, dispose, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| The same way we would with our other fleet vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| I just want to be able to, you know, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| You know, we've been presented this, and we've had a week to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| We've not had seven months to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| And I'm not trying to be confrontational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this so I can make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| And nor are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| We've got some reserves about some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| And the judge and I have worked those out and talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| And the one of them is just what we're talking about is the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| But everything else, once they're transferred to the Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| they'll follow under our policy and our guidelines on how we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| So, Ms. Bennett, just to be clear, it sounded like you said some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:56| individuals weren't going to be part of the uniformed officers program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| Is that what kind of drove them to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| I just want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| And so the second piece of it is, so they, within their same job, I don't mean bidding on a sheriff's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7386)|
| 2:03:14| That is part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| Are we ever going to come to a point, and I don't know who to ask this to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| to where they're going to transition into a uniformed officers program and we'll add those to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:29| In terms of that job, I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| If they were to change jobs and go into a position that falls under the uniformed officers program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| No, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| But in their current position, if it's six, and the six of them are now just in-house court people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7417)|
| 2:03:45| we'll always just have them as in-house court people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| If that individual chooses to get a promotion, that's fine, but we'll replace that with another person in that same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| And then the assets that they, the ones that transfer to the sheriff's pension program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7436)|
| 2:04:03| those assets are just frozen and they'll get whatever interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| They can continue to be invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| So they can change their money, but there will be no more dollars going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| No additional contributions will go into those accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| They won't get any more opportunities to change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| Did the sheriff kindly, I think, open up this opportunity for these 13 individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7458)|
| 2:04:24| I think this is speak now or forever hold your breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| So I want to make sure we don't want next year where two of them change their mind because they heard it was better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| So we're clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| And I'd like to also thank the judge, because we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| I mean, it kind of ran through finance on consent, and we drug them out here at the 11th hour to answer a bunch of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:47| But I do appreciate all the work that you all did to get the numbers for us because, you know, as I said in that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| we do mean the pride and we'll be prying in a whole lot more closets and canisters come budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7494)|
| 2:05:02| So thank you for providing us with those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| In the spirit of that conversation, Commissioner McKenzie, I'd like to also provide you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| we have submitted our plan of a savings of $148,996.34 to finance as of yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:21| and that does slightly exceed our 4% requested cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| You had asked about that the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| We have had one employee that's gone to halftime, eliminated one position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| and two employees that have gone from 37.5 to 30 are primarily the way that we achieved those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:39| Ms. Garrett is also going to pass out to members of the commission our annual report as far as numbers of cases we heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7539)|
| 2:05:47| And I'm very proud to report to this body that the felony referrals in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| and I share this credit with both police departments, all the probation counselors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| the referrals were down 40% last year on felonies by juveniles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| We're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| Commissioner, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| I didn't mean to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| No, no, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7570)|
| 2:06:18| How many of these officers are certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| And how many is going to come in under the UOP program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| Two more are going to the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| How are we going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| At what rank are they coming in at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| They come in at, that's part of the money that we were talking about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| to bring them up to our scale of the same individuals that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| I think it's an 18, isn't it, Allison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| Eighteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| What does someone normally start out at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| I need to get the numbers guru down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| I'm talking about what level, Allison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| Two officers will be grade 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| and the remainder will be grade 14, which is patrol officer pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| It's right at $32,399 for patrol officer pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| Well, I notice some of these people down there are sergeants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| Are any of them coming in as sergeants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| Two of them, and they're not certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| One is and one isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| That's where they fell on our scale is their current pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| We tried to put them to the closest pay on our pay scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| and they fell at grade 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| Which could also be, it's either a lieutenant in corrections or a sergeant on patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| But I would be a little bit envious if I'd been in the sheriff's department 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| and I'm not a sergeant yet, and you're hiring someone in as a sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| That would bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| That's what I was thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| I didn't know whether they were going to start in on the ground level or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| I just wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| Thank you, Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7675)|
| 2:07:56| We've heard a lot of figures today, and I'm totally in agreement with doing this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| I just want to get one thing clear for everybody, the audience and the TV audience also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7681)|
| 2:08:07| Is this a total net increase of $49,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7687)|
| 2:08:12| I know we're talking about taking your court budget, Judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| and moving it to the sheriff's department to pay these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| But is this a net $49,000 increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| Okay, that's one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| That's the most it could be with the officers that have elected $49,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| Okay, we should mention 35 a while ago and then 30, and I just want to be sure that 49 is a net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| Thirty-five plus the 13 for the retirement benefits of the ones that are exercised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Yes, I'd like to thank Judge Urban for the job he does at juvenile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| and also considering these employees, you know, a lot of people get pushed around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| but I think working with what the sheriff and Ms. Bennett and Allison has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| I think it's a great thing that these employees make a decision because you're affecting somebody's retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| They work hard to get that retirement, and I just want to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| We need to treat these people fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| I'll go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| Do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| If you'd like some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| Do you have something else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| If you'd like some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| I just wanted to reiterate my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| This has nothing to do with the performance of my officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| I have excellent officers, and they have been professional in my entire time as juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:32| There's no reflection on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| It's just not wanting to be a law enforcement officer myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| Go to the academy, they'll be even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| They'll even be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| Do we have anyone opposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| We'll take about a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to have a point of personal privilege, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7790)|
| 2:10:00| Earlier today at lunch, Doug Battelle, Parks and Rec, and Carol Evans, Legacy Parks, hosted us, commission, for lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7800)|
| 2:10:14| and I would like to say thank you for those people getting us together to talk about Parks and Rec in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:21| and I appreciate the program that they gave us and the meal that they gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| I also want to back up on the item that 701, which we passed on, it was on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:35| is a certain point to the fact of the work being done by Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7835)|
| 2:10:40| It has to do with the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| The golf course of which Commissioner Norman and I are members, and now to which other people are now new members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:54| is an example of the efforts of the good servants that we have within Knox County's government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7854)|
| 2:11:05| More particularly, I want to speak to the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| Mark Brown and Kevin Lewis are doing a terrific job inside and outside at the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7869)|
| 2:11:19| of the things that need to be done for us at the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| I also want to recognize Everett Siner, a long-time employee of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| and the things that he's done to assist those people in making the golf course the better place to play golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:36| As I've said, I'm a member of the golf board, but I'm not a golfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7896)|
| 2:11:42| The reason I'm on the golf board is I sit on commission and I'm a nearby resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| and I think that things are really going great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| The most interesting point that I want to make, though, is that through the actions of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7911)|
| 2:11:58| taking control of the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| there are dollars that have not left Knox County and gone to Texas or gone to California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| Those managing dollars that would have been profit out of the golf course have been, this is irony, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| plowed back into the course, making it a better experience for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7934)|
| 2:12:20| Having said that, I want to again say thank you for lunch and thank you for the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| Doug Patel and Carol Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| And then I would move that we take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7948)|
| 2:12:34| We need a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| On the five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| Mr. Chair, before we vote, can I ask the commission something about, well, just, you didn't announce the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7964)|
| 2:12:52| Doug, I have your Girl Scout cookies up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| You owe me $350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| And I appreciate the job you do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7977)|
| 2:13:07| On the 901, we had 17 yes, one no, and one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:15| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| I'd just like to kind of advise the commission on the handout that Judge Irvin passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8000)|
| 2:13:26| There's some personally identifiable information on these individuals that's going to be transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| So we probably don't need to leave that information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8012)|
| 2:13:37| Five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8017)|
| 2:13:45| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee to add a new section to the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:51| to require that school board districts contain voting precincts that are reasonably compact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| contiguous and overlapping or contain split voting precincts effective with the redevelopment following the 2010 federal census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8036)|

| 2:14:14| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| I'll just respond to anybody's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| This is on the voting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| This is on your voting thing, the split precincts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8074)|
