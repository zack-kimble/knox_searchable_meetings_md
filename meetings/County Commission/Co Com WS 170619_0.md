| 0:15:40| We are setting the agenda in a two-step operation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| Items to be added, deferred, or withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Then we will talk about the items to be discussed in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| Make a motion to add, defer, and withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| Motion is properly before us that these items either be added, deferred, withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| that the agenda be set, and the next motion will be to name the discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=967)|
| 0:16:17| All in favor of this motion to set the agenda, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=977)|

| 0:16:24| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Now this is the second of the two-part dance we have to do on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| Items to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=993)|

| 0:16:39| I have item 10 on page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| That's the library board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Also I have item, Mr. Law Director, do we have to read this item 65, page 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1011)|
| 0:17:01| first reading the closure of a recorded but not improved right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| We have to read that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Do we need to read it tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| We will leave that on consent for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| The only item up for discussion is item number 10, page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| Are there other items to be discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| There's a lot of DVDs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| Mr. Vandevee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| I kept waiting on you to call items to be amended, so maybe we just deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| if the item could be heard or if it could be considered at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| On Resolution 409, which is simply a rental services agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| we are still in the late stages of some negotiation with Stowers Equipment over indemnification issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| I think they're going to satisfactorily resolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| but if we could remove Stowers for this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| we'll just bring them back in a separate item next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| and continue forward with APAC, Bobcat, and Claiborne-Holling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Everything else is in good order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| I can say just a minor tweak with Stowers on indemnification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| and we weren't able to get it resolved by meeting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| So if item number 50 could be amended to remove Stowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| we could do that at the time that it's discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| or if it's procedurally correct to do it on the front end, we'll do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| We'll hold on to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| This item will be discussed this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Item number 50, Resolution 409, we will discuss this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| That's two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I would like to discuss item number 46 and number 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| No, excuse me, 46 and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1128)|

| 0:19:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Also, we had talked about having a discussion next Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| with the Metropolitan Planning Commission Executive Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| and I see that the Deputy Director is in the audience here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| with the signs and things we're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Are you prepared to do that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| or did you want to do that on next Monday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| So that would be number, I think it's 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| Number 69 will be the presentation from the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1187)|

| 0:22:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker, did you have another item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| We were discussing the new law that takes effect on July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Not tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| But we probably would be better to do it next week if we move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1355)|

| 0:22:41| Commissioner Busler, did you wish us to discuss anything this evening about road construction on Family Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| Family Road there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Yes, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| This is a discussion item of Bluebird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| Is that lane or road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| Discussion item of Bluebird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| Blueberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Blueberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Blueberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Blueberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Blueberry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| I've just received an email from the Community Alternatives to Prison Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| They work with the Sheriff's Department and are in the process of applying for a grant to secure their next year's funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| They've gotten a verbal approval from the state for their grant, but they're waiting to get the contract back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| They have not got the contract back normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| They would have submitted it to us to put on our agenda to vote at on Monday the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| So I'd like to put a placeholder on our agenda for the Community Alternatives to Prison Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| that hopefully they will get for us to review on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| I think it will be extremely difficult for something to be presented to us between now and next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| It will have to be reviewed by the legal sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| I just wanted to get on the record that they're trying to get this approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| It's been a matter of routine for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| They've received this funding year after year for many years back, so I doubt the actual contract has changed in any way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| However, it should be fairly routine, and I'll share with Connie, the director of that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| as soon as she gets the contract back, share it directly to the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| That will just have to take its normal course, and if it can be done, it will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| But if it can't beâ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| I completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| I was just sharing the email that I just received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| I think she was getting stressed out and wanted to let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Are there other items for discussion this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| If not, Madam Clerk, do you think you have a record of what we're going to be discussing this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1505)|

| 0:25:45| Madam Clerk, have you done a silent roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| The clerk has performed a silent roll call, and all members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1551)|

| 0:27:06| We're still waiting on the name to come back for sure on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1626)|

| 0:27:54| The next item is on page 4, item 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1674)|
| 0:28:05| This is authorizing the acceptance of a Tennessee Community Crime Reduction Program Small Grant Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| for the Vine Middle Magnet School in the amount of $13,415.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1691)|

| 0:28:20| Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| I'd just simply like to know what they will be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| What's it entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| What service level is going to be supported in the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| Just general information regarding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Ma'am, could I have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Yes, Laura Denton. I'm the grant manager for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| And this grant was applied for by Vine Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| and they're using the funds to do a STEM Scout program at the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| as well as some college and career visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| and it's building on their Real Talk program that they do after school currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1729)|

| 0:30:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Item number 46 is approving a contract with Rogers Group Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| for the provision of hot mix hauling, placement, sidewalks, and curbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Resolution 405.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Oh, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Yes, Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| I'd like to ask Mr. Jim Snowden to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| and answer a couple of quick questions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| I saw on the contract for Rogers Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| in comparing the 60,000 tons of hot mix asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| that they're contracted for this next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| I see on last year's contract we had a set price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| and then this year it did increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| It's taken about a 16% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| So my question is, how many county subdivision roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| have we paved so far this year or plan to do in FY17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1875)|
| 0:31:24| An estimate, Commissioner, would be probably about 25 miles of subdivision street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| I would have to look into the details specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| but I would anticipate between 20 and 25 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| of the 50 miles we've paved in this current fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| has been residential subdivision streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| And then next year, with the tremendous increase in the cost of the asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| what kind of reduction do you see in the amount of subdivision miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| that we'll be able to pave now with the cost going up so much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| You know, that number, that 75 number, is a base number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| That number can be increased or reduced based on an index that TDOT publishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| So it could be possibly that that number goes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| if the price of liquid asphalt cement goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| If not, if the number stays fairly level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| I would think probably in the neighborhood of maybe three to five miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| something like that, would be reduced potentially with the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| Okay. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=1956)|

| 0:35:41| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| Mr. Van Vate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| I'm just here to answer questions, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Somebody had it removed from consent, so I assume there would be a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| On the contract, and again, maybe this just is a housekeeping issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| I had a couple quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| It said that the period of performance is from December 5th of last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| through October 27th of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| but we entered into the contract on March of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| So the contract started, but we didn't recognize the contract until March of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| You know, Commissioner, I'd have to get somebody from Stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| probably Chris Cronjew, to come and answer it specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| but I think it has to do with federal funding cycles versus the actual contract period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| The EAC administers the AmeriCorps program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| and they observe certain periods of time for the deployment of those personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| and I'm not sure that those always marry up with the funding cycles from the U.S. government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| but it's a space I'm not terribly familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| So I can get more details from you or have Chris give you a call before Monday if you prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| And then just one other quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| I just happened to spot something on the last page of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| It says that they have access to a vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| and then they're supposed to pay for parking at $900 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Where are they parking a vehicle that's charging $95 a month to park it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| That's one I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| They typically drive our vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| and if they're parking at the city county building they wouldn't be paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| and we don't charge anybody for parking at Baxter Avenue, so I'll have to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| I wonder if that's boilerplate language out of the original contract, but I'll be glad to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2258)|

| 0:38:22| What do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Is it transporting of hazardous material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Is it educational information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| I mean, I just wasn't real sure on how to look at what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| Ma'am, could I have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Jenny Holden, 605 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| It's actually a grant for a 10-day class for HazMat team members, rural metro's HazMat team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| as well as Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| It's about 30 students, and we'll actually let some students from other counties outside of Knox County join in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| because we don't have enough to do the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| But it's just a class where they learn more about hazardous materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| how to respond in the case of a HazMat incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2335)|

| 0:39:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| I just wanted to know what this risk management item does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| What service level is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| That's what my question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| It's the broker we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| We have to have a broker in order to buy property insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| and that's the primary purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| But this broker also buys many different products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2403)|

| 0:41:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| I just wanted to know what the service level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| and the treatment of this particular resolution entailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2481)|
| 0:41:29| Is there someone from the administration that can address this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2489)|
| 0:41:37| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| Or you can bring the crew with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2507)|
| 0:41:56| Mr. Chairman, could I chime in a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Yeah, the Veterans Court and Treatment Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| it's specifically set up just like the Drug Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| but it's for the veterans and it's something that it's more intense treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| and it helps try to cut down on recidivism rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| So it's just the money is for case management and treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| and facilitation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Well, if anybody wants to look, it's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| If you go into there, the contract is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| and it just defines all the services they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| No, sir, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2555)|

| 0:42:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2558)|

| 0:42:42| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| This is resolution 904 that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| Resolution approving a memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2571)|

| 0:43:00| for the purpose of establishing a new cooperative research effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| to examine the juvenile justice policies in Tennessee, resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| Okay, this is item 67,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| and it's a discussion of expenses related to storm damage at the cove at Concord Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2626)|
| 0:44:00| I just want to go over a few things so you all would be aware of what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| and why there's not a resolution on the agenda to appropriate funds for this cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| Of course, Parks and Rec and Procurement, we issued an emergency PO to expedite the cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| and get all that completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| What we did is we are fairly certain that we'll be awarded a FEMA grant for this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| for the damage at the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| And so in doing so, we set up a new work code in our, what we call Fund 102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| which is our grant fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| And so what we do is that's a non-budgeted fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| And so set up the work code there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| We will charge all the expenses there, keep track of everything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| If, in fact, we do get the FEMA grant, then we will bring that to commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| They're usually a 12.5% state match, a 12.5% local match on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| And we'll bring that at that time and go through that whole process of documenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| and turning in and getting reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| If we do not get a FEMA grant, then we do have some excess funds in our grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| our federal and state grant fund 102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| from where we have appropriated local grant matches over the course of many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| It has built up in that fund balance, and we can use that funding to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| That's what we'll use for our grant match for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| And if something happens that we do not get awarded a FEMA grant, then we'll use that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2734)|
| 0:45:45| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Chris, there's been some talk at the federal level about FEMA going to a deductible program format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| That hasn't went through the Fed yet, has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| So we're still on the same system we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| What's the time frame for finding out if we've been declared a disaster area and funds are available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| I don't know the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| I know that they've had some conversations with Doug Battelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| and they think that we're going to hit that threshold locally and as a state as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| And so then from that standpoint, that's when they started telling us what's allowable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| and putting an estimate on the table and getting to us a document to start that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| We went through this experience with FEMA back in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| There's a group of people right back there that are probably in excellent resources for Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| to help guide them through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| It is a tedious process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Mr. Caldwell, did the final bill just for the tree removal and branches and all that just hit just above $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2810)|
| 0:47:01| Lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Lower, $95,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| So it did come in under $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Okay, that's great because the original estimate was much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| I would just like to give hats off to Doug for getting this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| This is one of our most visited parks opened back up to the public so fastly, so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| That is important this time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| If this would have happened in fall, dead of winter, but the timing that it happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| the speed at which this was done was very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| Yeah, and I certainly can't take the credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| I think between our park staff, Ministry of Tree Service, and LCUB did just a knockout job, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| getting the park cleaned up and back up with electric service, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| And then, Doug, didn't LCUB do some additional things where they now put the power lines underground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2876)|
| 0:48:04| So if we ever have another incident like this again, we won't be without power then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| They were very generous both with their time and effort on that for us as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| because obviously with a lot of trees gone, the utility poles would have looked much worse out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| So everything is underground now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Our staff is going to run all the secondary, which they're out there working on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| And so it will look much better and be much safer in the future as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| And, again, you did mention the contractor's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| but do you want to tell them that they basically worked from dawn until dusk and until Saturdays and Sundays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| Yeah, they did an incredible job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| They projected, I think, a 10-day turnaround, which I was going to be amazed if they met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| And I think in reality they were out of there in about five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| So they did an incredible job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| I think they poured their entire company in there to get it done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Tell them how much equipment was actually brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Oh, gosh, the day I was there, I think they had probably 25 or 30 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| and probably 20 pieces of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| So they did an incredible job for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| And do you mind mentioning their name one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Yeah, Menstruous Tree Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| They should be commended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| They really did an awesome job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Thank you, Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| Madam Clerk, next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| Number 69 is a report from the Executive Director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| regarding the MPC administrative rule change for discontinuing the posting of public meeting signs by MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2966)|
| 0:49:34| explanation of the new policy regarding the applicant assuming the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| of posting the MPC public notice sign on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2978)|
| 0:49:46| Mr. Schoonmaker, did you wish to give background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| I'm sure Mr. Kelly would be able to fill everyone in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| but they just did an administrative rule change where the MPC staff previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| has posted the little metal signs that were the black and white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| and now they've gone to a new procedure where Mr. Kelly will be able to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| who's going to handle the signs from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Dan Kelly, MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| And Menstruous Tree Service did cut a tree down for me, too, recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| That's why he's building a new house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| The signs that I have out here are just a few of the ones that we're proposing to start placing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| as opposed to the black signs that you've been seeing for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| The reason that we're changing from staff posting the signs to the applicant posting the signs is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| there's a cost, of course, involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| We're estimating that it costs approximately $2,000 a month to place signs right now with the labor cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| The cost of the existing signs that we have, they're pretty expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| They get lost, they get stolen, they get vandalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| Vehicle costs are associated with putting the signs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| In addition to that, we have a staff person doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| so by pulling them back into the office, we lose a little bit of liability there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| in that they're not standing out next to the right-of-way trying to put a sign out with vehicles going by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3084)|
| 0:51:35| Historically, we had one fellow that did it for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| He retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| We had another fellow that started doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| He had health problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| The number of people that we have on the staff left now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| the cost just keeps going up because of the level at which they are currently getting paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| and they would be much better off being in the office doing work that they're trained to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| as opposed to putting these signs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| One of the things that I would like to remind you is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| the signs are just one element of the public notice process that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| The signs, of course, are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| We publish our agenda now online approximately 30 days before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| The agenda is published online before the signs ever go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| and most people in most community organizations now know to go to the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| and take a look at our website and identify the matters that are going to be coming up on the MPC agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| In addition to that, the legal requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| and the only legal requirement for public notice is the one that we publish in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| So, therefore, you have newspaper, online, and the signs all being used to put out public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3166)|
| 0:52:55| regarding the matters that are going to be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3175)|
| 0:53:06| I think when the applicant comes in and makes an application for one of these type of applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3186)|
| 0:53:14| they will be given this sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| There is a stand that goes with it that they will post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| They are given instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| They sign an agreement stating that they're going to post that sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| and there is a statement in there that if the sign doesn't get posted in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| then the matter can, and the Planning Commission has said can and will be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| That doesn't necessarily mean that if a sign gets posted and then gets stolen that they'll be postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3221)|
| 0:53:49| but if we know that the sign never got out, they will be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| We intend, and we go out and look at the sites and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| One of the things that we have found, and we started putting these signs out for the July meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| as soon as they came in and made an application, a lot of them went out and just stuck the sign up that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| or within a day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| You're probably actually going to get more time on the ground with these signs than you would with our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| because we put them out about 15 days before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| I believe that covers what I have to say about it, but I think the color code in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| it makes it easier for us, really, than anybody else because invariably somebody would call in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| I saw a rezoning sign out on Bagley Road, and I want to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| You start looking through the agenda for rezoning on Bagley Road, and there isn't one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| It turns out it's a USAR review or something else, and everybody's going, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| We believe that people call in and go, I saw an orange sign, I saw a red sign, I saw a yellow sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| At that point, we'll know what they're talking about, and it makes it easier on us to be able to answer questions more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3301)|
| 0:55:11| and we don't stammer around going, I don't know anything about rezoning out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| Hopefully we'll be able to provide better service to the community doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| On the line, on the rezoning, does the applicant put, for instance, R1 to R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| No, we're going to put the file number on there. The MPC file number will go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| And the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| As of right now, we're not putting a date because the reason being a number of items get postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| so from that standpoint, they have the option at that point, if there's a date on there, then there would have to be another sign posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| So right now we're thinking that the postponement, you know, if we get the sign out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| if people are interested, they'll do one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| They'll call 215-2500, or they'll go to the website at noxmpc.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| Well, there's a couple of signs on Hardin Valley Road, and for about four days I've seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| And I'm not aware of the cutter coding, so I'm not exactly sure what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| When you're going by at a certain speed, you can't read it, you know, unless you're used to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| Those old signs were horrible because they were just taped together, but boy, you could sure read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| You know, they were big metal signs when they stood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| These are the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Dan, is there going to be a cost savings associated with this that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| The cost savings, one, is that the people that are doing it will actually be in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| We have two planners that are doing it right now, and there are work program items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| such as the John Sevier Highway Corridor Study that, you know, there's things that they could be working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| that would be much more beneficial than putting up a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| And we don't want to have to hire somebody to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| You know, it's just there's not enough work for somebody to do this kind of thing on a full-time basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3443)|
| 0:57:31| but at the same time, it is time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| I've already seen the yellow subdivision sign on Corner Tipton Station and Highway 33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| which is, I like the sign because I don't know what's going on with the different colors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| but are we still mailing out notices every 300 feet or 300 yards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| That's correct. I left that out, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| So they will, is it 300 yards or 300 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Okay, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| It's actually 250 feet, but I'd be surprised how many people that catches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| Oh, yeah, and it's a lot, and it does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| Me being an anti-litter guy, that sign's a litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| Who's required to pick that sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| We have added to the instructions as to when they are required to be picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3497)|
| 0:58:26| There is no way, I mean, if we're out, staff being out, and we do go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3506)|
| 0:58:36| We visit every site every month, and we're out about all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| If we see a sign that we know that's already come and gone, we'll pull it up and take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| But otherwise, we believe that, we hope that the applicant will take the thing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| They're going to be instructed to take it down anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Well, I hope they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| I'll go by tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| The one that was put out on Maryville Park and Tipton Station, Knox County came through in mode this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| I've got a feeling it's chopped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| So, you know, I'm an anti-litter guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| So, in any luck against Knox County, they did a great job mowing up the road this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Kind of along the lines of Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| I do like the new colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| I mean, they're more explanatory, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| But the question I have is you've stated two things, I think, that you may not have looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| You stated that it was costly to put to fund, you know, $2,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| You know, that could be a part-time temporary job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| I mean, that doesn't have to be a benefited job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| It could be 10 hours a week, and it doesn't have to be $2,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| For a retiree, that's a pretty good little gig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| Number two, you said you visited the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| You visit every site, so why couldn't you put a sign there when you visit every site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| If you're already going there, if you don't want to get your boots dirty, don't work at NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| The timing for when we're out visiting the sites versus when the signs have gone out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| the old signs had, you know, stuff that had to be scraped off, had to have new letters put on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| the dates, everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| There was a process, you know, involved in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| So from that standpoint, it had always fallen to one individual to make the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| and then the planning staff that's reviewing the actual zoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| and going to be writing the recommendation, they're the ones that are out driving by or being by the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3634)|
| 1:00:43| I mean, you could buy a label maker and print that zoning agenda item number right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| and place it on that sign and take it right out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| And really, I think nine times out of ten, this is going to be perfect and it's going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| but you're going to get that controversial rezoning where somebody says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| I didn't see a sign, and, well, it's not up to us to put the sign up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| then why have a sign out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| I mean, I know everybody sits and reads all the legal notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| when NBC publishes them in the paper and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| I mean, I know they're all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| We have suggested to the applicants that everybody has a smart phone now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| everybody has a camera in that phone, so we have suggested that they take a picture of that sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| and we've actually even gone as far as to suggest that they go ahead and e-mail it in to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| when they get the sign posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| I'm just saying, there's going to be a time where this sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| and I know they're placed by staff and taken out by other people in the previous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| but when we take it off the responsibility of the NPC to notify the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| and I think this is one of the ways we notify the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| I think this policy is going to come back and bite you guys on the controversial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| and I hope that you consider maybe hiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| It doesn't have to be a full-time employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| It can be $10 an hour or somebody comes in and just does it one day a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| I mean, I think there's a lot of issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| I'll pass that along to Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| The idea of the applicant placing the sign is not Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| will not be the only city that does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| This is a fairly standard practice that the applicants post their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| I don't doubt, and, you know, to a certain degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| we believe that if an applicant knows that their matter is in jeopardy of being postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3745)|
| 1:02:33| if the sign's not there, they may have a more vested feeling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3753)|
| 1:02:41| or they may feel that I need to make sure that that sign's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| because if they don't, they're going to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| Whereas we go out and post a sign, some kid comes along and picks it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| or uses it for target practice or whatever, and they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| And the only thing that the community says, they show up at the Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| and they go, well, I never saw the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| And they start looking around and go, well, we posted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| At that point, the Planning Commission goes, we're going to hear the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| I do like the design and the colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| I mean, it makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| I think there's going to be a time where somebody says they're never going to post that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| But if you're out there and you see that, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| The Planning Commission can deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| There are 15 citizens that are appointed by our mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| and they will sit there and listen to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| and if they believe the sign did not get posted, I guarantee you they'll postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Dan, what kind of stand goes with that sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| It's the metal frame that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| Many of you, I think, probably have used this type of sign in the past during your elections and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| You're aware if it goes a week without rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| I wonder what kind of deal you all got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| Those things are really, really hard to post in certain areas when you've had dry conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| or a right-of-way that's very rocky, which a lot of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| How many of these signs will we be producing and handing out a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| Per year, I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| There are some months that there will be close to 100 signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| And there is no requirement that they be turned back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| No, there is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| So they're all going to wind up in a landfill, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| And the frames also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| Well, the old signs are either ending up in a ditch or the frames are bent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3890)|
| 1:04:59| They're the realtor type signs with a heavier frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| The frames get bent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| The signs get mutilated from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| What's the average length of time the sign will have to be up right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| 14, 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| That's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Do you think they'll hold up to a good, strong storm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| That they'll still be standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| If one does go missing, what's the process for the applicant to replace it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| They have to come get another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| They have to come get another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| I like the color coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| I think that's a really good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| I do kind of fear that there is going to be questions of if the sign is posted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| It's going to be a lot more controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| because people will claim it hasn't or the applicant won't post it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| whereas before we had control of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| And I know that notification, as you said, is legally done through the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3951)|
| 1:05:58| And there are certain homeowners associations that do check every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| But I think, in all honesty, you could say 75%, 80% of people are aware of any zoning issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| or user reviews from a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| I'm with Brad on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| I just hope that this doesn't become an issue where we get to a lot of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| and we get things postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| We're not going to throw the old signs away at this point anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| And, you know, let's give it a whirl and see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| If it turns out to be more trouble than it's worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| then I think Commissioner Anders identified a potential alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| But we're trying to make use of the personnel that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4002)|
| 1:06:49| in the best way that we believe that we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| I mean, and you wouldn't necessarily even have to hire somebody part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| You could probably do this on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| You know, there are ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| But, you know, when the guy's standing there in front of you and you've got the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| you go, here, it's your responsibility to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| And they sign a piece of paper and say they'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| You know, I believe the majority of the people that we deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| and, you know, most of the people that we deal with doing this stuff, they're repeaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| You know, the development community in Knoxville is relatively small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| And so, therefore, I think we have faith in the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| most of the people that we deal with that will do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| What are the guidelines and policies that you will hand out to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| when they come and fill out an application for placement of these signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| I didn't bring that with me, but we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| I mean, they can't have a 20-acre parcel of land and go stick it in the middle of it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| It says it has to be posted, you know, in proximity to the right-of-way in a highly visible area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| And there may be even situations where we may end up giving people two signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| depending on how big the property is, how it's situated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| And we can tell them, basically, we want the sign put right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| So MPC is of the opinion, I guess from the conversation we just had, that we can try this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4099)|
| 1:08:26| You know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| And if it works, we'll stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| If there are problems, you are flexible to making changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| You know, this is, you know, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| We talked with the Planning Commission before we started doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| You know, this wasn't something that we just sprung on somebody saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| Here, we're going to, we're changing today, and you all can take it or leave it, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| We did talk with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| That's who we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| The staff received guidance from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| The signs are a requirement of their administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| And so from that standpoint, how the signs are posted, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4143)|
| 1:09:10| is more or less under the purview of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| So that's who we went to first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| So you all had open discussions and meetings about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| We had an open discussion at the MPC agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| which, you know, it's very similar to this meeting right here in relation to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| that's where we discuss matters with the commission that we know that are going to be controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| for the upcoming meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| And then plans are discussed, you know, their work program, budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| things like that are discussed at the agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Since the signs will not have a date and time in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| do you anticipate a higher amount of calls that you all will actually have to handle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| We've been getting calls, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| You think more so than before when the signs actually had the date on it and time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| Probably because they're being out so far, they've been out longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| They put them out the day they make the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| The deadline for making an application is 45 days before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| and the signs are going out sometime that week as opposed to 15 days prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| You know, people just take them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| They want to get that responsibility over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Take it out and put them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| So we've been getting calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| And you are going to do spot checks to make sure that the weather or whatever doesn't knock the signs over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Well, we'll be out, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| And if they put them out like that, if they run right out the door and put them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| I guarantee you we'll know whether they're there or not when we go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| because we don't go out to look at the matters until probably about 30 days before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4246)|
| 1:10:54| How many stands are you going to give them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Because I know whenever I'm out putting up a campaign sign, I would hit something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| and by the time you bend that thing back and forth a few times trying to get it to go in the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| you wind up with a broke sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Well, you know, I'm sure you folks have more experience with these frames than a good number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| so I will defer to your concerns on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| I understand because, you know, I've been out putting signs out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| and the signs that we have, when it gets real dry, they can be difficult to put in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| I would say 80% of the people you deal with will put up the signs where it could be seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| so that people can have a voice in what's going on around their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| But there are occasions where you have a controversial issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| that shouldn't be zoned a certain way in a certain area where you need a sector plan amendment also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4313)|
| 1:12:01| That's what I'm worried about for getting up here in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| and somebody comes up and says, I didn't see a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| The only time I saw it was about two days ago before it was to be taken up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| or however length of time, you said 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| And I've seen people, a sign go up, and two or three days later on a controversial piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4335)|
| 1:12:23| that the sign goes down in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| And then I go looking for what's happening, and then all of a sudden about five or six days later it appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| It's only on the controversial issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| And I don't want to create a situation to where we're judging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| where somebody is telling the truth or not telling the truth, saying that there was no sign up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| And that's going to be on those issues, not the legitimate developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| but some of these others that's trying to get something through to finagle the system a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| to get something in their area that shouldn't be in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| And that's my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| I don't want that issue that we're going to set up here and just kind of be like judge and jury over somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4386)|
| 1:13:16| And I think that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| And you're talking about the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| I like the color signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| And I like the issue where you're not putting a date or time on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| but a phone number to call and say, hey, there's an orange sign or a yellow sign up or a white sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| What's going on if they're calling to find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| But that other issue bothers me that we may have to make a judgment call up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| on something we shouldn't be making a judgment call on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| And I just wish there was more oversight to make sure the signs were up in a reasonable time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| so people could see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| And some people I don't trust, but most of the people I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| So, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| A couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| When Commissioner Andrews mentioned $10 an hour, Commissioner Brantley about jumped out of his shoes as a retiree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| That might be a potential job for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| You know, you can also think about charging $10 a deposit if they bring the sign back when it's hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| That helps pay for this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Is the applicant, and I do like the idea you said about taking a picture of it and then emailing it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| That would be easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| When you go by, because you said you're still going to go by, and it's not there, do you put one up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| We probably notify the applicant that we went by and told them your sign's not up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| What's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| You know, they're the ones that said they'd do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| I think we ought to give them the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| If there's an issue, if they say, we put one up, whatever, I think we'd work with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| But if they hadn't put it up, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| It seems like to me if it's supposed to be up and you went by and it's just been up for two weeks and it's not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| you might go ahead and put one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| Yeah, charge it and put it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| Is he responsible to check it every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Is that in the wording at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| So he puts it up once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| That's all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| Like most of us, I agree with the new color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Designations for the different uses are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| I think I agree with Commissioner Brantley that one of the things that I think people realized when they saw the other sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4544)|
| 1:15:52| it said the date and the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| And, of course, the next MPC meeting is not until July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| But I've seen the orange signs in my district have been up for probably two weeks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| And then the other thing that you need to be aware of is a lot of times the citizens confuse the name Commissioner from the MPC Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4567)|
| 1:16:16| So we're getting a lot of e-mails and phone calls two days before the meeting because they want us to vote yes or no for something that's in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4576)|
| 1:16:27| The other thing is I said there's a couple of signs for rezoning and sector plan in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4587)|
| 1:16:34| I had some citizens call me on Friday from Commissioner Anders' district where the signs went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4594)|
| 1:16:41| The citizen told their neighbor the neighbor went out to go see the signs and now the signs are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| And they wanted to know what the policy was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| So I told them to call the MPC office to find out what is the policy when a sign is up and then it's gone the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4609)|
| 1:16:58| So have you a written policy on how that's going to be handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| Do you notify the applicant that the sign has now disappeared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| That's in the instruction statement that we have that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| Do you know if the signs on Coward Mill Road have been replaced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Do you plan because not only do commissioners get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| They may have taken them up because they put them out way too early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| And they go, hey, if I don't have to have them up, I'm taking them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| And they may appear around 15 days from the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| Somebody may have actually read what they signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| The other thing is not only do commissioners get a lot of phone calls about MPC items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| but there's a possibility that our constituent services staff could be getting phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| Is someone from your office going to get with that staff to explain the new signs in case they get phone calls about these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| the new transition, so they're aware and they can answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| We can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| In the city, we have made this same presentation at city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| and their office of neighborhoods is aware of it and has published information to the various community organizations that they deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4690)|
| 1:18:21| I think it would be a good idea to let Knox County's constituent services staff know what's going on so they're prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| And anybody else in the mayor's office that needs to know that possibly is answering the phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4708)|
| 1:18:37| We'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Commissioner Gill, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| My question was answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| You indicated that there are different colors for variances, use on review, your concept plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4723)|
| 1:18:52| and these are your three samples that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| There are other signs, and there are two or three other colors, but these are just the ones I brought down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4735)|
| 1:19:07| Could you write, because I want to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4747)|
| 1:19:15| So the bottom part of it says the same on all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| Same thing on all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| And we have also been posting signs for the city board of zoning appeals, and they will be self-posting also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4762)|
| 1:19:32| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Dan, is the application or these qualifications online, or can you email us a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| I can certainly email it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| Very briefly, I really like Bob's suggestion about the deposit that would cut down on the litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| because if there was some value to the sign and you brought it back, you'd get to reuse it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| And that's what we're all about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| I don't know if it would be a trick to reuse them, because we are writing in very bold letters there what the file number is with a permanent marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4803)|
| 1:20:15| But I have written that down as one of the suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4815)|
| 1:20:26| That's kind of what we're getting away from with the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| The main reason I wanted to put this on the agenda was so that all of us were aware of what's coming down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| because we do get so many phone calls from citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| I did also want to say part of the reason I put it on the agenda was there was a great article that was written in the Knoxville Focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| bringing it to the public's attention regarding the new signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| And, you know, hopefully maybe now one of the other publications will do a story on the new signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| so the public is more informed as far as what's going on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| The only, I guess, closing would be that, as I said earlier, there are a number of communities that require posting by the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4866)|
| 1:21:16| It works in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| I don't know why it wouldn't work in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| As I said, we're not going to throw the old signs away if this turns out to be a complete fiasco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| We are buying signs in limited numbers, so we're not going to be stuck with $5,000 worth of signs that we have to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4888)|
| 1:21:40| We're buying these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| We're getting a pretty good price on them, and we're using a local vendor to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4902)|
| 1:21:50| We can cut that off at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| Seeing no further discussion on this item, moving on, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| Discussion of Blueberry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| To open that particular discussion, Commissioner Busler was away on vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4924)|
| 1:22:13| and a certain item was referred to my staff as she exercised at Tenova Health and Fitness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4933)|
| 1:22:21| Concerning traffic flow on Emory Road near the new Kroger's and Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4941)|
| 1:22:30| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| I have been out there and talked to a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| Now, if you look at Emory Road, half of Emory Road is in the city and the other half is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4957)|
| 1:22:45| The problem that is causing the issue is in the city side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| They forced the traffic coming out of Kroger next to the gas station there to go right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| You cannot go left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| And it's right in front of Blueberry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| They put up some little markers or standards there that makes people out of Blueberry have to stay in a certain lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| and kind of a quick turn there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Where it should have come out as is at the red light that's about 500 feet west of the first exit out of the Kroger parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=4990)|
| 1:23:22| And there should have been a road put in there to where you could access Blueberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| with a red light there to where they could turn left as you're going east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| so that people could get to their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| It makes it very difficult to make a left-hand turn up at Blueberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| I don't know if we need a traffic light there or not, but the traffic flow that they designed is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| And there's been a few little fender benders out there because of that issue of how you force the traffic to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5027)|
| 1:23:57| And if you say, well, we put up signs that makes them turn the right way to help take care of that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| I'll give you another example of how people don't read signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| If you go to the Chick-fil-A and you're coming west, it has a do not turn left in the Chick-fil-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5050)|
| 1:24:17| You've got to go down to the red light and turn, but there's still people turning back through there and getting hit, turning across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| So it's not designed properly on the city side to make the traffic flow in and out of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5063)|
| 1:24:32| So I don't know how we operate. If we put another red light, we're going to have more traffic problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| And when you put up a red light, I think you have more rear-end wrecks where somebody runs into the back of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5076)|
| 1:24:44| So I don't know about the safety issue. I don't know what can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| But half of it is the city's problem, how they design the exit from the Kroger Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| Commissioner Anders, if you'll pause with me just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| because I think what I'm willing to do is put Commissioner Bussler and myself in the same basket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5099)|
| 1:25:06| We're not traffic engineers. And I'm going to call on Mr. Van de Vee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| Mr. Van de Vee, did you come forward to make a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| because there's a rather lengthy letter out about what might be the possible solutions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5114)|
| 1:25:22| I can, Commissioner, if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Probably the most useful thing I can do is let Jim and Cindy speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| because they are traffic engineers and they have been hard at work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| Let me just say that what we are trying as diligently as possible to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| is to avoid any circumstance under which the west side of Emory Road looks like the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| In order to do so, we are in a position of having occasionally to say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| or having to support the state when they say no to entrance requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| that are coming in and trying to promote the use of shared entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| The other thing we're trying to do is to promote as much traffic to come on backage roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| or through joint easements on the back of those parcels at Front Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| in order to keep traffic moving out at the signalized intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| If you'll permit me, I'd like to let Cindy speak to this for just a minute or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| but just remember that our overriding goal is to keep the west side of Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| from looking like the east side of Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| It's vitally important. I live out there. I see it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| Volumes are up immensely with the new Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| There's a dental office going in. There is a credit union going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| There is a Wild Wings Cafe going in, and there is property yet to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5194)|
| 1:26:42| Aubrey's is under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Things are happening out there fast and furious, and if we're not careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| and we don't make the best possible decisions that we can right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| it will be difficult for us to correct later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| So I'm assuming Cindy's still here. There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| And that is the award-winning Cindy Bianchi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| So in regards to Blueberry's access, when the Kroger site came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5224)|
| 1:27:11| it was a joint traffic impact study was done that was reviewed by TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| Knox County, MPC, and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| At the time, the decisions were made in regards to the Kroger development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| that a traffic signal was needed for the development that was going to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| on the southwest side of the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| And the best location for the traffic signal was basically midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| between the southbound ramps from I-75 to the traffic signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| at the intersection of High School and Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| And that's High School slash Central Avenue Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| depending on which side of the Emory Road you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| So that's how that one got there, and there would be enough traffic generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| to warrant the signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| At the time, we were aware that the Yow property was on the north side of Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| and they were in the process of developing their site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| At this point, they still have an approved plat for what they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| but they have not done any of the construction yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| As Dwight mentioned, there is a lot of development that's wanting to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| on the north side of Emory Road between the southbound ramps and Central Avenue Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| We have a lot of different property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| and they're all trying to develop their parcels, as Dwight said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| There's the Wild Wings, and there's a dental office and other things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| What we have been trying to do as each of the site plans come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| we've been putting them on the KGIS system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| and sharing with the applicant that we are hoping to get some type of what we're calling a backage road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| because these are all private properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| and we're trying to get them to share access easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| so that they can all have access to the traffic signal that is currently at the Kroger location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| and that's what we're trying to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| For the folks who live on Blueberry, nothing has really changed for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| in terms of when they come down to Emory Road and they want to go towards the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| that's still the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| They still have to look left, still have to look right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Most people, when they enter a multi-lane facility, do it as a two-step maneuver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5363)|
| 1:29:29| They pull out from the roadway that they're on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| and then they go to the center two-way left turn lane and stop and pause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| and then they pull out into the through traffic that they're joining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| and that is still possible to do at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| I know one of the emails I read was complaining about the speeds on Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| and unfortunately there's nothing that the engineering department can do about the speeds on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| I can tell you that prior to the Kroger site going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| I know when we looked at crashes at Blueberry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| it was not a crash location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| We can go back and look at that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| but at this point we're not aware of anything really changing in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| On the south side of Emory Road opposite Blueberry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| it is a right in, right out only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| because we did not want to have people crossing the through movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| from the gas station onto Blueberry and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| We felt that was too dangerous in light of the proximity to the interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| and that is why everybody was in agreement that reviewed the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| that that needed to be a right in and right out only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Blueberry itself at the time of the study did not generate enough traffic for a traffic signal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| so that's why there's not one there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| Thank you, ma'am. Commissioner Anders is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| Cindy, and I guess this is more of a policy question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| We were talking about this before the storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| There's a couple of developers up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| It's kind of the county wants to build a road or have access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| but they don't want to compensate for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| and that's kind of having the backage road and requiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| That's the taking of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| We're letting them know that it not only helps everybody on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| What we're trying to avoid is the east side of I-75 and Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| where the Ingalls Shopping Center is and all that strips shopping over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| because they have serious problems, crash problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| and we're trying to avoid that, and we want to get that fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| We're trying to avoid that on our side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| but unfortunately we don't have anything in the regulations that forced us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| or allowed us to ask them to dedicate a road on the Yale property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| It's something that TDOT is thinking about as part of their access policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| but at this point no such avenue is available to us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| But it's got to be a win-win for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Take the safety out of it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| It's got to be a win-win for them to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| and I don't think that we're even making it remotely a win-win for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| I know it's access to their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| but I think that TDOT and the county would lose in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| We've already lost one deal, a building deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| that I'm aware of out there because of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| And so I think we'd lose that in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| I think they don't have any other access to Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| other than what we told them no on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| Well, the property that was going to be developed that went away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| wanted an additional driveway onto Emory Road in a very short proximity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5561)|
| 1:32:48| both from the existing signal and right on top of another driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| that was already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| and they already had access to the traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| There's not access on that side yet to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| To the Yow property there is a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| I'm talking about another piece of property that was two lots down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| The dental office, they do not have an approved permit yet through TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| for their entrance onto Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| And so therein lies our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| But we're not, as a county, we're not making an attempt to be a partner in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| We're telling them we're taking their property and they're building us a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| At this point it's not really even a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| We're actually not even asking that the roadway be a continuous length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| that there's like jogs in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| because we don't really want to increase the speeds back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| We would like people to be able to go from one shop to another shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| without having to get back out onto Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| I think it's a great idea, but I don't think that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| It's coercion is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| You're not going to build your building if you don't give us this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| We pulled all of the folks that we had active site plans turned into our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5642)|
| 1:34:11| We had a meeting out at TDOT Region 1 just to share with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| and everybody got a map of what we were trying to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| just to let them know this is what we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| but we can only make this work if you're willing to work with us to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| And at this point I'm not aware that we've made any advances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| in terms of anybody doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| The only one I know for sure was the one that dropped out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| that was looking for two access points onto Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| What are we offering as incentive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| There isn't one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| That goes back to my first point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| It's just a more matter of safety for the people that want to go to those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| and have access to a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| I think it increases everything over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| You do the back road like it's proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| but if we're not a partner in it, we're taking of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| And I think the law department would be uncomfortable with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5706)|
| 1:35:13| having that coercion discussion because that's essentially what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| You can't build if you're not going to build on your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| that you have access to this road unless you build this back road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| We're not saying that they can't build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| They just don't have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| Well, they're limited to how much access they can have onto Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| The state has recently changed their access guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| and they've gotten much more strict in regards to how many they're permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| and for what distances that need to be achieved between driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| And they're the controlling factor in what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| I think we need to come in as a partner, not an adversary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| and I think that's where our problem is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| I was on the MPC and some other plannings that they were looking when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| said that Emory Road was a two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| And you talk about the east side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| There is an excess road that goes from Conner Road, Red Light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| all the way across the property back behind the bank to the next Red Light down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| There was not supposed to be any really curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| You were supposed to go to Conner Road, take a right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| and do the excess road to Ingalls and Pilot and, I guess, Kenjo Market on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5784)|
| 1:36:33| There was a little strip behind McDonald's and CVS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| That was supposed to be an excess road for them to exit out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| and go to Conner Road to the Red Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| And somewhere along the way, no matter what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| the state has control over that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| and they granted access to the two service stations on that right side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| as you get off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| And on the other side, to the Starbucks and all like that and to McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| Even if we do all that planning, what kind of assurance do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| if we get those excess roads behind which we already have in Ingalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| that goes all the way down, that they won't grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| the state won't grant access to the state highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| I mean, we can do all that planning and make all that work what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| and then it doesn't work like it was supposed to have been worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| So, I mean, how can we get assurances from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| say, okay, if we go do this, that you won't do those excesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| or grants from the state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Well, back when the east side of the interchange was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| things were very different in TDOT in terms of how they bonded improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| how many access points they granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| It was a totally different set of people in everything that we were dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| Things have definitely changed at TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| and they're much more access management oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| and they have totally changed their access control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| They have actually developed an access control policy manual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| that they are now implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| Okay. On that east side, too, you could do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| where you could access the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| but exit where you have to go back and use the red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| That could be done, but nobody's ever addressed that problem on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| But I'm just saying if you've got the right power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| you can get access to any place on the state road, what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| So I'm not sure how we address that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| If we're going to spend that money, if we're going to try to make it more valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| how do we say, okay, this is how you have to access the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| and you'll have some property owners say, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| I've already got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| If you go out there and look at the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| you can see where they've already got places for driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| And those were driveways that were out there originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| before they did the road widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| So they put them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| I think to answer what Commissioner Anders was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| we're not talking about a road, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| And I think in most cases we're talking about interconnected parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| where they tie in with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| They may lose a few parking spaces that they might be able to have otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| but it's more of an interconnected parking lots along the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| And the benefit that they get is they get access to a traffic lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| And those of you, I'm sure, remember what Cedar Bluff Road looked like 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5985)|
| 1:39:53| or 25 years ago when every business down there had their own driveway out to Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| And they ended up costing the state $20 million to try to fix what was going on down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=5999)|
| 1:40:07| And you have that same potential out at Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| Well, I think when we're talking about a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| we're talking about connecting that with Blueberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| to bring Blueberry to where they can come to the red lot and turn left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| And so when you're tellingâ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| They could actually pull into the property's parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| and work their way over to the traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| That's a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| I mean, but it would not actually be built to a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| It would be a parking lot connection like Dan was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| I mean, I get the whole concept, but if we're going to require that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| I think we need to have skin in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Partner with them instead of being adversaries with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| We're turning down millions of dollars of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| because we don't want to be a partner, and I think that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170619?start=6047)|
