| 0:00:57| Thank you for using your microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| That is my constant admonition to you all to please use your microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=58)|
| 0:01:03| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Obviously, the purpose of this meeting is for the reorganization of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| The floor is now open for nominations for chairman of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| And I'm going to ask Kim to start in the roll call nominations in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=77)|
| 0:01:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Oh, you had to nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Oh, I'd like to nominate Thomas E. Tank Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=88)|
| 0:01:36| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| The other night, Mr. Arnett, can I take a second here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| That's my nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| The other night, and I'm just thinking last night about the proceedings for the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| and how this process really goes very fast usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| And I remember the other night when we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| and I have nothing against breastfeeding in speed homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| but we had two hours of discussion on breastfeeding in speed homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=136)|
| 0:02:23| And this is a very important position, very important position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| And somehow I just wanted to encourage possibly some reflection by my colleagues on this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=148)|
| 0:02:38| and in this process rather than just names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| and glowing comments about the person they're nominating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| But I don't know whether that will happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| but certainly I'd like to see that happen, a little bit of discussion in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| So we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| That's my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| My nomination is the same as last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| And my reasoning is similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| Last year, for those of you that were here, I nominated Richard Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| And my reasoning was that I just consider he joined us on this board at a very tumultuous time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| He did so for honorable reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| When we interviewed him, we heard his credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| And I thought, you've made a big mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| You've confused Knox County Commission with the U.S. Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| So I consider him, in viewing him and watching him work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| and his preparation for issues, I consider him exemplary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| and would be a fine leader of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| And for that reason, I nominate Richard Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Commissioner Ivan Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Commissioner Schalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| I'm going to take just a moment to say a few words also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| And I really appreciate the kind things that Commissioner Norman just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| And I just respect him, as I do many, as I do all the members of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| for the work that he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| And he's one of the most honorable men that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| Also, I'd like to make a comment about Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| And I tell you, if I had my way, we would be naming one of the buildings down here after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| I think that he has done so much to restore the honor and the respect of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| that we were lacking after the events of Black Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| that really continued for some time after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| And I think this county owes a great deal of gratitude for him for all the work he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| And there's really nothing that we can do, I don't think, to honor him in the way that he's conducted these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=305)|
| 0:05:17| And I really feel that has restored the honor to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| That said, there's three members of this commission that have been here for eight years that have gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=321)|
| 0:05:31| the travails that those of us who are newer to this commission cannot even imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| And those three people are Tank Strickland, Ivan Harmon, and Craig Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=336)|
| 0:05:45| I respect very much the concept of seniority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| and then also honoring people that have been here a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| and have served honorably in the capacity as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| For that reason, and I think Tank has done a wonderful job when Tank was out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| Craig Lutho stepped in and I thought did a very good job also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| And for that reason, I would like to nominate Craig Lutho not to diminish anything from what Tank has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=373)|
| 0:06:22| but also as the final year of an eight-year term on the commission is to give Craig the opportunity to serve as our chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=382)|
| 0:06:32| And so I'm nominating Craig Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| I can make a nomination and I don't have a speech ready or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| You know, I look around the room, look at the commissioners, everyone here is a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| Everyone here was elected by their constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| So there's a lot of leadership ability here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| I go like Dr. Briggs and go back and look at who's been here the longest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| and this would maybe be their last time that maybe they could serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| So I looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| And I like the leadership skills and the preparedness that I see in Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| I'd like to nominate Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Commissioner, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| I also desire to be chairman, vice chairman, treasurer, secretary, recorder of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| But thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| I appreciate your kind words, but I withdraw my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| Well, you still owe me $20, you know, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Commissioner Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Let me say a word or two, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| I find that lots of organizations go through annual restructuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| And looking at the framers of our charter and our rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| I really can't find anything that gives me direction to why we reorganize every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| So let me just go off and speculate as to why an organization might reorganize annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| It may have something to do with trying to maintain a high level of enthusiasm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| or foster continued growth or some vigor and vitality, having new leadership each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=497)|
| 0:08:27| I also know that there are several people within this organization who have the capability of leading this organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=507)|
| 0:08:35| and if not this year, members of the body now, that will lead this organization in years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=515)|
| 0:08:45| I think for those that serve, it takes a lot of time to do what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| I know especially just sitting in the chair that I'm in takes a lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| and I know that everyone else realizes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090901annualreorganization?start=534)|
