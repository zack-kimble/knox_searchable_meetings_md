| 0:26:30| Mark Walker, 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| Mayor, Members of City Council, I thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| on KUB's proposed bond refundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| KUB has identified approximately $95 million in outstanding bonds across all four of its systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| which can be refinanced at lower interest rates and result in a substantial cost savings to KUB and its customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| In particular, based upon current bond market rates, we are estimating total debt service savings of $9.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| over the life of the bonds, and that's $7 million on a net present value basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| And how that breaks down by system is that's $3.2 million in savings for the electric system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| $2.3 million for the gas system, $1.1 million for wastewater, and $400,000 for the water system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| And I'd just point out, if authorized by Council tonight, we do plan to go to market and sell the refunding bonds sometime during the first quarter of 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1645)|
| 0:27:34| and the bonds would be sold through public competitive sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| with the bonds being awarded to the underwriters whose bids result in the lowest true interest cost to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| I also did want to point out that both KUB and the City have received a copy of the report from the Office of the State Comptroller on KUB's refunding plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1666)|
| 0:27:57| and I believe a copy of that report was provided to all the members of Council last week for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| In accordance with law and to comply with the requirements of the Comptroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| KUB does respectfully request that the Comptroller's report be reflected in the minutes of tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| And that concludes my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| Councilman Delevaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Yes, I appreciate you coming up and speaking on the front end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| One of the things that's interesting about this is that KUB has about, what, $690 million worth of outstanding bonds in these four areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1707)|
| 0:28:38| the electric, water, wastewater, gas, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| These new bond issues that you're talking about, the $95 or $97 million thereabouts, is going to retire some of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| Yes, it will retire $95 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=1732)|

| 0:34:08| But I understand that what we are doing is ensuring that provision above the area we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| self-insure with insurance for a stop-loss to mitigate any cost we'll have if they exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=2056)|

| 0:56:27| Thank you so much. I'll move it's approved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Vice Mayor Bailey. Mayor, I'm just going to say, while I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| be supporting this, I do respect all the hard work that went into it and those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| support it, and I hope it works out. All right. Councilman Patley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| Yes, Mr. Mayor, it's been motioned and seconded. I would like to request this be heard on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| reading. All right. Is that a motion, Councilman Patley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3407)|
| 0:56:56| Well, yes. It needs to come in the form of a motion, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| A motion to amend to add the emergency. Yeah, two emergencies to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Second. And the effect of that, Mr. Mayor, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| it passed on this reading. Is that the idea? Councilman Tarnas-Watson, did you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| add that? Yes, that is correct. If you pass it on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| then it will be effective immediately. All right. Well, this has been before us many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| times, so I think we're ready to vote. Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| All right. We need to vote on the emergency. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| Aye. All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| The ayes have it, and so ordered. And now we need to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| No. As amended, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| As amended to the emergency. Did you have something, Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Yes. Now that we're back to the original motion as amended, I have a few questions. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| we've spent a lot of time on this, but we are truly down to the wire with this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| I certainly want everyone who has supported this or not supported this to understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| implications of where we are. And I had a couple of questions two weeks ago for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| King, and would like to follow up on those questions today so that I'm clear in how I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| vote on this plan. But I'd like to start with Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| And Mr. Donaldson, one of the concerns that both the elected bodies, both County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| and City Council, have had about this plan is a property owner's ability to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| the uses that they have by right with their property. And my understanding with this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| is that if a property owner who has greater than 15 percent slope asks for a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| the recommendation of this plan, which Mr. Swanson, becomes law, becomes part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| general plan, is that correct, would be that a planned zone be recommended rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| than a, quote, regular zone. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Okay. And a planned zone means then that that property needs to go through a review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| by MPC, and then eventually those plans also go through review in the City Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| Department to ensure compliance. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| I really, I have serious concerns about this plan because of two things. One is the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3558)|
| 0:59:27| and plans review. I think it's important that when folks want to develop their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| when they're owners of that property, particularly in the economic environment that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| right now, that they have some sense of certainty as to what they'll be allowed to do. And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| we have an individual who wants to sell their property, the buyer really has no assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| that they will be able to develop it in the manner in which they think might be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| until the planned zone is put into place and that whole review process is going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| That leads me to my second question, and that's for Director King. Assuming that a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| goes into a planned review process and certain restrictions are put on that property, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| compliance has to be monitored by the Engineering Department in the City of Knoxville. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| correct, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| What kinds of things do you anticipate that the City might be monitoring under this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| We think we will be expected to ensure that the clearing limits are as per the plan if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3627)|
| 1:00:36| that particular requirement is placed by MPC on the use-run review. We anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| that that could take potentially a couple of more employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| And so you currently don't feel like you have the capacity and personnel to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| level of review that would be required under this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Has your department sat down and made an estimate of what the personnel needs that you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| have under this plan and what the cost to the city taxpayers might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| We think the minimal requirement would be two employees, one an engineering technician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| and an urban forester, as recommended by the plan. And that cost would be on the order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3673)|
| 1:01:21| of, with benefits, $100,000 to $120,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| The first year, and of course that compounds and escalates the longer folks are with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| city. Is that under our current development environment or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| Yes, that's our estimate for the current development environment. And obviously if things were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| better there would be more to review and it could be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| How many employees do you think we would need in a more robust development environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| We attempted to make an estimate of that based on the development that was going on in around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| 2004. And we think that might go from maybe two employees to maybe five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3714)|
| 1:02:01| And my understanding, Mr. Swanson, is that County Commission, in their consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| of this plan, changed it in such a way that they would not be bound by this level of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| at least in terms of Mr. Donaldson, the properties that are considered for change in zoning in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3733)|
| 1:02:22| the county, would not necessarily have that recommendation that they go into a plan zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| which then initiates this plan's review for compliance through engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| There's a difference between possible and probable. In the current and in the past history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| the zone of choice for residential development, both in the city and in the county, has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| planned residential zoning. So that will continue regardless of whether they pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| a hillside plan or not. So developers choose the two-step zoning because it's the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3774)|
| 1:03:02| way they can hit their markets. The current zoning ordinances are such that the markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| have moved beyond them and planned residential zoning gives the developer the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3789)|
| 1:03:16| to do the type of product that they want to do on their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| But I hear you saying that the preponderance of rezoning has been planned development at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| the developer's choice. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| And what we're talking about here is a situation where it will not be choice, at least under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| the city plan. Well, all the plan does is recommend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| you use planned residential zoning. Now, if you can make, create findings where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| are exceptions due to this particular property, you can create zoning that's consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| the plan without using a planned zone. But people choose to use the planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| Mr. King, in terms of the planned residential zoning, I understand from what is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| written in this plan that Knox County does not have the means to carry this out. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| that your understanding of where the county is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| That's my understanding, but I haven't really reviewed in detail what the county adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| Page 48 of the plan says that the city's public service department personnel are responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| for timber clearing plans and replanting plans where clearing is approved for site development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| The county has no similar review. I think my third serious concern with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| plan is what we have talked about all along, and that is that if the city adopts this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| we are setting ourselves up to have a more restrictive zoning environment than there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| exists in the county. That certainly has been the case in incidental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| kinds of ways for years, but I think when there is less developable land in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| to set ourselves up in this way to be even more restrictive is a mistake for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| and for city taxpayers. I'm concerned about the cost of personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| I'm concerned about the inequity between the city and the county, and I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| the capriciousness of planned zoning and property owners not knowing what their rights will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| be. And so for that reason, I'm sorry that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| not able to support this plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| All right. Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Donaldson, how much property are we talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| about in the city that would be affected by this plan as opposed to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| Well, certainly the majority of the property that's within the proposed hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| protection area is in the county, but there's a significant amount in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Much of it has already been developed. Places like Colston Hills where I live is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| all primarily within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| Many subdivisions within the city are within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| There is raw land still available for development within the city that is within the boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| of the protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| Oh, Councilman Delavalle. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| Thank you, Mr. Mayor. First, I have to say that I'm kind of fascinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| that Ms. Roddy sat through some of those meetings we had with the county commission and never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| expressed those views and now brings them up at the time we're voting, but that's her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| choice and she represents constituents too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| But I wanted to point out that, and Mr. King is here, Mr. King, isn't it a fact that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| just spent $5 million on Broadway to make extra flood zone space because of the kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| of development we've had in this community over the last decade and we're trying to mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| flooding from careless construction that puts too much water into the system we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| the creeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Isn't that fair to say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| There are several reasons why urban streams flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| One is an increase in impervious area through development over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| The other is because, unfortunately, in our history, we have abused urban streams by building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4028)|
| 1:07:16| structures too close to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| When floodwaters rise and structures are too close, they flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| So we have had several million dollars of projects along creeks in Knoxville where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| have not only improved the channel to carry the flow of the water, but also purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| structures that were built years ago, decades ago, in locations where they should not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| We've bought houses and torn them down so that we have additional flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| Isn't that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| We've bought houses to create additional flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| We've bought houses, we've removed structures so they would not flood because it was cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| in the long run for us to purchase the structure rather than to deal with a continuing flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| And you are already in the process of enforcing stricter stormwater regulations than we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Because that is the trend with TDEC, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| And so you are going to have to have some personnel for enforcement in any event, isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| We are and we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| Yeah, I just want to reflect, too, on a couple of points there Councilman Roddy, Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4105)|
| 1:08:33| Roddy made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| As far as, you know, us not being in, I mean, the county is not in the same position financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| as the city, but we don't have near the, you know, the jails, engine care, the libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| the school system, for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| I mean, we ought to be proud that we're not, don't have those obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| It's not a reflection on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| They do a good job with what they have, but we're in a much different position financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| and I think we should celebrate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| I don't think it's anything that we, that that's a detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| And, you know, I also don't think it's a detriment or a bad thing that if the city adopted codes enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| it was more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| I mean, you know, I don't care what I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| I've lived here all my life and when I see dimster dumpsters floating down Broadway, there's something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| I mean, there's something wrong somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| And, you know, it may be houses too close, this and that and the other, but it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| it's telling me that we've got a bad problem and we need to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| And I think that this is a good start to get that, to get those problems addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| I mean, go out to Powell, to those poor people's home where a mudslide came in on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| I mean, that stuff doesn't just happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| And to put a cost on it, I mean, I don't know how you can put a cost on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| And I don't take lightly that it may be $100,000 or it may be $500,000 if we have to hire five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| You know, one of the most, the second most profitable thing that the State of Tennessee enjoys is tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| And people come to East Tennessee for tourism because it's a beautiful part of this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| And if it takes us $300,000 to $500,000 more in a budget, then we've got to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| You know, if we've got to cut back, then let's cut back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| But we cannot afford to give up our natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| And this is a chance for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| We've already made some mistakes along the way, but this is just a wonderful opportunity to take that first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| And I'm proud to be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| And I don't think it's restrictive in any way as far as development goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| I think it's something that will preserve our community for a long time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| And then we get to enjoy people like Scripps, Green Mountain Coffee, General Mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| I mean, this is the type of legislation that attracts these people for the long time, for people to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4247)|
| 1:10:56| So, you know, I just can't see that this, you know, those points just don't carry any weight with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| So I just want to move forward with this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| I think we've got the votes to pass it, and I look forward to the beginning of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| I've taken a particular interest in this issue because the district I represent, the Fifth, has seen at least its share of flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| probably a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| And Mr. King's comment about the cost of earlier decisions that were made building close to Urban Springs is basically an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4283)|
| 1:11:36| It's on the agenda this very night in my district, 11C on Bank Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| where we actually purchased a house to demolish because it had been built too close to an urban spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4300)|
| 1:11:48| So although Councilperson Roddy's point is very well taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| and it's been reviewed during the process about how there was going to be probably a cost to enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4313)|
| 1:12:04| I think the cost, it's pretty well been demonstrated that the cost of doing nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| and non-enforcement is going to be exponentially higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| So although I do understand the necessity that we may need to add staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| and may need to spend some taxpayers' money to enforce this, I think in the long run it's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| maybe not even in the very long run, it's going to pay for itself many times over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| So I'll be voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| I'd like to ditto just some of the things that Councilman Pavlis had to say and also Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| I really don't think that you can put a cost on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| And I think it's important that we as a city, you know, go ahead and continue to take the lead in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| and go ahead and protect what it is that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| I do know that working in the development field and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| that there are ways in which, regardless of how restrictive codes may be or zoning may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| that there is ways in which you can develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| And you can develop in a proper way, in a green way, in a way that's going to protect our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| And so I'm fully in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| I think that what we have is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| We have a plan that we can continue to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| If it needs to be worked in terms of amendments or things like this, I think we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| But I think there's been an awful lot of time and effort that's been put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| I think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| I think it's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| And I'll definitely be supporting it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| A couple of weeks ago I went to see the movie The Descendants, probably because George Clooney was in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| Despite that, there was an issue about property rights that prevailed in that movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| And there was a family who was a descendant of one of the Hawaiian princesses, and they owned a huge amount of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| And some of them were running low on cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| And so they were meeting as a family to decide to sell this beautiful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| Well, of course, the scenery was spectacular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| It was totally undeveloped and just everything we think about when we think of Hawaii.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| And so as not to spoil the end, they did come to a decision about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| And as I watched that movie, I got to thinking about the issue that we've dealt with with property rights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| And historically and legally, people have never had absolute ownership of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| The Native Americans never believed we could own the land completely and totally control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| So we are not Hawaii, but we are Knoxville, Tennessee, surrounded by some of the most spectacular scenery in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| And while we may have title to a piece of property, there's a larger force at work, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| So I will definitely be supporting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| We have one person signed up to speak on this, on 12A, Robin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| If you would come down and give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| And you have five minutes, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4503)|
| 1:15:20| My name is Robert M. Robin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| I live at 11504 Mountain View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| I tell people I'm from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| I actually live in Farragut, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| I'm the chairman of the Sierra Club for this area of the 19 counties, including Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| We have about, oh, a few hundred members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| I do, I'll diverge here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| I do wish that the scouts had stayed and listened to this debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| because this kind of debate that we've had just had is the heart and soul of the way the government runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| The Sierra Club is in total support of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| and in support of the views that many of you all have spoken about concerning the good that this will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4563)|
| 1:16:12| I personally think it will do a lot of good, and I've told you that from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| So we would be pleased if you could see your way clear to adopt this plan tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4578)|
| 1:16:28| and lead the way for the rest of the county to eventually move to what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| It's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| I think it's sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| I think, and I've said this before, in the next ten years you'll look back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| and you'll say, yes, that was a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| I walk on Third Creek Walking Trail occasionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| and there's a list of a bronze plaque down there on the east end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| One of the names on it is Ed Shouse, and that was put in there in 1973, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| And I don't remember whether that was controversial or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| A lot of people gave land to make that particular feature of the town an important recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| and walking feature, which is used by hundreds of people every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| It's just the kind of thing that you do when you think ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| and think how the town is going to develop and how you'd like to see it develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| not for yourselves but for your children and grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| Many of you have expressed a lot of good reasons for doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| and I hope you support the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| I'm going to diverge you again for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| and I just want to say that for the councilmen that are leaving this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| and for you, Mayor, you all will be remembered first as a group of a very small number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| since this country started who have served on governing bodies like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| Bodies like this are the heart and soul of bringing to life the things that are in our Declaration of Independence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4686)|
| 1:18:15| and our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| This is the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| It's kind of messy sometimes, but this is the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| And to you all who are retiring, since I've been there myself sitting about where Ms. Wrighty sits right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4703)|
| 1:18:32| it takes a lot of time to do this, which many ordinary citizens don't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| But it does take time, regardless of which side you are on an issue, you are holding on an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| because you folks do your homework and you have a sense of the issue when you come to the table to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4725)|
| 1:18:53| That's the only way you can govern, the only way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| And for you, Mayor, I think that you've done a remarkable job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| and with grace and dignity governing this town as mayor during your period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| You won't be forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Councilman Dellavopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| I think it's fair to say that everyone on this council wants to see healthy development move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4756)|
| 1:19:24| And if there is something in this plan that has an unintended consequence of impacting that unfairly, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4764)|
| 1:19:34| do we not have the ability to not only adopt a plan, but amend a plan if we have issues with it over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| So I think moving forward is a healthy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| And if we find in growing pains that there is something wrong, I think we need to get it on the table and get it fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| But I urge us to move forward and take the first step in protecting what is left of a sound, natural environment that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4791)|
| 1:20:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell, just for the sake of clarity, to state what we're voting on at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4803)|
| 1:20:11| To approve Ordinance 12A as amended to an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4811)|

| 1:20:23| Do we need a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| How many do you need, six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4827)|

| 1:20:53| And I think that maybe a round of applause for Tony and his whole group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| There were a whole group of you that have worked, and there are a lot of you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111213specialcalled?start=4858)|
