| 2:21:51| Department, who sent an officer out to look at the situation and to ascertain whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| the animals were adequately prepared for the weather conditions. I spoke to him after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8514)|
| 2:21:59| his investigation was completed and he stated that legally the individuals who own the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| dogs were not in violation of any law currently and according to the current ordinances, nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| could be done to ensure the animals' welfare during the extreme weather conditions of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| winter storm advisory. He felt that his hands were tied, but he too was concerned for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8533)|
| 2:22:18| dogs and other ones that he had been seeing. I am completely against unsupervised tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8538)|
| 2:22:27| Attaching an animal to a pulley or any other type of tether comes with a lot of risk, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| lot of which you've already heard. The animal can get entangled, hanged, or even begin having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| behavior issues such as aggression. It leaves the dog with limited ability to defend itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8556)|
| 2:22:41| and the possibility of unwanted pregnancies, which place further demand on our local rescues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8561)|
| 2:22:46| and shelters. The American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Society of Plastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8566)|
| 2:22:53| Surgeons have teamed up to promote responsible dog ownership, pointing out that tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| dogs contribute to aggressive behavior. Quote, confine your dog in a fence yard or a dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8578)|
| 2:23:03| run when it is not in the house. Never tether or chain your dog because this can contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| to aggressive behavior, end quote. I believe that our current ordinances need to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8588)|
| 2:23:13| to give our animal control officers the ability to educate individuals that they encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| how to properly care for their animals. This ordinance intends to define better minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| standards of care for that benefit, not only for the officers that have to enforce those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| ordinances, but also for the owners so they know what is expected of them as the caregivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| of these animals. I feel like Knoxville is far behind in a lot of these areas and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8611)|
| 2:23:38| is a good time for us to bring it up to the 21st century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| Please consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| The next speaker is Kenny Riffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| If you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8629)|
| 2:23:55| have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| My name is Kenny Riffey. My address is 2320 East 5th Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8640)|
| 2:24:08| And I'm glad I'm speaking at this point in the program because I can say yes to all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| the above. Everything that's been said so far is something that I would have said if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| I had more than three minutes. But my story is I lived down the street from Bear for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8657)|
| 2:24:26| number of years and every time I walked by Bear, I was so sad for him because he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| sitting on the front porch chained with a big giant chain around his neck. And when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| his owner came home, she walked right past him and ignored him. And I said, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| mind if I took Bear for a walk? And she said, no, no, you can't take Bear for a walk because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8683)|
| 2:24:49| then he'll get used to people and he won't bark when somebody comes around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| Well, you can on Amazon today buy a ring doorbell for $249 and a couple of cameras, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8693)|
| 2:25:03| will tell you if somebody's coming on your property. A dog is not an alarm system. A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8703)|
| 2:25:10| dog, we've domesticated them, we've made them a part of our lives, and they need to be cared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8710)|
| 2:25:16| for because it's been stated on a number of, from a number of speakers, they're not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| to take care of themselves. So I support the ordinances that are being proposed, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8720)|
| 2:25:29| I don't know, am I allowed to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| Ms. Griffey, this is our opportunity to listen, and the council will have a full discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8733)|
| 2:25:38| at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8738)|
| 2:25:39| And I will state what my question would be. My question was, I have a little chihuahua| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| who loves to sit in the sun, and I can let her outside and let her go potty and let her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| sit in the sun for 15 or 20 minutes, and I was unclear as to whether this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8748)|
| 2:25:53| would stop me from doing that. So if it would, I feel like a little bit of an amendment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8753)|
| 2:25:58| some sort would be in order for those of us who just like to let our dogs out on a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| leash and let them go potty and then come back inside. So I was not clear on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| it was a full ban on ever letting your dog outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| And that will do it. That's it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8774)|
| 2:26:22| Thank you. Council members, the final member of the public who signed up to speak on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8782)|
| 2:26:30| is Mabry Morales. Mabry? You could lower the microphone for her. You could start by stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8790)|
| 2:26:39| your name and address for the record, and then you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8799)|
| 2:26:47| My name is Mabry Morales. My address is 8101 Osler Lane. Dogs' lives are depending on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8807)|
| 2:27:01| The ones out in the cold and heat, out there not able to escape. No one is there to save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8821)|
| 2:27:08| them, but you have the power to set them free. The suffering from suffering. What if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8828)|
| 2:27:18| were on a train in the hot and the cold snow? How would you feel? Set them free. The choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8838)|
| 2:27:30| to save them, help us help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8850)|
| 2:27:44| Thank you so much. Council members, that concludes the people who have spoken, who have signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8864)|
| 2:27:52| up to speak. Any further questions or discussion? Okay. Council member Testament, did you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8872)|
| 2:28:03| to speak? Your light's not working. Okay. Sorry. Just raise your hand, then, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8883)|
| 2:28:10| I don't see your light, but you did signal to me. So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8890)|
| 2:28:16| I can't hear you. Maybe use Mr. Thomas's, or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8896)|
| 2:28:27| It might be on purpose. We would not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8907)|
| 2:28:33| Thank you to everyone who spoke, and I think there's no question that everybody here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8913)|
| 2:28:42| animal lovers and really seeking animal welfare, the best in animal welfare. Let me first say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8922)|
| 2:28:51| that I used to feel that tethering an animal was inherent cruelty and could not comprehend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| such action from a pet owner. Of course no one wants an animal living outside and tethered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8938)|
| 2:29:04| with no quality of life. It's an emotional issue. It's a very visual issue, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8944)|
| 2:29:09| a lot below the surface of this issue that needs to be considered. After 11 1⁄2 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8949)|
| 2:29:16| in animal welfare with a commitment to save lives and increase the standards of animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8956)|
| 2:29:21| welfare in our community for both pets and pet owners, I have learned that tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| is largely a symptom of poverty as opposed to an act of cruelty and neglect. An ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| is intended to change behavior, and tethering is not about behavior. Tethering results from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8972)|
| 2:29:37| a lack of resources, and there is no question that a law that bans tethering will disproportionately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8977)|
| 2:29:43| hurt low-income and underserved families in our communities. Ordinances can't pick and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8983)|
| 2:29:48| choose who is impacted, which ultimately becomes punitive and discriminatory. To be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8988)|
| 2:29:55| tethering is not something the Animal Control Board, Young-Williams Animal Center, nor I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| encourage. However, a ban on unsupervised tethering is a solution to the wrong problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8999)|
| 2:30:07| Currently we are prevented from helping tethered pets because the local sheltering standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| are too low. With the leverage of higher standards and humane standards of tethering, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| no fixed point tethering, which this Ordinance 12B does, animal control officers would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9017)|
| 2:30:24| the opportunity to remove pets who are truly abused or support and educate pet owners who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| simply lack resources and information, which is the focus, as you've heard, of Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9029)|
| 2:30:35| Pets for Life program. In the boots and the ground, and also from Mr. Merritt, who you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9035)|
| 2:30:42| heard from, we met through going door-to-door and building relationships with pet owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9042)|
| 2:30:49| What I will say is pet owners, we cannot focus solely on the well-being of pets. Pet owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9049)|
| 2:30:55| must be a part of the conversation, including how to keep pets with their people. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| cannot be the mindset that pets are a luxury, and if you can't afford a pet, you don't deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| the love of a pet. There is no cultural or socioeconomic boundary to someone being a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| pet owner, as I hope my colleagues saw from the Pets for Life videos that they were sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9071)|
| 2:31:19| The reality is 24% of Knoxvillians live in poverty, which is nearly 50,000 people. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| the national statistic of 47% of households own dogs is applied, that's nearly 15,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9085)|
| 2:31:31| low-income dog owners. And given that 53% of city of Knoxville residents are renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| it is a reality that many landlords don't allow pets inside or charge high pet deposits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| and renters don't have control over building a fence. I think fences are great. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9102)|
| 2:31:48| the effort that Chain Free is doing is terrific, but they are also not the cure-all. They are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| expensive, so many homeowners who own pets can't afford to build a fence, and a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| ban would effectively become a mandatory fence ordinance and once again disproportionately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9118)|
| 2:32:04| impact low-income pet owners, not to mention that there are far more dogs that are escaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9124)|
| 2:32:11| fences than tethers and running at large, as they are brought into our shelter an average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| of 40 a day. Many HOAs don't allow fencing. There are often height requirements, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9137)|
| 2:32:25| hear story after story of escape artists and dogs climbing over or digging under to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| out. Chain Free criteria is an owner has to be willing to consent to the dog being spayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| and neutered, so if an owner doesn't consent, they are in violation. A ban also impedes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9156)|
| 2:32:41| people's willingness to adopt. The argument could actually be made that if the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9161)|
| 2:32:46| are there and the community is supportive, why do we even need a tethering ban ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9166)|
| 2:32:51| at all? The best path forward is improving the quality of life for outdoor pets by significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9171)|
| 2:32:56| updating the sheltering laws. Tethering is a small piece of the pie, and we need to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| at the full breadth and depth of the issue as it relates to overall increased sheltering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| standards. I do want to ask Chief Noel, as it relates to animal control, if you wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9186)|
| 2:33:13| mind sharing your previous experience as it relates to tethered dogs, as well as your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9193)|
| 2:33:18| thoughts on the enforceability of passing a ban on unsupervised tethering, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9198)|
| 2:33:22| increased call volume that would result. So my concern, my only concern with this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9202)|
| 2:33:33| be the call volume for animal control. You know, we're a small police department. Violent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| crime is our top priority. And my concern would be, you know, the volume that our animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| control officers would have to respond to. I guess my other concern would be for police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9222)|
| 2:33:47| officers would have to go out and potentially assist animal control on calls if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9227)|
| 2:33:55| a confrontation between a pet owner and an animal control officer. We'd have to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9235)|
| 2:34:02| a police officer out. So we're potentially sending out, you know, police officers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9242)|
| 2:34:06| you know, get involved in these confrontations. And, you know, I would have to speak with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| the law department about the legality of animal control going on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9250)|
| 2:34:14| especially backyards, to investigate potential tethering issues. That would be my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9254)|
| 2:34:21| just from an enforcement capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9261)|
| 2:34:25| Thank you. And you've shared with me in the past some of your experience in the past as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9265)|
| 2:34:31| it relates to tethered dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9271)|
| 2:34:34| So I'm not an expert on this by any means, right. But my experience as a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9274)|
| 2:34:40| in an urban environment for the last 25 years is normally, you know, more poor people, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9280)|
| 2:34:46| of color tether their dogs. That's just my anecdotal experience working for 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9286)|
| 2:34:53| in an urban environment. I am not an expert on this at all. That's just my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9293)|
| 2:34:59| Councilmember Testerman, your five minutes expired, so I'm going to go to another councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9299)|
| 2:35:05| and come back to you as needed. Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9305)|
| 2:35:10| Yeah. I think what we can clearly see is there's a lot we agree on. I want to start by thanking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9310)|
| 2:35:18| the many people that have spent time over the past two years working on the revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| to the Animal Welfare Code. We have a number of concerned citizens that organized themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| to create the Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance as well as Chain Free Knoxville. Clearly we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| have many other people like Pets for Life that are involved and, you know, our many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| folks that work at Young Williams and other organizations. These organizations focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9335)|
| 2:35:41| on looking at best practices for animal welfare and code across the country and reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9341)|
| 2:35:46| to the city administration and the Animal Control Board to evaluate our standards of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| care and the culture around it. I particularly want to thank the Animal Control Board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| Councilwoman Testerman. It's not fun to be at odds with one of your colleagues and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9355)|
| 2:36:01| just clear that we just don't agree on a point. I want to thank all of these people for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9361)|
| 2:36:07| amount of time and the efforts they've put into looking after animal welfare, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9367)|
| 2:36:12| as members of Animal Control Board but also in their day jobs. I want to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9372)|
| 2:36:17| As to be expected, everyone is in agreement on reasonable and increased standards for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9377)|
| 2:36:21| dogs who live primarily outdoors. The point of contention is the singular difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| the two ordinances, which is in 11C, that section of the ordinances. And those are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9386)|
| 2:36:33| standards for tethering of dogs. Over the last two years, Animal Control Board has reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9393)|
| 2:36:40| revised, and edited both versions, which you are seeing tonight. They've actually voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9400)|
| 2:36:44| on both versions. And I want to be really, really, really clear, neither is a total ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9404)|
| 2:36:52| There is no banning of tethering. You can still tether your animal and I would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9412)|
| 2:36:56| that and I'll state why in a moment. Neither ordinance requires anybody to bring their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| animal inside. I was raised with outdoor dogs. My dad never wanted an indoor dog and in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| I never thought I would have one. That's, I guess, thanks to my husband that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| indoor dogs and obviously we're committed now, as many of us are to our pets. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9432)|
| 2:37:18| going to sit here and debate what's humane because that's the point that we don't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| on. Some people think one thing's humane and other people think another thing is. Let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| talk about the two, I'm going to talk about safety. Safety and fear and quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| in our neighborhoods. So we're comparing the two versions of tethering. One is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9453)|
| 2:37:39| trolley tethering with no restraint, with no fixed point tethering. And that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9459)|
| 2:37:47| and then the other is required supervision of tethering and minimum standards for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| which just allows unsupervised tethering. My grandmother used to come home from Walmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9470)|
| 2:37:55| and she would put her dog on a simple tether, clip it to its collar and let it go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| go to the bathroom after the dog had been inside for the day. I believe that my grandmother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9479)|
| 2:38:05| should be able to do that and anyone else should be able to let their dog out for, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| know, the simple potty breaks or a short time outside. And I would consider that supervised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| and that's part of the language that was debated with animal control. They talked about enforceability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9495)|
| 2:38:21| On the basis of community safety, I support 12C, no unsupervised tethering. There was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9501)|
| 2:38:27| a comment made that the image of a pet on a tether is emotional. I'm going to be honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| with you guys, I'm not as emotional and attached to animals as, say, my friend Kyle is out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| there. I'm not as moved and as emotional about it, so I'm not going to focus on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9516)|
| 2:38:42| I'm terrified of dogs that break free from their tethers and their leads. If you've ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9522)|
| 2:38:46| been on the receiving end of a dog attack, it's a horrible, horrible experience. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9526)|
| 2:38:53| I won't bore you with it unless you want. But it involved a lot of sleepless nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9533)|
| 2:38:58| and not being able to get to sleep afterwards. And I have two experiences with that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9538)|
| 2:39:04| so I don't ever want to repeat that. And there's just countless examples of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9544)|
| 2:39:09| that have been attacked by animals that break free. And we shouldn't have to do that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| someone has the idea that there's no other means, because there are. The language in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9555)|
| 2:39:21| this ordinance was carefully vetted for six months and approved in 2022 by the Animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| Control Board, animal control officers, and the law department. In fact, it was written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9565)|
| 2:39:29| by the law department. It gives animal control officers another tool in their enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9569)|
| 2:39:34| matrix to address animal safety. And during the six months of drafting this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| they discussed language that could and could not be enforced. There is no immediate cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9578)|
| 2:39:42| for unsupervised tethering, except going and buying a trolley is a cost that would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9582)|
| 2:39:48| for people. I'm going to run out of time here. I want to note, importantly, that of the 63| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9588)|
| 2:39:55| dogs Chain Free has provided enclosures for, and one of the houses that I went to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| to build for, it was two different dogs in one yard that couldn't be together, so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| got separate enclosures. Three of the recent females they've surveyed had eight litters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| each with 70 unplanned puppies. That is a burden on our system. That is a burden on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9608)|
| 2:40:14| our animal control and our shelter to have all those unplanned puppies. You've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9614)|
| 2:40:21| people talk about dogs being attacked and people being attacked in the safety element,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| and since I'm out of time, I'm going to say that that is the reason that I can't support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9625)|
| 2:40:32| unsupervised tethering. It's purely for the safety element for the people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9632)|
| 2:40:37| Thank you. Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9637)|
| 2:40:50| I want to thank both of my colleagues for working so hard on this issue and bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9650)|
| 2:40:56| these items forward for us to review. I did find the process a bit frustrating because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9656)|
| 2:41:04| I had my own edits to suggest for the ordinance that was towed. It's already gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9664)|
| 2:41:11| the law department, and so we can't make edits, but I feel like if we were able to, as a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9671)|
| 2:41:19| to have more input on the front end, it would make these discussions easier. For instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9679)|
| 2:41:33| one comment was made about folks being able to let their animals out for 10, 20 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9693)|
| 2:41:42| for a bathroom break while they're inside the house. The way I read the ordinance under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9702)|
| 2:41:49| 12C is that would not be allowed because the ordinance under 12C requires a responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9709)|
| 2:41:59| and competent person to be outside with the animal within visual range of the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9719)|
| 2:42:06| That's one section I was trying to make edits to so that if you were sitting in your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| at your kitchen table, even watching your pet through the kitchen window, you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9732)|
| 2:42:19| accused of being in violation of this ordinance. You are present and you are supervising your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9739)|
| 2:42:26| pet. That was one concern for me. And then just a few items below that, just in how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9746)|
| 2:42:38| define what length the tether should be. The way I read it is if you have a really large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9758)|
| 2:42:47| English mastiff, they need a minimum of 40 feet, but we're asking for a minimum of 10 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9767)|
| 2:42:54| and so it needs to be written differently so that we are achieving the goal that we hope to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9774)|
| 2:43:03| So I felt like there were a few edits that were needed to get to where we wanted to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9783)|
| 2:43:10| and I also wanted to suggest an amendment where we add a review process into this so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9790)|
| 2:43:17| that we can see what the impact, after a certain amount of time, is on our community so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9797)|
| 2:43:25| we can ensure that some of these concerns and fears that we have are not realized and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9805)|
| 2:43:31| we do not see our local animal shelters filling up rather than pet owners being re-educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9811)|
| 2:43:42| and those pets and owners staying together. I sent in my edits. I honestly didn't send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9822)|
| 2:43:50| in my name to co-sponsor this item. I don't know how that happened, but I just have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9830)|
| 2:43:59| say it was a little bit of a frustrating process, but I'm in support of strengthening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9839)|
| 2:44:06| our standards of care for pets in our city, and I'm in support of us doing the work tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9846)|
| 2:44:15| to make the amendments needed and pass an ordinance that we can be proud of, but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9855)|
| 2:44:22| wanted to raise those couple of concerns about the process and kind of give you all a heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9862)|
| 2:44:29| up that I have a few amendments to recommend tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| Thank you. Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9872)|

| 2:44:39| What I will share is that I was not a dog person until about 14 years ago when a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9879)|
| 2:44:48| Yorkie entered into my life, and then I got an affinity for dogs. In the course of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9888)|
| 2:44:58| love for my pet, we were attacked by a dog in 2011. I don't know if that dog had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9898)|
| 2:45:07| tethered or not. Its owner was sitting outside when it did attack us and tried to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9907)|
| 2:45:13| dog off of us, but we both have scars to prove that, and I do want to say that in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9913)|
| 2:45:21| that I live in, we have coyotes, we have foxes, we even had a bear show up in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9921)|
| 2:45:29| in Jehowie Hills, and so I think about if there was a dog that was tethered and no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9929)|
| 2:45:37| was not in visual eyesight of their dog, what potentially could happen. My dog is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9937)|
| 2:45:44| old now, so I'm able to let my dog go outside, and I stand in the door, I look out the window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9944)|

| 2:45:53| that it's a real concern. I know that there are people who do keep their dogs on chains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9953)|
| 2:45:58| I have a friend who, unfortunately, a family member was watching his dog. He didn't chain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9958)|
| 2:46:04| his dog, but his family member, when he was out of town, put the dog on a chain and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9964)|
| 2:46:09| it outside, and when he came back, the dog had hung itself, unfortunately. Not to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9969)|
| 2:46:14| that that happens on a daily basis, but that's pretty traumatic, when, as we know, our dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9974)|
| 2:46:20| are like family members. There are some people who don't treat dogs like family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| who do want to treat, who want to make dogs mean and use them as a means of protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9985)|

| 2:46:37| to do that, and to me, that is a huge concern. I do, you know, thank my colleague for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=9997)|
| 2:46:44| work that she's put into this, as well as Chain Free Knoxville and the research that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10004)|
| 2:46:49| gone into this. I will be supporting this amendment and resolution, because I am very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10009)|
| 2:46:58| concerned with the well-being of animals and do think that there potentially could be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10018)|
| 2:47:03| things that we could do in here. I'll wait to hear Councilmember Parker's recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10023)|
| 2:47:09| that could get us to a better space where it's amenable for everyone, but I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| that if I'm standing at my door, if I'm looking out of my window and I put my dog on a, someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10034)|

| 2:47:23| see, think that we're going to get a lot of phone calls where people are going to be calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| in on neighbors unless they really feel that a dog is being in an abusive situation, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10046)|
| 2:47:33| if that is the case, then that call does need to be made. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10053)|

| 2:48:34| is on record saying that while they discourage chronic tethering, tethering is a result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10114)|
| 2:48:39| owners needing support and access to resources, not intentional cruelty. They say that distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10119)|
| 2:48:46| is important so that we move away from criminalizing poverty and demonizing pet owners who face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| socioeconomic and access to care challenges. Eighty percent of low-income pet owners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10131)|
| 2:48:59| never reached out to a local agency because they don't know that there are options, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10139)|
| 2:49:04| resources exist, or they're afraid of being judged. So the focus needs to be on education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10144)|
| 2:49:10| and community outreach, which translates to more bridge building and establishing trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10150)|
| 2:49:15| The solution is not to be punitive, but instead to provide resources and alternatives. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10155)|

| 2:49:48| tethering does not mean we don't care about the animals. That's a false equivalency. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10188)|
| 2:49:54| no question tethering happens, but there are more effective ways to address the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10194)|
| 2:49:59| which result in fewer dogs being tethered, better relationships, as well as more sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10199)|
| 2:50:04| solutions. Some fixes may not be perfect, but perfect cannot be the enemy of the good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10204)|
| 2:50:11| and a ban on unsupervised tethering does not fix the quality of life issue. Animals are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10211)|

| 2:50:22| and if they're fenced, it doesn't mean that they have the basics. So, the surveys conducted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10222)|

| 2:51:26| irresponsible and a cruel pet owner because your pets are outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10286)|

| 2:51:44| There were definitely references to people who have their pets outside as being irresponsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10304)|
| 2:51:50| and invoking cruelty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10310)|
| 2:51:54| I just want to talk mostly about this, the tethering and dogs getting attacked outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10314)|
| 2:52:00| on their tethers and pregnant puppies running around. I have a large dog and I've got pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10320)|
| 2:52:09| of baby kittens. You know, I've got three dogs and cats and kittens. They all get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10329)|
| 2:52:16| But on this tether stuff, if you've got two trees or two poles and a lead for your dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10336)|
| 2:52:24| you put the dog on there, you go down each way, and you put a stop before that dog can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10344)|
| 2:52:34| get to the weeds or the, you know, or wrap around a pole. I go out there, my dog's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10354)|
| 2:52:39| a runner from here to the mayor, and I go out there with stuffed toys and run back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10359)|
| 2:52:45| forth with him. I've never had a dog get hurt on a tether. I've never had dogs come and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10365)|
| 2:52:52| attack because I spay and neuter my pets. And usually a dog's not going to come and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10372)|
| 2:52:57| attack another, you know, dog or try and mount and make babies outside. But this tether stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10377)|
| 2:53:06| all you've got to do is be smarter than your dog. Just put a brake on it before they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10386)|
| 2:53:10| reach the bushes. And I have limbs, so I tie them to a tight limb and that gives the runner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10390)|
| 2:53:17| a little bit of play, so it doesn't have as much tendency to break. And I've had pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10397)|
| 2:53:23| since I was a teenager, wild and domestic. So, like I said, I've never had a tether break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10403)|
| 2:53:31| and I've never had a dog get tangled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10411)|

| 2:53:44| Thank you. Mine are more questions and I don't know who can answer them. So, don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10424)|
| 2:53:48| you love that? Questions and free for all. So, in trying to understand the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10428)|
| 2:53:59| my question is, what happens if a renter has a pet outside and the landlord wants to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10439)|
| 2:54:14| it, but the renter refuses a gift of a fence? And my understanding is the fence is not fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10454)|
| 2:54:22| in the whole yard, it's fencing in the appropriate amount of space. So, there could be property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10462)|
| 2:54:28| owners that don't want that on their property. I'm just thinking about the enforcement piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10468)|
| 2:54:33| so eventually does that renter have to give up their dog because they will be not in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10473)|
| 2:54:41| I mean, that's one of my questions and this is not a new mantra of mine, but we make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10481)|
| 2:54:52| lot of ordinances as a city that are complaint driven and hard to enforce. This will be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10492)|
| 2:55:01| one regardless, but that concerns me that then we set citizens up for an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10501)|
| 2:55:10| that a problem is going to be fixed. It's not always fixed to people's satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10510)|
| 2:55:17| and then we cause problems with trust in government when an ordinance is made that cannot be enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10517)|
| 2:55:27| like noise ordinance or other things that we talk about, the Airbnbs, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10527)|
| 2:55:35| So, can anybody tell me, I know we've got six months to work on it, but what if a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10535)|
| 2:55:41| owner refuses, then does the renter have to sacrifice their pet or pay a fine for however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10541)|
| 2:55:48| long? What's the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10548)|
| 2:55:52| I'm going to see if the law director can take a stab at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10552)|
| 2:55:57| Yeah, I mean, because that could very well happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| I mean, as I understand your question, it's if you've got a renter who's renting premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10560)|
| 2:56:06| and as a pet, the owner will not allow a fence to be constructed. Renters are going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10566)|
| 2:56:14| to make some decisions, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10574)|
| 2:56:18| So they may have to turn their dog loose or turn it into the shelter or try to rehome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10578)|
| 2:56:24| but the human could lose their companion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| Or seek another residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10590)|
| 2:56:31| I mean, it'll be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10591)|
| 2:56:35| Folks, I'm not against you, and I'm just really trying to understand the real life ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10595)|
| 2:56:43| for this. So, yes, people either move or they surrender their pet. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10603)|
| 2:56:52| I'm not sure who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10612)|
| 2:56:56| Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| Is that for you or for Ms. Testa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| Sure, I'll take a whirl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| I think the general agreement here is that long hours of tethering is generally unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10624)|
| 2:57:11| So I think that there's agreement on that, generally speaking. I think the question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10631)|
| 2:57:15| supervised is one that I'm just unresolved about. I have the same concern as Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10635)|
| 2:57:22| Parker in terms of, I just know, I have witnessed, you know, with this on mine for the past few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10642)|
| 2:57:28| months, I've witnessed a lot of people who put their dog out for 15 minutes while they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10648)|
| 2:57:33| put their makeup on before work or use the bathroom themselves, whatever, that let the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| dog kind of be out there alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10658)|
| 2:57:42| So I'm not really sure what the right amendment is for that. I think I've thought about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10662)|
| 2:57:46| 30-minute rule, but I'm also convinced that that's hard to regulate as well. So whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10666)|
| 2:57:54| we do is going to be a little messy. I think to think that we nailed this and everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10674)|

| 2:58:07| false expectation. So it will be clunky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10687)|
| 2:58:12| With that said, I'm generally curious about the communication process from the city for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10692)|
| 2:58:16| whatever we choose. I think this is, what would be the way we communicate this and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10696)|
| 2:58:24| it unique in any way beyond other ordinance changes we make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10704)|
| 2:58:29| Well, I think that anytime we, you know, change ordinance, we try to communicate that to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10709)|
| 2:58:35| when it was a change in speed limit minimums. We had a big campaign and this might, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10715)|
| 2:58:43| know, we might try to do something similar if that's the direction that council takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10723)|
| 2:58:48| and adopts a change. And I just, you know, want to take, you know, just say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10728)|
| 2:58:53| to council members. I know you've been discussing this off and on for 18 months, and I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10733)|
| 2:59:00| to thank the members of the Animal Control Board who do this as volunteers and with expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10740)|
| 2:59:07| as well. So I know it's been a lot of work by a lot of people, including the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10747)|
| 2:59:14| signed up and attended our meeting tonight on their behalf. So if council changes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10754)|
| 2:59:19| ordinance, we will do our best to communicate that to people, whatever those changes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10759)|
| 2:59:24| I know we delayed the start of that for, when we passed it, we kicked out the date, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10764)|
| 2:59:29| six months or nine months. I don't know what my colleagues think, but this is a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10769)|
| 2:59:34| that obviously a whole community feels pretty passionate about. I think it's worth communicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10774)|
| 2:59:38| effectively. I do have a question for the alliance. Did somebody, Ms. Lang, want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10778)|
| 2:59:47| answer a question? I think I heard another speaker suggest that the alliance is prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10787)|
| 2:59:55| to offer these fencings to anyone who needs one. Is that a commitment that you're willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10795)|
| 3:00:02| to make? Yes, we commit to offering this fence for anybody regardless of their financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10802)|
| 3:00:08| circumstance with the caveat that they spay or neuter their dog, and we do pay for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10808)|

| 3:00:19| a quick note, we have about 50 to 60 percent of our fences are built for renters, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10819)|
| 3:00:25| never had a landlord refuse. Just some personal experience. Like I said, I know a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10825)|
| 3:00:36| who let their dog out for 10 or 15 minutes. I think Councilman Ryder, you made a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| earlier around watching, maybe a relative had watched the animal out in the yard. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10841)|
| 3:00:47| my read on this as well that you wouldn't be able to watch from the kitchen table or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10847)|
| 3:00:50| the window for 10 or 15 minutes. Is that right for the ordinance you proposed? I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10850)|
| 3:00:58| be clear that the ordinance I proposed did go through animal control board and the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10858)|
| 3:01:03| was worked on with animal control and animal control officers as well as members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10863)|
| 3:01:08| community. So I didn't write it, so I just think it's really clear. It says within visual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10868)|
| 3:01:16| range of the animal. I know there's not a time element in it because animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10876)|
| 3:01:22| officers said that wasn't something that was enforceable. But you have to be outside with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10882)|
| 3:01:26| them, is that right? That is what is in there, outside with the animal and within visual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| range. Somebody asked me if someone was blind, how that would impact them, and I was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10889)|
| 3:01:35| it says visual range. It doesn't mean you have to be able to see them. So I would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10895)|
| 3:01:41| a lawyer what that means. Okay, if I just may finish a couple other things. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10901)|
| 3:01:47| I would err on the side of animal welfare and I guess as a result of that I would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10907)|
| 3:01:56| support 12C. With that said, we're not all going to get out of this perfect, so let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10916)|
| 3:02:04| not pretend that any of these are going to be, but cheers. Sorry. I also think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10924)|
| 3:02:10| been some conversation around whether a dog gets loose from a chain and goes and attacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10930)|
| 3:02:16| I may be a bad dog owner, but every dog I've ever owned before the one I have now was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10936)|
| 3:02:22| a fence and they all got out. And now, they just ended up licking people and chasing cows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10942)|
| 3:02:28| but the one I have now, we don't have a fence, we don't tether him, and he's gotten loose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10948)|
| 3:02:35| and chased my neighbor's chicken. So I think all dogs can get out. They're all equally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10955)|
| 3:02:43| at risk. I don't know if that's right or not, but I think the idea of just a chained up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10963)|
| 3:02:50| dog is going to cause harm or get loose is not what I've experienced. So maybe I need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10970)|
| 3:02:58| where's the international dog trainer? Maybe I need some help. But the only question I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10978)|
| 3:03:03| have is just around, I don't have a good answer for the person who lets the dog out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10983)|
| 3:03:09| for 10 or 15 minutes. I do think it's reasonable to expect in all practical reality that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10989)|
| 3:03:15| neighbor is not going to call on them if they see them doing that 10 or 15 minutes at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10995)|
| 3:03:19| time. So it will be against this ordinance technically, but I don't think that somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| who sees good dog kind of tethering for 10 minutes is going to call on them. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11003)|
| 3:03:30| think that's the reality we should expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11010)|
| 3:03:33| Thank you, Council Member Smith. I think Council Member Testerman might be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11013)|
| 3:03:39| I wanted to ask if Officer Reagan would be willing to come up and just share a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11019)|
| 3:03:49| bit about your experience and as far as be it tethered dogs or dogs running enlarged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11029)|
| 3:03:55| and what your perspective is as far as the enforceability of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11035)|
| 3:04:02| So a lot of people that are with, you know, chain-free and completely getting rid of tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11042)|
| 3:04:11| or I'm sorry, unsupervised tethering, a lot of the things that they're mentioning is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11051)|
| 3:04:18| they're only focusing on the dogs that are currently on chains getting loose and being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11058)|
| 3:04:24| aggressive and attacking. We've had plenty of dogs break free from inside their house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11064)|
| 3:04:30| because they push through the doors, they have children walking the dogs that the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11070)|
| 3:04:40| cannot hold, you know, or a dog sees a squirrel and it gets loose from an owner that can handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11080)|
| 3:04:49| the dog normally and it goes after another dog. So I think more of the focus that needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11089)|
| 3:04:55| to be is the responsibility of owners and the time that they're taking to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11095)|
| 3:05:05| I mean obviously as an animal control officer we do not like seeing dogs on chains. I personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11105)|
| 3:05:12| would not keep my dog on chains but that's me. I can't speak for somebody based on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11112)|
| 3:05:18| cultural, you know, and their way of living on how they keep their animals. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11118)|
| 3:05:24| one thing that we all agree on is a better way of keeping animals and as far as like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11124)|
| 3:05:33| weather, when weather comes, you know, dogs on chains, right now we don't have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11133)|
| 3:05:39| specifying for weather, for extreme weather, whether it's rain or snow or low temperatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11139)|
| 3:05:46| and so I think if that's getting added into the ordinance it would be better than just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11146)|
| 3:05:53| completely getting rid of tethering. Thank you. Could you state your name for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11153)|

| 3:06:50| Call volume and statistics got brought up. I wanted to comment that Councilwoman Testament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11210)|
| 3:06:56| actually provided us with that information. 9,500 calls, 1,500 and some changes rounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11216)|
| 3:07:04| up to 1,600 were welfare checks. Some of them were about neighbors fighting, no shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11224)|
| 3:07:11| no food. There were 20 dead animals, 39 tangled up. So we're not talking about a high volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11231)|
| 3:07:21| of dogs that are being called in because they're tethered or chained because those calls were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11241)|

| 3:07:40| are not a hotbed of HOAs. Just going to put that out there. All the trolleys and tethers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11260)|
| 3:07:49| in the stores are labeled very clearly. I went and bought one. Don't use without supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| so I think it's weird that we would promote that. The other thing I want to say is, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11274)|
| 3:07:59| know, listening to experts. I can't find a veterinarian to tell me it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11279)|

| 3:08:18| my dog isn't aggressive. The people that have refused enclosures from Chain Free Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11298)|
| 3:08:25| which is a minimal amount, is because they didn't want to spay or neuter. And by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11305)|

| 3:08:52| about dogs that get loose that are normal behaving dogs. We're talking about dogs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11332)|
| 3:08:57| are trained and conditioned to be mean. That is a cultural thing. And we have to ask ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11337)|

| 3:10:04| opportunity for them to take their dog to a dog park. We're about to add five new dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11404)|
| 3:10:09| parks if we haven't already opened some of them. And those are no cost. Those are zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11409)|
| 3:10:13| cost. Most of the time I find them empty. We are at a point to support this as a culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11413)|

| 3:10:27| Many, many other cities have done this quite successfully and they don't find that dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11427)|
| 3:10:31| get surrendered to their shelter. The last thing that I'll say is, just think of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11431)|
| 3:10:39| thing. I grew up in Georgia and we never went to the Atlanta Zoo. The Atlanta Zoo was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11439)|
| 3:10:44| embarrassment because of Willie B, the gorilla that was in a cage. That used to be what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11444)|
| 3:10:48| thought was a good standard in zoos. We kept animals behind bars. And then that zoo lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11448)|
| 3:10:54| its accreditation because it was so embarrassing and they fired their zoo director and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11454)|
| 3:10:59| changed their zoo enclosure later than many other zoos did. They were behind the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11459)|
| 3:11:04| They were pushing into the late 80s when they did that. We would never go back to doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11464)|
| 3:11:10| that. That's a cultural change, but all zoos used to do that across the board. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11470)|
| 3:11:15| what we're talking about is a cultural change. And we have organizations to support the cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11475)|
| 3:11:20| change. And we have experts in science that say this is a terrible idea and it breeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11480)|
| 3:11:26| aggressive dogs. So that's the difference in a change broken free dog and an enclosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11486)|

| 3:11:32| Thank you. Now, Council Member Singh and then you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11492)|
| 3:11:40| Thank you, Mayor. What keeps coming to my mind during this conversation is our noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11500)|
| 3:11:44| ordinances. I see a lot of similarity between complaint-driven items like this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11504)|
| 3:11:53| mainly complaint-based. Nobody's going to be roaming neighborhoods and checking to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11513)|
| 3:11:58| is your dog tethered or not. And I do know that people call the police if their neighbor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11518)|
| 3:12:03| vacuum cleaner is too loud. These things happen. But I think we put laws in place even if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11523)|
| 3:12:10| know that we're not going to catch everybody at that very moment. But a lot of times, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| so that we set standards on what we expect people to behave as. And we, having these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11534)|
| 3:12:21| laws in place, give people a, when they call, it will, people will look at it and see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11541)|
| 3:12:28| there is an issue or not. If we don't set our standards, we will never meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11548)|
| 3:12:32| Thank you. Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| Thank you. I have one quick question and it's probably for Chain Free. I know that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11556)|
| 3:12:43| talked about this before. About how many dogs do you think would be in this situation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11563)|
| 3:12:51| we would need fences for as you canvassed around? And I'm just kind of curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11571)|
| 3:12:58| how big a number, okay, several hundred, a thousand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11578)|
| 3:13:05| Does someone want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| There could be several hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11589)|
| 3:13:10| Probably several hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11590)|
| 3:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11591)|
| 3:13:12| Several hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11592)|
| 3:13:13| Right now, but if we don't pass it, there'll be more tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11593)|
| 3:13:16| Yeah, I'm not debating that with you. I'm just trying to figure out how many there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11596)|
| 3:13:21| And what I would say is, I mean, I appreciate we've had this conversation. You're offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11601)|
| 3:13:26| to pay for the chains. And what I will say is, as someone who runs an organization for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11606)|
| 3:13:32| girls, I have no doubt you can raise the money because as a country, we give more money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11612)|
| 3:13:40| animal welfare organizations than we do for girls. So I have no doubt if you say you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11620)|
| 3:13:49| raise this, you can raise this. I just kind of had to make that point because I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11629)|
| 3:13:55| that hurts my heart. I mean, I'm glad people are this passionate about animals, but I wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11635)|
| 3:14:03| we could get this much energy around empowering young girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11643)|
| 3:14:08| So the other question that I have is, I agree with Councilwoman saying that I don't expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11648)|
| 3:14:16| people to be riding around turning people in. And I could get there, but we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11656)|
| 3:14:27| do something in the ordinance, like Councilwoman Parker said, that does something about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11667)|
| 3:14:36| time limit that you can have a dog that you're not standing outside with them. That's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11676)|
| 3:14:44| hard. I mean, I know people are going to break it, but somebody could turn you in for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11684)|
| 3:14:49| watch you for a time, period. So, I mean, Councilwoman Parker talked about amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11689)|
| 3:14:55| that. Are you still considering that? Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| I don't want to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11701)|
| 3:15:02| Is that a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11702)|
| 3:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11703)|
| 3:15:04| Is that a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11704)|
| 3:15:05| If that's, was that a question, Ms. Fugate? Do you want her to propose it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11705)|
| 3:15:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11708)|
| 3:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11709)|
| 3:15:10| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11710)|
| 3:15:11| Okay. Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11711)|
| 3:15:18| I just have my amendments, and I haven't worked on this since December 6th, so I just looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11718)|
| 3:15:25| back at the one pertaining to the someone being outside, and it's something that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11725)|
| 3:15:33| to mind for me, but it's not the best. So I just, I want to offer this up, and I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11733)|
| 3:15:38| going to offer it as a motion. I'm just going to share the language and ask my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11738)|
| 3:15:44| hopefully, to engage in the discussion to see if you all think that this would address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11744)|
| 3:15:50| it. Let me get to it really quickly. So one idea is that we simply delete item, what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11750)|
| 3:16:04| this? 11, is that 11? 11C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11764)|
| 3:16:17| 12B or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| I'm sorry, 11C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| I mean 11. No, it's 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11781)|
| 3:16:24| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11784)|
| 3:16:25| Is it 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11785)|
| 3:16:26| The language you're proposing to delete is from which item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| Now, Ordinance 12C, Section 11C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11793)|
| 3:16:41| So I supervise my pets. If you get rid of 1, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11801)|
| 3:16:50| So the way I would read it is that supervision could be defined as being inside or outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11810)|
| 3:17:00| the house. There's someone on site caring for this animal. They've gone inside for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11820)|
| 3:17:10| few minutes, but the animal is still being supervised. But we're not giving such specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11830)|
| 3:17:16| definitions of they have to be outside an invisible range. That's one idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11836)|
| 3:17:24| I'm sorry, would you mind repeating what you were proposing to delete? Was it the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11844)|
| 3:17:29| Sub 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| The whole Sub 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11851)|
| 3:17:32| Or just words within Sub 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11852)|
| 3:17:33| The whole of 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11853)|
| 3:17:34| 11C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11854)|
| 3:17:35| Okay, got it. Thank you, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11857)|
| 3:17:38| The other suggestion is much more complicated. And it's the idea that if someone is not outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11858)|
| 3:17:54| with the pet, it gives reasonable suspicion for improper care. And so the language I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11874)|
| 3:18:02| up with was whenever any animal is tethered and the responsible and competent person is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11882)|
| 3:18:07| not outside an invisible range of the animal, it shall be the duty of the administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11887)|
| 3:18:13| or any animal control or police officer to inspect the premises and investigate the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11893)|
| 3:18:18| of care for the animal, including whether the animal is being supervised while tethered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11898)|
| 3:18:24| It's a lot of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11904)|
| 3:18:26| But trying to give some sort of opening to allow someone to let their animal outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11906)|
| 3:18:38| while inside the home and that still be considered supervised. Curious of folks' thoughts on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11918)|
| 3:18:49| how to handle that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11929)|
| 3:18:53| You had a lot of lights on. Does anyone want to respond to those particular proposed ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11933)|
| 3:19:01| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11941)|
| 3:19:02| I had a similar idea. Mine was around time because just saying line of sight or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11942)|
| 3:19:09| language you want to use from inside is unenforceable because somebody could always say I was watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11949)|
| 3:19:16| them, but they're not really. That's at least how it's expressed to me by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11956)|
| 3:19:23| So I think that a time-based thing theoretically works, but everything I've read from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11963)|
| 3:19:31| cities suggests that that's hard to enforce because an animal control officer has to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11971)|
| 3:19:36| there for that length of time. I don't think 15 minutes or 30 minutes is too much burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11976)|
| 3:19:44| but I also don't do this for a living. I don't have a good response to you. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11984)|
| 3:19:51| some thoughts I've had that are shared with you, but other thoughts that have been shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11991)|
| 3:19:55| with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11995)|
| 3:19:57| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11997)|
| 3:19:58| Thank you. I definitely want to thank Council Member Parker for putting that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=11998)|
| 3:20:03| out there about these different ideas for potential amendments. I think what was helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12003)|
| 3:20:10| for me was to go back and think about the workshop that we had back in February, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12010)|
| 3:20:15| one of the things that gave me some clarity about the enforcement piece, which I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12015)|
| 3:20:21| Council Member Fugate was talking about as well, was that in order for it to be enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12021)|
| 3:20:28| if you place a time limit, then what you're asking the animal control officer to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12028)|
| 3:20:33| respond and sit there. So if you ask them to sit there for five minutes or two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12033)|
| 3:20:40| that's five minutes or two hours that the animal control officer can't respond to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12040)|
| 3:20:45| call. So when we were talking with, I think it was Captain Jones, in the workshop, his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12045)|
| 3:20:51| response was, hey, please, make it clear. I need to know what, when I get on the scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12051)|
| 3:20:59| whatever your language you write, I need to be able to know what it is when I see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12059)|
| 3:21:03| and move forward from an enforcement perspective. So I get the idea about, is there some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12063)|
| 3:21:10| we can do a time limit? Also, we've seen other cities that have done, hey, not a 15-minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12070)|
| 3:21:17| limit or something like that, but, you know, well, in these certain weather conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12077)|
| 3:21:21| it's okay. And at this time of day, like from 11 to 7 or whatever time you wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12081)|
| 3:21:27| well, that's enforceable. But then you got to think about whether that is useful. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12087)|
| 3:21:32| that was another question that was asked during the workshop. And what we found out was, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12092)|
| 3:21:37| you think about the health of an animal, the breed, the age of an animal, there's no safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12097)|
| 3:21:45| condition for an animal to be outside all the time. So we can't arbitrarily say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12105)|
| 3:21:50| if the weather is like this, then it's okay. It may not be okay for all animals. So thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12110)|
| 3:21:56| about enforcement, I think, is important. I think the other one I missed was maybe reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12116)|
| 3:22:05| this after a period of time. I think that's a great idea, too. I don't know that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12125)|
| 3:22:10| to put it in the ordinance, because if it's not working, we're going to hear about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12130)|
| 3:22:14| and we're going to take action. And so, you know, I have, I guess, some other thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12134)|
| 3:22:20| about this as well, but, you know, we're addressing these particular items. I think it's great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12140)|
| 3:22:25| to come up with them. I think it's a great part of the discussion. I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12145)|
| 3:22:28| I'm going to support any of them, because I don't know if they're going to be enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12148)|
| 3:22:31| and I don't know if they're going to really help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12151)|
| 3:22:36| Who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12156)|
| 3:22:38| Well, I was going to comment on the conversation about changing language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12158)|
| 3:22:42| Sure, Ms. Reiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12162)|
| 3:22:44| I think the issue was, you can say the dog was within visual range through the window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12164)|
| 3:22:49| 24-7, and then you wind up again with a chronically tethered dog. You can be asleep and be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12169)|
| 3:22:55| yeah, there it is right outside the window. The state of Pennsylvania and many of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12175)|
| 3:23:00| municipalities seem to love the language. Now, again, they have a different set of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12180)|
| 3:23:04| laws than we do, but they seem to love the language, a dog can be tethered while the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12184)|
| 3:23:10| owner completes a temporary task. But then it gets to how do you define a temporary task?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12190)|
| 3:23:18| So, just like many of our other ordinances, there's kind of some reasonable expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12198)|
| 3:23:30| of enforcement here that's not ridiculous. And we're not talking about, Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12210)|
| 3:23:38| Testerman has pointed this out, this is a small piece of the pie. There's many other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12218)|
| 3:23:43| issues that have nothing to do with this tethering issue. There's a small number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| dogs that are living on chains that we're talking about. And what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12227)|
| 3:23:51| is creating legislation that works hand in glove with our boots on the ground, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| volunteers that are out there working to change the culture. So, just no matter what we change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12236)|
| 3:24:03| the language to, we wind up with enforcement issues, which is why there was so much deliberative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12243)|
| 3:24:09| time spent talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12249)|
| 3:24:16| Ms. Singh, were you, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| Thank you. I'm wondering if this is something, I know this has been worked on for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12259)|
| 3:24:24| but I'm wondering if this is something that we can complete tonight. I like some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12264)|
| 3:24:28| language, the changes and the suggestions that are made, but I don't know if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12268)|
| 3:24:35| complete that tonight. So, I'm wondering how are we going to move forward with voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12275)|
| 3:24:42| on one or the other or, I'm asking my colleagues, or do we want to make a decision to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12282)|
| 3:24:49| this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12289)|
| 3:24:53| Say, why don't we finish the debate and then we can talk about how to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12293)|
| 3:24:56| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12296)|
| 3:24:57| Why don't we finish the debate and then we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| Oh, I'm just ready to call the question one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12302)|
| 3:25:03| I've got a final thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12303)|
| 3:25:04| I'm still waiting to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12304)|
| 3:25:05| Oh, okay. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12305)|
| 3:25:08| Well, I think Council Member Testerman's light's been on longer than mine has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12308)|
| 3:25:13| Okay. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| I just got a quick thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| You want to go with the final? All right. I mean, I think what I was going to say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12317)|
| 3:25:21| you know, there's, the times we live on are focused a lot on the things that divide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12321)|
| 3:25:26| You know, I think we've all seen that in a lot of different ways. But, and I'm under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12326)|
| 3:25:31| no illusion that at the end of this discussion, one of these items is going to get more votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12331)|
| 3:25:35| than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12335)|
| 3:25:36| But I think what you're really seeing is that there's a win for animals in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12336)|
| 3:25:42| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12342)|
| 3:25:43| No matter what choice is made, we have an animal control board that has worked really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12343)|
| 3:25:50| hard on updating needed requirements for the care of animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12350)|
| 3:25:55| That's a win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| We have a wonderful group of neighbors and grassroots organization in Knoxville Animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12357)|
| 3:26:03| Welfare Alliance and Chain Free Knoxville who've been providing free fencing for folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12363)|
| 3:26:09| who've been advocating for good reforms for making sure we're being safe for our animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12369)|
| 3:26:16| I mean, that's another win, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12376)|
| 3:26:18| But then if you look at what's going on in this, wait, I got to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12378)|
| 3:26:24| I had moved my things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12384)|
| 3:26:27| If you go back and look at the language in here, there's stuff in here, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12387)|
| 3:26:32| we should have done this a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12392)|
| 3:26:34| Look at what one of the replacements is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12394)|
| 3:26:36| It shall be unlawful for any person keeping an animal to fail to provide for that animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12396)|
| 3:26:41| clean, sanitary and humane conditions or provide the minimum care sufficient to preserve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12401)|
| 3:26:46| health and well-being of the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12406)|
| 3:26:47| That's in both of these, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12407)|
| 3:26:50| Then, I mean, this is just a quick scroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| Immediate veterinary care shall be administered to relieve distress from injury of neglect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12412)|
| 3:26:56| or disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12416)|
| 3:26:57| Adequate space for exercise needs to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12417)|
| 3:27:01| Bringing the animal indoors during period of extreme weather and it goes to define what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12421)|
| 3:27:05| those things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12425)|
| 3:27:06| Those are in both of these two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12426)|
| 3:27:10| So I think this is really a good place that we find ourselves having this debate tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12430)|
| 3:27:17| I went back and I thought a lot about what we had discussions about in February when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12437)|
| 3:27:21| we had council's workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| And, you know, what other things that we heard were that, you know, a dog that's tethered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12443)|
| 3:27:29| and unsupervised is an easy target for other animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12449)|
| 3:27:34| You have the same thing we heard tonight about, you know, you can have more litters because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12454)|
| 3:27:40| the dog can't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12460)|
| 3:27:42| There was discussion from the animal control officers as well as folks that were in attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12462)|
| 3:27:48| that night talking about, you know, dogs are social animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12468)|
| 3:27:51| And when you remove them from a social environment and you, and they're chained up, well, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12471)|
| 3:27:58| have a flight or flight reflex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12478)|
| 3:28:00| You get rid of the flight, then they're going to go to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12480)|
| 3:28:03| And so, they're seeing more aggression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12483)|
| 3:28:06| I, looking at the change that we're looking at tonight too, with regard to the pulley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12486)|
| 3:28:11| system, I mean, I did the same thing that the young man did that came up and showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12491)|
| 3:28:16| the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12496)|
| 3:28:17| They looked at the warnings and they said, don't leave your animal unsupervised using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12497)|
| 3:28:21| this product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12501)|
| 3:28:24| You know, Knoxville, I think, is a welcoming community and we work really hard every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12504)|
| 3:28:29| to be welcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12509)|
| 3:28:30| I think we are welcoming for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| We need to be welcoming for animals too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12512)|
| 3:28:34| This is a really good first step in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12514)|
| 3:28:38| I don't know that we need to make any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12518)|
| 3:28:41| I'm in support of item 12C because I don't see any way you can, you got to have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12521)|
| 3:28:48| that's enforceable and this is enforceable and it sets the right tone for the kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12528)|
| 3:28:53| community we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12533)|
| 3:28:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12534)|
| 3:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12535)|
| 3:28:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12536)|
| 3:29:03| Council Member Parker, your light's not, your light's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12543)|
| 3:29:08| Yeah, I do think the ordinance needs an amendment to have a review because there's been a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12548)|
| 3:29:19| of concerns raised about the impact of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12559)|
| 3:29:28| So, I beg your pardon for interrupting you, but could I throw out there an option that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12568)|
| 3:29:41| you may or may not want to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12583)|
| 3:29:44| Which is, this is on first reading, so you may or may not vote on one tonight, but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12584)|

| 3:29:57| You could prepare motions to amend that you believe appropriate based on the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12597)|
| 3:30:04| gets adopted and bring those back to the second reading and then you all could vote on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12604)|
| 3:30:12| proposed amendments to it, either serially or all at once or however you decide to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12612)|
| 3:30:20| If you adopt some significant amendments that will kick it back to first reading, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12620)|
| 3:30:27| can cure that if people are pretty much in agreement by simply passing it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12627)|
| 3:30:33| So, that doesn't mean that it's going to have to come back two more times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| It may only have to come back one time if there's enough agreement about it that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12637)|
| 3:30:42| can do it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12642)|
| 3:30:43| And that's just something I want to throw out to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| People are ready to go, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12645)|
| 3:30:50| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12650)|
| 3:30:52| I can do that compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| I have some hesitancy, but I am open to that compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12654)|
| 3:31:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12664)|
| 3:31:06| Councilmember Ryder and then Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12666)|
| 3:31:10| I'm going to decide to not say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12670)|
| 3:31:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12675)|
| 3:31:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| Just in conclusion, I mean, first I'll go back to the product liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12678)|
| 3:31:23| I mean, this water bottle has product liability attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12683)|
| 3:31:27| I mean, everything does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| And there will always be bad actors and people who don't care about their animals, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12689)|
| 3:31:34| vast majority love their animals and we can't create policy for the small percentage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12694)|
| 3:31:39| ill-intentioned people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| And when those cruelty and neglect cases happen, we have state laws already on the books to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12701)|
| 3:31:46| support and prosecute those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12706)|
| 3:31:50| We all can't dictate our standards and norms on others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12710)|
| 3:31:54| Of course I want to see pets inside, curled up on the sofa, sleeping in the bed, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12714)|
| 3:32:00| all have different experiences and realities that don't equate with everyone else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12720)|
| 3:32:06| That's why I go back to why the dialogue can't just be about the pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12726)|
| 3:32:10| It has to be about the pet owner and it has to be broader in that human-animal bond that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12730)|
| 3:32:17| is so important across every socioeconomic, cultural, and racial boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12737)|
| 3:32:22| This must be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12742)|
| 3:32:25| As I've said repeatedly, the issue is access to resources and because these pets are outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12745)|
| 3:32:30| it doesn't mean pet owners love their pet any less than you do or that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12750)|
| 3:32:36| We need to continue to education and outreach and as a community, if we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12756)|
| 3:32:40| theoretically, we don't need a mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12760)|
| 3:32:43| We've had to shift the dialogue around animal welfare to include the owner, which has been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12763)|
| 3:32:48| lesson I've learned over the last decade of being in this business and precisely why Young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12768)|
| 3:32:53| Williams established the Pet Resource Center so we can create that two-way conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12773)|
| 3:32:58| with owners opposed to teaching them that we are a dumping ground for animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12778)|
| 3:33:03| I spent six and a half years doing a culture change in this community with an amazing team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12783)|
| 3:33:12| Take owners' surrenders for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12792)|
| 3:33:14| We know more than 40% of people don't want to surrender a pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12794)|
| 3:33:18| They just don't know that options exist to keep pets with their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12798)|
| 3:33:22| This is a huge need we're working to address and this ordinance and elevating the standards of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12802)|
| 3:33:26| care plays intimately into the scenarios we see every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12806)|
| 3:33:30| This includes working with landlords to provide more pet-friendly housing, providing training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12810)|
| 3:33:35| resources so pet owners can leave a pet outside or if a pet is restricted to living outside that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12815)|
| 3:33:41| we're ensuring those pets have warm, dry housing, pet food, dog bowls, proper leashes and collars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12821)|
| 3:33:48| And yes, we have helped owners fix their fences as well because in a perfect world, we would love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12828)|
| 3:33:54| to not have dogs on the tether but until we need, until then, we need to ensure there's every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12834)|
| 3:34:00| possible option in tandem with the highest standards so no one is excluded from the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12840)|
| 3:34:06| of having a pet and enjoying a pet, enjoying all a pet brings to people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12846)|
| 3:34:12| This is what I wake up to every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| It's what our team of nearly a hundred wake up and do in giving every animal the best chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12854)|
| 3:34:22| for living a loving, healthy and happy life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12862)|
| 3:34:26| As far as amendments are concerned, I mean, this may or may not fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12866)|
| 3:34:31| I mean, I would be willing to, there is someone who's a humane investigator, a humane ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12871)|
| 3:34:38| consultant who would be willing to help revise and come up with amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12878)|
| 3:34:44| He's also a former animal control officer in multiple jurisdictions so I'll throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12884)|
| 3:34:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12891)|

| 3:34:57| As Council Member Singh had asked, we have two versions in front of us and we need a path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12897)|
| 3:35:04| So what I'm going to suggest we do and I'll make a motion to table item 12B and that way we can vote on 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12904)|
| 3:35:14| And that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12914)|

| 3:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12956)|
| 3:35:57| So there are amendments that need to be made to item 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12957)|
| 3:36:00| These are Scribner's errors, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12960)|
| 3:36:03| Council Member Ryder, do you want to make those motions or do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12963)|
| 3:36:07| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12967)|
| 3:36:08| Why don't you do it by second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12968)|
| 3:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12970)|
| 3:36:11| So second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12971)|
| 3:36:12| Second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12972)|
| 3:36:14| If it's just Scribner's not substantive, can it wait until second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12974)|
| 3:36:17| That's a Swanson question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12977)|
| 3:36:18| I'm being advised that it can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12978)|
| 3:36:20| It can wait and then everyone gets a copy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12980)|
| 3:36:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=12983)|

| 3:43:45| caring for children who had to be removed from their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13425)|

| 3:48:41| I fell through, and I got me a case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13721)|
| 3:48:43| Well, that ended up being a lot more than what it should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13723)|

| 3:49:06| good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13746)|

| 3:49:24| Well, as that's going along, he wanted to put us in a motel about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13764)|
| 3:49:29| a month later to benefit us, saying it would help us get into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13769)|

| 3:49:38| and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13778)|
| 3:49:39| But we didn't really think about the outcome of what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13779)|

| 3:49:53| They stuck us in a motel, Motel 6 to be exact, for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13793)|
| 3:49:59| I had a heart attack right before that, before we went to the motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13799)|
| 3:50:03| So I was struggling even more now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13803)|
| 3:50:05| So now I'm not just homeless and lost my house and my car, but my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13805)|
| 3:50:09| fiancee is struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13809)|
| 3:50:10| She's having a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13810)|
| 3:50:11| We can't get on our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13811)|
| 3:50:13| So as it goes on, we're trying to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13813)|
| 3:50:17| We're calling places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13817)|
| 3:50:18| We're getting resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13818)|
| 3:50:19| Some places are responding to our calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13819)|
| 3:50:22| So anyways, as the more resources I get, they keep telling us to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13822)|
| 3:50:27| CAC and this place and this place, that they are the main directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13827)|
| 3:50:31| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13831)|
| 3:50:33| So that's what I did for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| Well, my case manager quit coming around for about a month and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13835)|
| 3:50:40| and I started getting sick and no phone calls, no nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13840)|
| 3:50:44| and it got even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13844)|
| 3:50:46| I didn't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13846)|
| 3:50:48| I had three months to figure out what I was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13848)|
| 3:50:51| I'm getting my Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13851)|
| 3:50:53| I'm waiting for a decision for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13853)|
| 3:50:56| And we were getting to the point line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13856)|
| 3:50:58| I didn't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13858)|
| 3:50:59| I tried to talk to the managers at CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13859)|
| 3:51:02| I did it by the protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13862)|
| 3:51:03| I went and talked to my case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| He wouldn't fix anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| It got worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13867)|
| 3:51:08| So I went to his boss, talked to them, and went to her boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13868)|
| 3:51:12| Everything kind of picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13872)|
| 3:51:13| The day I talked to her, for about two days, things started to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13873)|
| 3:51:17| He was coming by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13877)|
| 3:51:18| He was starting to help more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13878)|
| 3:51:20| I was getting everything I needed to get back on my feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13880)|
| 3:51:23| So, anyways, after all that, it got to the point to where he just pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13883)|
| 3:51:29| called me within two or three days ago stating that he wasn't going to help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13889)|
| 3:51:35| that we had to go to shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13895)|
| 3:51:37| I called these shelters multiple times to see if we could get a place to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13897)|
| 3:51:41| because of my circumstances with the heart attack and being a diabetic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13901)|
| 3:51:45| they didn't want me at these shelters due to my health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13905)|
| 3:51:49| So I kept telling him that with all the paperwork and text messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13909)|
| 3:51:54| and phone calls, the proof is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13914)|
| 3:51:57| But where I'm getting at with all this is we were badly treated through CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13917)|
| 3:52:04| and I tried to do everything in my power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13924)|
| 3:52:07| To this day, I still try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13927)|
| 3:52:10| And I don't know where to go from it because I'm originally from Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13930)|
| 3:52:15| and down there we would figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13935)|
| 3:52:18| It would be settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13938)|
| 3:52:19| But I've tried everything in my book by doing it by code, by this person, by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13939)|
| 3:52:25| I don't know anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| I don't know who I can go to to at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13947)|
| 3:52:29| And it ain't just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13949)|
| 3:52:31| We were at Motel 6 for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13951)|
| 3:52:33| The day we got kicked out was the 31st of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13953)|
| 3:52:36| There was over 13 to 14 people that got kicked out with us, elderly people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13956)|
| 3:52:41| My mother-in-law is 71 and has to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13961)|
| 3:52:46| She stays at Kenan Grimes Community Outreach Center, which is a homeless shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13966)|
| 3:52:53| And I don't think that's right for an elderly person that's been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13973)|
| 3:52:58| that struggles, that has Social Security and SSI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13978)|
| 3:53:02| Thank you, Mr. Strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13982)|
| 3:53:04| That's your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13984)|
| 3:53:05| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=13985)|

| 3:53:21| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14001)|
| 3:53:24| It's Leslie Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14004)|

| 3:53:34| Just like he said, CAC, they pick and choose who they want to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14014)|
| 3:53:39| It's like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14019)|
| 3:53:40| I'm 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14020)|
| 3:53:42| I've got three valves bad in my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14022)|
| 3:53:44| I can't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14024)|
| 3:53:45| And they're telling me I need to get out and find me a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14025)|
| 3:53:49| And I've got doctors telling them that I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14029)|
| 3:53:52| And my 71-year-old mother is with me at Kenan Grimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14032)|
| 3:53:56| But, yeah, they pick and choose who they want to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14036)|
| 3:53:59| They don't care what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14039)|
| 3:54:01| It's like this person, they'll help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14041)|
| 3:54:04| This person, they choose to throw them out on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14044)|
| 3:54:07| And it's not really that fair or right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14047)|
| 3:54:09| I think they should help any and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14049)|
| 3:54:15| That's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14055)|
| 3:54:18| I don't know what else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14058)|
| 3:54:21| I'm homeless because of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| I had two jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14063)|
| 3:54:24| And they said if I had a job, it would help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14064)|
| 3:54:27| I had two jobs, working at Needham and at KFC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14067)|
| 3:54:31| They moved me to Motel 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14071)|
| 3:54:32| I lost both jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14072)|
| 3:54:34| I couldn't work no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14074)|
| 3:54:37| So I don't know what else to do other than try to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14077)|
| 3:54:40| And they won't help nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14080)|
| 3:54:41| They pick and choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14081)|
| 3:54:44| That's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14084)|
| 3:54:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14086)|
| 3:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14087)|
| 3:54:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14088)|
| 3:54:49| Council members, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14089)|
| 3:54:54| So unless there's an objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14094)|
| 3:54:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=14097)|
