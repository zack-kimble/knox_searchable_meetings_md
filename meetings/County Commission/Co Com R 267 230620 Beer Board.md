|     784 |   785 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=784.0)  |
|     785 |   789 | It's like the grocery stores and gas stations.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=785.0)  |
|     789 |   790 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=789.0)  |

|     794 |   799 | But if it's like a restaurant or an in-skip grill,                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=794.0)  |
|     799 |   802 | then the Health Department does that.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=799.0)  |
|     802 |   803 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=802.0)  |
|     803 |   808 | And the reason is the state had allowed the Health Department with                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=803.0)  |

|     847 |   852 | and it's just a letter that they send to the customer which states                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=847.0)  |

|    2636 |  2640 | and let's look at the charges associated with them, and then let's single this one out there.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2636.0) |
|    2640 |  2645 | Let's do that, but let's drag them all down there and have a full hearing associated with it.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2640.0) |
|    2645 |  2649 | So that being said, we were invited down here, and that's why I prefaced my correspondence                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2645.0) |
|    2649 |  2654 | that I attached in your packets with the fact that we're invited down here to a discussion.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2649.0) |
|    2654 |  2657 | I didn't think we were basically coming to a situation of a lynching,                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2654.0) |
|    2657 |  2661 | and that's basically what I feel we're facing with regards to it.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2657.0) |
|    2661 |  2665 | We've got a business that's bending over backwards trying to take action,                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2661.0) |
|    2665 |  2669 | trying to police, trying to do what's there.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2665.0) |
|    2669 |  2673 | We've asked local law enforcement that are serving in other bars and other establishments                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2669.0) |
|    2673 |  2677 | across the county and across the city, and they won't come there,                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2673.0) |
|    2677 |  2680 | but yet we're going to be vilified associated with it.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2677.0) |
|    2680 |  2682 | So that's what my issue is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2680.0) |
|    2682 |  2685 | So if we're going to have a full-blown hearing, let's have a full-blown hearing,                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2682.0) |
|    2686 |  2691 | but not take just arbitrary and capricious action with regards to what I consider to be the lifeline                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2686.0) |
|    2691 |  2694 | to this business as far as their license.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2691.0) |

|    2698 |  2702 | but that causes me really particular grave concern                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2698.0) |
|    2702 |  2705 | because we have just these broad allegations relative to it.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2702.0) |

|    2745 |  2750 | I think this board is about basically according due process to everyone that comes before it,                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2745.0) |
|    2750 |  2754 | and I don't think El Tequila is getting due process under the circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2750.0) |

|    2868 |  2876 | that if you don't have direct notice of what the incident is that results in the revocation,                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2868.0) |
|    2876 |  2884 | that can be a reason to suspend if you wanted to act out of an abundance of caution.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2876.0) |
|    2884 |  2888 | You could re-notice this and say it's for this incident.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2884.0) |
|    2888 |  2893 | But honestly, I don't think there's anybody in this room.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2888.0) |
|    2893 |  2898 | It's clear that Mr. Jones knew what he was going to be talking about when he came here.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2893.0) |
|    2898 |  2906 | I think everybody knew that we were going to be primarily focused on this May 7th incident.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2898.0) |
|    2906 |  2911 | At the end of the day, is that enough for a court to uphold it?                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2906.0) |
|    2911 |  2913 | We'd have to see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2911.0) |
|    2913 |  2915 | But we do have sworn testimony.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2913.0) |
|    2915 |  2923 | We really don't have a denial that the fight and the shooting took place on or near the premises.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2915.0) |
|    2923 |  2933 | We have a list of prior incidences that have occurred that have been placed in our record before.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2923.0) |
|    2933 |  2941 | So as far as due process, I think due process has been served.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2933.0) |
|    2941 |  2943 | Is there enough in the record?                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2941.0) |
|    2943 |  2944 | That remains to be seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2943.0) |
|    2944 |  2947 | I'd have to, you know, we'd put it in front of a judge                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2944.0) |
|    2947 |  2950 | and the judge would have to determine whether there's sufficient evidence.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2947.0) |
|    2950 |  2954 | So I would say that it's a pretty high bar.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2950.0) |
|    2954 |  2960 | Like I said, the court can't look at what you did and decide what you did is right or wrong.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2954.0) |
|    2960 |  2962 | That's not the court's role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2960.0) |
|    2962 |  2967 | The court's role is to determine did you have a rational basis for what you did?                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2962.0) |
|    2967 |  2970 | Did you have material evidence to support what you did?                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2967.0) |
|    2970 |  2976 | And if the court finds that you did, then generally the court has no choice but to uphold what you did.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2970.0) |
|    2976 |  2983 | So that's my best statement of law and how the review would go if there's a review.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2976.0) |

|    2986 |  2995 | Well, I will say that I do not want this kind of activity going on in halls, but I do agree with Mr. Jones.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2986.0) |

|    3007 |  3013 | The only thing that we know for sure is that there was a shooting and that person has pled guilty to it,                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3007.0) |

|    3020 |  3027 | And I think, I mean, I'm a constitutional person, and I think they're entitled to due process,                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3020.0) |
|    3027 |  3032 | and I do not feel that they've had an adequate hearing to address these things,                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3027.0) |
|    3032 |  3040 | and I would make a motion that we set this for hearing if we're going to do any kind of action like that.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3032.0) |
|    3040 |  3049 | We have a motion on the floor. Is there a second?                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3040.0) |
|    3049 |  3053 | Motion by Lee, second by Durrett.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3049.0) |

|    3056 |  3058 | I did have a comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3056.0) |
|    3058 |  3069 | I have to say I feel like that, and I'm not an attorney, so I'm just coming at it as a layperson, obviously,                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3058.0) |
|    3069 |  3074 | but in my opinion, I believe this restaurant, we have given more than due process.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3069.0) |
|    3074 |  3077 | They've been in front of us numerous times.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3074.0) |
|    3077 |  3085 | I believe the sheriff's office has offered us ample information and opportunity to know what's going on in that business.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3077.0) |
|    3085 |  3088 | As somebody also said, they haven't denied it.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3085.0) |
|    3088 |  3096 | We even, because they had gotten an attorney prior to you, Mr. Jones, that came before us,                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3088.0) |
|    3096 |  3100 | and he said he had just gotten the case and he didn't have time for it,                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3096.0) |
|    3100 |  3104 | and we felt like that was due process, that we needed to give him more time to do that.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3100.0) |
|    3104 |  3107 | And then in the meantime, we're having all of these issues coming up,                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3104.0) |
|    3107 |  3111 | so I'm not even bringing up the rape or any of the other stuff.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3107.0) |
|    3111 |  3117 | I'm bringing up that there are problems at this business, there continues to be problems at this business,                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3111.0) |
|    3117 |  3124 | but if you as their attorney are saying it's like a driver's license and it's a privilege to have,                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3117.0) |
|    3124 |  3130 | we as this board, I mean, I believe that I can say I have heard from this restaurant                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3124.0) |
|    3130 |  3136 | more than I've heard from any other restaurant in Knox County since I've been sitting on this board.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3130.0) |
|    3136 |  3140 | And in my opinion, I feel like that this board has done due process.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3136.0) |

|    3151 |  3157 | Mr. Moyers, if this vote were to pass,                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3151.0) |
|    3157 |  3165 | can you explain what a hearing at this beer ward might look like and how that process might work?                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3157.0) |
|    3165 |  3178 | Well, I suppose you would take the evidence from our beer board inspector from the Sheriff's Department,                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3165.0) |
|    3178 |  3187 | would present all of the incidences that he alleges are associated with the operation of this restaurant                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3178.0) |

|    3202 |  3208 | He could present his own witnesses in rebuttal.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3202.0) |
|    3208 |  3216 | And at the close of that, we would have a pretty solid record to send to a court                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3208.0) |
|    3216 |  3220 | if the board decided to take action on the lawsuit.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3216.0) |
|    3220 |  3227 | It would be probably a more solid record than we have heretofore.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3220.0) |
|    3227 |  3233 | It is to be noted that generally speaking, in writ of certiorari cases,                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3227.0) |
|    3233 |  3237 | no evidence can be introduced at the trial.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3233.0) |
|    3237 |  3248 | So if all we have from the Sheriff's Department is our inspector's oral relation of the incidences                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3237.0) |
|    3248 |  3256 | that are alleged to have occurred at the bar, I cannot flush that out at court, at trial.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3248.0) |
|    3256 |  3259 | You can't add to the record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3256.0) |
|    3259 |  3263 | A certiorari action is a review of the record.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3259.0) |
|    3263 |  3268 | Similarly, Mr. Jones could not bring witnesses to testify at a trial.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3263.0) |
|    3268 |  3275 | So if you do something today, then what we have today is what we're stuck with when we get to court.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3268.0) |
|    3275 |  3279 | If you give them a hearing, it will give both sides a greater opportunity                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3275.0) |
|    3279 |  3287 | to flush out the evidence for and against some punitive action against this license,                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3279.0) |
|    3287 |  3290 | and that's what would go to the court.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3287.0) |
|    3291 |  3299 | So if you feel like there's enough, then you can take action.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3291.0) |
|    3299 |  3303 | If you feel like you want the opportunity to get a bit more evidence in the record,                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3299.0) |
|    3303 |  3309 | to give the court a bit more to hang their hat on, then you can do that as well.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3303.0) |
|    3311 |  3318 | If the court were to find that there weren't sufficient evidence,                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3311.0) |
|    3318 |  3323 | then this body could then hold the hearing and take another action if it wished,                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3318.0) |
|    3323 |  3328 | because it's not a finding on certiorari, it's not a finding that the board acted improperly,                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3323.0) |
|    3328 |  3333 | although it tends to get couched in terms of arbitrary, capricious, and illegal.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3328.0) |
|    3333 |  3340 | What that really means is there wasn't sufficient evidence to support what the body did.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3333.0) |
|    3340 |  3342 | So that's where we are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3340.0) |
|    3342 |  3345 | If you're comfortable with the state of the evidence,                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3342.0) |
|    3345 |  3351 | if you're comfortable putting that in front of a judge, then you can act, I think.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3345.0) |
|    3351 |  3356 | If you'd like to put more in front of the court for the court's consideration,                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3351.0) |
|    3356 |  3360 | then you could have another hearing and have that opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3356.0) |

|    3370 |  3375 | Just a thought, if Commissioner Lee's motion were to pass,                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3370.0) |
|    3375 |  3382 | I might suggest that we do such a hearing by special call meeting of the beer board                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3375.0) |

|    3387 |  3389 | Just a thought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3387.0) |
|    3393 |  3398 | I'm listening to all this, and I've been here for all this just like you guys have.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3393.0) |

|    3424 |  3429 | But I do tend to trust her ear on this because I'm not an attorney, but she is.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3424.0) |

|    3635 |  3640 | suspended for 60 days that they were good as gold?                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3635.0) |
|    3640 |  3644 | It was initially suspended for 30 and then the beer board extended it for another 60 days,                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3640.0) |
|    3644 |  3646 | so it was a total of 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3644.0) |

|    3676 |  3685 | I also believe in due process, so I have no problem voting yes for giving them a hearing of sorts.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3676.0) |
|    3685 |  3692 | If we are, I think we should continue the suspension of the license until that hearing.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3685.0) |

|    3708 |  3721 | I'd just ask the maker of the motion to maybe put a specific timeframe on the motion so we can have some direction of how long everybody would have to prepare if it were to be approved.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3708.0) |

|    3788 |  3794 | I would just say that I don't know what 60 days, where it puts us.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3788.0) |
|    3794 |  3802 | I think you might want to actually have a date and time certain that you set it to.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3794.0) |
|    3802 |  3808 | If the beer board chairman wants to set that, that's fine.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3802.0) |
|    3808 |  3814 | If we do 60 days thinking that we're going to be on this day two months from now,                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3808.0) |
|    3814 |  3817 | we have meetings that start at 2 and 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3814.0) |
|    3817 |  3819 | Like today there were meetings at 12 and at 2.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3817.0) |
|    3819 |  3825 | So I think you need to find a time where you have an hour or two free to do this.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3819.0) |
