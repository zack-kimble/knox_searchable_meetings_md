| 0:00:00| If we could go ahead and start finding our seats, it's 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=0)|
| 0:00:20| I'd like to welcome everybody to a full and fun day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20)|
| 0:00:48| I would like to open the meeting with a moment of silence for all the folks in Oklahoma that are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=48)|
| 0:01:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| I don't really have a lot of opening comments other than I just appreciate all the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| I know that the administration and the mayor's office has done to put this budget together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| I said at the budget luncheon I was very pleased with what was brought forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| and look forward to a good day of dialogue, perhaps robust dialogue at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| But anyway, with that, I will go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=93)|
| 0:01:41| And I'll just say, as we know, this is going to be one day instead of a day and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| so let's stay on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Everybody comment, but let's make good use of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| So with that, I'll turn it over to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| We're very pleased to be here today to present the 2013 and 2014 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| and encourage you to not pick it apart, but lovingly question and analyze it very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| which we encourage you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Now, you didn't pick as exciting a venue as I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| I mean, I don't see anybody rappelling or paddling or mountain biking, no zoo animals involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| Still early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| But I'm sure you will still see that it is a very good and solid budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| As I mentioned on the day of the budget luncheon, it holds the line on operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| because our revenues are pretty much holding the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| but we're going to continue to provide excellent services to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| And this is because we have really excellent management from our department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| and discipline from our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| As I mentioned at the address, we are a service organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| so we continue to invest in our workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| because we can only be as good as the quality and the experience of our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| While we're holding the line on operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| we are investing a total of $50 million in capital, including the $31.4 million in new debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| My predecessors, Mayor Haslam, now governor, and Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| they were wise to continue to invest in our infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| and leverage the private investment even during the worst of the recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| And as we are coming out of the recession, we see the results from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| So much private investment downtown, along Cumberland Avenue, University Commons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| and more announcements coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| So we know that that was a wise strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| So my proposed capital investments will continue to maintain our infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| like the roads, bridges, and sidewalks, and we'll build more sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| improve traffic signalization, enhance our energy efficiency and sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| just to name a few items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| We'll enhance two major city assets, the Lakeshore Park and the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| and position ourselves to leverage private dollars to further enhance both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| So as I said that day, this is not really just about numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| It's about a vision for the future of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| It's about where we want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and it's based on things that I heard from you all over the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| the things that I said when I was running for mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| and what we continue to hear from our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| I think we know who we are and what we want to be here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| and this is about making that happen each year with how we allocate our dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| It is affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| It's forward-thinking, and it doesn't include a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| So I'm really happy to answer any questions you might have for me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| I will be leaving, and then I'll join you again for lunch at the Roundup in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| But meanwhile, our deputies to the mayor, Bill Lyons and Eddie Maness, will be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| and of course our senior director of finance, Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| and then other department heads will be coming in all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| So do you all have any questions for me as we get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| Let's take advantage of you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| Could you spend just a minute talking about the zoo investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| Because I've heard comments both ways about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| and I'm just trying to understand exactly what we're doing and what we hope to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| and to kind of get the feel of the approach there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| You know, we have a really great zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| It's a huge economic generator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| I don't have all the numbers in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| I mentioned some of those that day at the budget address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| But we know that not only is it a great asset for us who live in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| but it does bring in people, tourists from around the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| which is a good economic generator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| I think it's one of the top 20 venues in the state in terms of tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| So we have a zoo board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| Eddie is on that as well as Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| The zoo board has been very, again, forward-thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| and having a long-range capital plan, a plan for a major investment there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| for the Malayan tigers and reptiles and amphibians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| In fact, I think we're in danger maybe of losing accreditation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| if we don't improve that soon on that particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| And we've got a wonderful collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| We can't even exhibit all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Also, the Kids' Cove area could use further enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| So instead, we already have a contract with the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| in which we put so much in per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| A million and a half or something a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Plus we put in $750,000 in capital improvements every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| So what the zoo did was come to us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| why don't you front load that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| We've got $15 million plus plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| They asked us really, I think, for $15 million, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| And we said we would propose coming up with $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| You leverage the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| You can do it while money is still cheap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| and construction is still very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| Let's go ahead and make those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Let's do those projects now instead of piecemealing them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| over the next 10 to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Do them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| And we thought that that made a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| We can borrow money cheaper than they can as a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| And it just seemed to make good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Plus they will leverage the private dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| You'll get the tax-free municipal rate, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| for the people who lend you the money, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| And so that's why we're bringing that to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| Let's front load it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| We're coming out of this recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| People are investing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| We see it all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Let's make this investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| And then we'll see the returns for years to come on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Along that same line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| I mean, that's the one big thing that's in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| is the bond issue and the $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| And I'm certainly not opposed to that strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| And I think it's a good strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| I think you're right on that you can borrow money right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| better at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| I guess what I want to hear today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| is why we think these projects that you put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| and the zoo and the others are the most critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| to the next, whatever, five years for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| And I guess that's what we're going to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| And really what I'm going to ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| I'm not opposed to borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| You are borrowing the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| We're borrowing $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| I mean, are those the most critical projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| for the city of Knoxville for the next five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| And I guess you all think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| And I guess I want to hear why you think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| And I guess that's what we're going to debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| or at least talk about, lovingly discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| Lovingly discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| You guys have put the time and the effort into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| And I guess that's what I want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| I am concerned, too, about CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| and the extra two plus million for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| I mean, that seems to be, that's a big increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| And I guess we want to hear why that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| and what the other alternatives are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Are there any discussions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| That's the other single, seems to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| or at first glance, anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| that seems to be the other big number that jumps out at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| But anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Well, as you said, you know, this can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| as the various budgets or pieces of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| come up during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| I'd be glad to have further discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| But we did, you know, one of the key things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| if you're going to borrow the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| first of all, we have a lot more borrowing capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| than we're recommending we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| We don't want to max out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Trying to be careful on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| But when you've got a board like Lakeshore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| that's willing to, you know, to raise the private dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| to further enhance the city asset that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| it's really a regional asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| I'm not sure what it'll be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| And you've got the zoo that has economic generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| as well as the private dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| that can be leveraged to maximize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| You know, it really fits in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| with the investment we've had for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Let's use strategic city investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| to maximize private sector investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Get a lot more bang for our buck in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| So those two made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| And all of these were projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| that we already have a substantial commitment to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| We're not really bringing you anything that's brand new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| no one's been thought of, nothing's been thought of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| because we have too many existing projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| that we're in for to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| And we feel like we need to propose that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| and work on those first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Like the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| You know, as I mentioned, we put $750,000 a year in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| We're going to build these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| We're going to help them build those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| But we're doing, as I said, we're front-loading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| We're trying to get it done quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| for a quicker return on investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| and to ultimately save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| So it made sense with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| With Lakeshore, we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| once all that land is transferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| we're going to have some buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| that are particularly bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| When you've got that many people at the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| and you've got so many needs for soccer fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| and different types of sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| then we felt it was important to get in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| and do the demo work as much as we can early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| both for safety reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| and then to provide a really needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| right now today, a needed resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| The Public Works Complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| which is really the biggest part, $15 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| that's something that was started under Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| He recognized the need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| started acquiring the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Mayor Brown continued that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| And last year, you all agreed to my proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| to go ahead and start with the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| designing the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| That's something that, again, is forward-thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| Yeah, could we go with the crummy building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| we've had for the last, how many years, 50 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| Perhaps, but is that the most efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Is that good for our workforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Is it good for our inventory and equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| You know, it's just not an efficient building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| So these all were projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| and of course, Prosser Road is the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| and everybody knows the problem with the flooding there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| and how it impacts not only the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Chilhowee Park, but just commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| the businesses and the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| trying to get back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| So we thought that if we're gonna do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| if we're gonna borrow money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| then it's gotta be for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| that we know we've got a commitment to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| something we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| It's not pie-in-the-sky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| something we would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| It's something that we're already invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| in one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| and will have a big impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| And that's kind of what drove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| our decision-making on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Okay, I look forward to hearing more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| I mean, what are the pie-in-the-sky things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| that you left out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| I mean, I'm not opposed to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| I mean, is there something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| that you say, wow, we should do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| You wanna borrow more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| I'd put $10 million in sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| you know, something like that if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| and additional sidewalks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| But we felt like that we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| had to, you know, be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| in how much we did borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| We still wanted to be cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| But there are, yeah, pie-in-the-sky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| it's not pie-in-the-sky, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I can make a good case for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| But we decided, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| as I just said, to have ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| that we were on the hook for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| I'd already made an initial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| original investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| We were on the path to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Jim York's looking nervous down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Well, he'd wanna put $20 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| in sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Sure he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| I was just curious, and unless I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| miss this, you know, I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| that we have a five-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| and I was curious, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| the five-year plan in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| not only expenses, but also revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I'm interested in what's not only happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| today, but, you know, I'd like to see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| chart that says we're gonna be spending this much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| next year, next year, next year, and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| how that ties into what our revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Do you want me to do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| So we have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| at some time. I mean, I'm real curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| I like to know what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| this year and next year and the following year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| and I'd like to know how the income is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Let me take that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| First of all, when you look at the five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| capital plan, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| are projects that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| identified by our various departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Each year we still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| to go back and analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| those. Another priority may have come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| or we may not have the revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| for it. And so, each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| year we have to see what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| Jim has to do his predictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| based on, you know, the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| based on the money that we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| this year, and we have to predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| what the revenues will be. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| hard to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| You know, it's hard to say exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| what our revenues are gonna be five years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| But the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| correct me if I'm wrong, Jim, but it's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| see as being needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| or desired in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| community, but each year we still have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| analyze every one of those and they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| and we may not be able to fund all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| I'm not talking about just the capital plan, I'm talking about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| overall budget. What would a five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| overall budget look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| And I realize we have to predict some, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| you know, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| expenses. We know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| expenses are gonna rise if we have a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| of revenue. So what's the, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| are we dealing with this in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| a five-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Now we switch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| from vision to numbers, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| this is kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| I guess you're kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| pre-stealing my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| presentation, but I'm gonna start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| The drivers of this budget, and these are gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| be the drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| what I see over the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| The first thing is on revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| And what we have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| in recent years, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| well, I think it's gonna go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| I don't expect a lot of significant growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| at least over the next five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| is property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Property tax to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| me is fairly flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| We have forecasts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| like 1.36 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| increase overall in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| Actually, if you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| personal and public utility, we're forecasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| basically a 1 percent growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| in overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| assessments. And again, this is before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| So what we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| is a fairly flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| or relatively low growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| in our major revenue source, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| is property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| tax, again, we're starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| to see a few signs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| recovery, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| sometimes we see good things, and then other times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| we see some things that kind of make us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| pause. For next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| year, we're forecasting kind of a 2 and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| percent growth rate in sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| think we're gonna end this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| And again, you take those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| sources of revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| You've got KUV. Now, we do expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| some growth in KUV payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| in lieu of taxes, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| you add all those things together, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| we're seeing fairly small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| relatively moderate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| growth. On the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| expense side, and again, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| drivers on the expense side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| are obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Our total compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| package next year, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| pension, we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| $106 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| plus in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| total compensation. Salaries are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| about a little over 69| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| million of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Again, as we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| forward, we're gonna continue to see growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| in that. This year, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| got hit with fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| significant health care cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| and please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| don't ask me to forecast where health care is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| gonna be in five years, because I'm not quite sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| where we're gonna be in a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| this year we were looking at not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| quite a million dollar increase in health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| care cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| The big factor, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| guess the elephant in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| is pension cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| What we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| in pension is significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| beginning next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| and the year after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| probably leveling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| in about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| This year, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| looking at a little over 16 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| dollars in pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Next year, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| still working that final number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| we're probably looking at close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| 24 million, and it's gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| be somewhere between 20 and 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| million. Two years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| I would suspect that that's gonna be around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| 26 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| If you were to ask me five years, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| say that's gonna be closer to 30 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| So again, that is the significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| driver going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| as we go forward, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| We have addressed at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| with the plan that was passed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| We've seen contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| people coming on. We're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| at like an 8 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| contribution rate for general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| government and about a 10 percent contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| rate for new police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| For existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| police and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| it's a little over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| It could well have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| gone up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| 25 percent of salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| We're looking at close to 15 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| this year, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| going forward, we're gonna be looking up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| into the mid-20s. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| you're asking what I think it's gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| five years. Now again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| this year, we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| good success in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| I wish I could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| that that's what I think that's gonna have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| some positive impact, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| what we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| is how much, because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| use a variety of methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| to kind of smooth, I wish I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| say this is smooth growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| but rather than spike up and down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| we use a smoothing technique, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| won't even capture, we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| captured all the losses that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| experienced five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| and neither will we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| capture all the gains that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| expect to have this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| because of those techniques that we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| And again, if you just look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| that, we were able to do some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| this year in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| pension to hold that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| And I know I've met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| with Council Member Stair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| and I think we've discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| We were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| potentially a $22.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| million contribution to pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| We were able to, again, as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| of the actions that you took a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| we were dropping that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| into the $16 million range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| I look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| and I see some significant issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| I think you look at those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| and you're going to see some significant issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| We have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| the mayor has made a commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| and I'm not sure that I'm too crazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| about this idea, but as soon as this budget's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| passed, we're going to start working on the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| We are constantly looking at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| to try and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| the pension issues as well as other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| areas of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| And again, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| health care, I just don't have a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| clue on health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| I know this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| we were able to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| the reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| in hall income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| I, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| going forward, I still think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| some significant, there's some significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| risk that we could lose the hall income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| you know, I hate to put a downer on some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| but, you know, that's, you asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| the question, and you wanted to know where I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| going to be five years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| I think those are the issues, and I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| delve into depth if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| like me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1414)|
| 0:23:42| Where we are headed and what is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| And with your judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| both past experience and present and future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| So good luck on your job for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| And as he said, we talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| all the time. Where are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| next year and the year after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| So we'll give him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| about a week off after you all pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| budget, and then we'll start working on next year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| Well, for the sake of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| let's go ahead and move with this. These are things we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| going to cover during the day, but Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Yeah, I just wanted to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| the mayor to make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| about the homeless plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| I know you've done some moving around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| the figures and captured it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| in community development. Just kind of give us a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| of where this came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Is there, in fact, a $125,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| increase, or is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| moving? Right, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| we have continued our commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| to case management for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| situation, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| we've continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| last year we added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| $125,000 for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| KCDC, for case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| of the KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| housing complexes. That was put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| the CAC line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| It actually should, this year we're moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| it to the Office of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Homelessness to Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| So it is, we are continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| to provide case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| It's been a very effective program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| to work with folks that are in some of the high rises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| that KCDC owns, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| we're continuing the case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| for Flinican and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Menvella. So none of that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| changed, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| remember we have homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| services through our community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Thanks for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Nick, is there an old man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| you got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| I think the mayor needs to get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| I'll ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| if you have any more questions for me, I'll see you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| at lunch. I do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| a dental appointment this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| unless y'all want me to cancel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| This might be more fun, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| I don't know to put a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| perspective on my dental appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| y'all know where to find me, and I'm glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| answer any questions personally, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I'm leaving you in excellent hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| with our staff here. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Jim, you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| or who's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| do the overview? We've kind of done an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| We've done kind of a real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| dirty five-year overview. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| let's talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| about a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I know that debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| We are proposing again a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| $31.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| debt issue. Just to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| some idea, we estimate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| annual debt service on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| amortized over 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| years to be around $2.1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| There are, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| I'm going to kind of get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| as much as finance people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| can get philosophical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| There are kind of two approaches to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| funding things, and one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| is called a pay-as-you-go approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| and one is called a pay-as-you-use approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| There are neither| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| approaches, either right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| or wrong. In fact, probably in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| personal lives, we all do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| use both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Under a pay-as-you-go approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| and I'm going to address, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| kind of the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| the public service complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| At the zoo, we have an annual contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| and again, for this year, it was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| to be on the order of $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| for capital. They have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| separate contract for operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| But we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| the city has put a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| of money in past years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| into this public service complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| and one approach is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| that you continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| do that. Just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| put in maybe $500,000 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| a million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| and that's what we call a pay-as-you-go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| approach, and we could do the same thing with the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| We could put $750,000 in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| maybe jump it to, I think, a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| next year per the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| What that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| does is, again, that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| take on any new debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| but at the same time, you are deferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| that maintenance, and you're just continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| to put that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| and fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| those projects over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| and, again, that's what we've been doing, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| the public service complex and the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| for, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| the zoo, we've been doing it probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| for the last 20 years, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| the public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| we've probably been doing that for about the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| five or six years, putting in a little bit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| and there, mostly for property acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| But if we were to try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| bite off a $15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| project for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| service complex, we're probably looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| at least another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| I'd say another five to eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| and possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| as much as ten years, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| we would be deferring that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Same thing in terms of the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| You can either, you know, front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| the money, and the way you front the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| quite honestly is to go out and borrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| and that's what we call the pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| as you use approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| what happens is that the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| who are paying for those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| will pay for them as they use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| If you were to continue to defer, you'd have people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| putting in taxes for the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| five to ten years and not receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| any of those benefits, and again, they could move out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| they could die, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| the difference. Now again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| money is cheap. We think we're going to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| borrow somewhere on the 2% range, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| again, we can borrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| right now, we can borrow tax-free. I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| tell you what's going to happen with Congress. That could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| change, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| just bear in mind that I've assumed all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| at a tax-free rate and not a taxable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| rate, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| 2% is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| call cheap money, so you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| borrow much cheaper than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| you know, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| And so that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| kind of the philosophical basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| for why you do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Again, you could argue, well, you know, should we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| fund projects? But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| these are projects that we're probably going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| done anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Again, we could continue to do those on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| two-go basis rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| issue debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Now, the Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Project and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Prosser Road, we have provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| again funding in the past for Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| We put money in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| this past budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| for Prosser Road, you know, to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| some preliminary design estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| and so forth, and now we're just hitting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| construction. Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| again, we have a lot of long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| commitments once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| take ownership of the property, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| guess when we're going to take ownership on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| property and let other people do that, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| that seems to be a fairly moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| target. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| because we have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| commitments, we tried to, again, thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| that those were good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| up-front investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| because we could have, you know, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| tear down, you know, some buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| you know, maybe one every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| year for the next five to ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| but again, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| money is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| relatively cheap, then this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| good investment for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| And again, if we kind of look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| a present value of where we think things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| could happen, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| I don't know where interest rates are going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| but I don't think they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| go down much. There's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| upside risk than there is downside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| risk, and so, again, if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| at it, this is kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| and wise investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| And again, you're hanging for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| somebody that doesn't like to issue debt, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| but I think it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| very, very reasonable approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| and it makes good financial sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| And the city has done a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| job of paying down its debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| The last what we call new money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| issue was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| 2004, early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| We did take on debt for the Amoresco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| but we are not in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| In fact, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| not in the market borrowing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| We've probably been in the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| in the last ten years maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| three times, and one of those was for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| refunding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| So this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| a case where we're constantly borrowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| so this is a kind of good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| The 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| well, the total issue was probably like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| 80 some odd million dollars, but most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| of that was a refunding. The new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| money piece of that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| around 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| some odd million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Probably about the same size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| as this, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| You want to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| What do we get for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| 30 million then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Well, you have a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| at Main Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Garages, which was one of the things that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| funded out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| There were a lot of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| smaller projects, you know, some road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| projects and some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| We've actually used a portion of those funds to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| do some of the work on South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| But the big ticket item, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| as you will, was the Main Avenue Garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| We want to let Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| talk numbers all the time you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| He's starting to get happy with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| You can see, finish and then take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I'd probably rather just take questions as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Jim, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| where the philosophical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| question meets the reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| question you were talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| We're looking at flat income streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| and our big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| revenue side, the property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| and the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| We found some debt. We think the debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| is going to add about $2.1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| a year if we borrow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| 314.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| But you already said earlier that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| the pension costs are going to ramp up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| from $14 to $16 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| where we are now to $26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| or $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Meeting that shortfall becomes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| problem and it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| future borrowing is coming our way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| or some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| So how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| combine those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| issues to see that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| staying on safe ground and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| being overextended because it sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| looks like we're going to be borrowing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| if there's no new revenue streams to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| the growing bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| I'm not sure how to frame that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| but that's the concern area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Well, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| part of this is we look long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| We know that we have some significant issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| and, again, the primary driver being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| We hope that there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| more of a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Again, I don't think it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| And I still think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| there is limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| land area inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| That has its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| limitation in terms of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| we've really seen that in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| residential. Most of our growth is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| in commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| In fact, a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| property tax growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| in assessed value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| actually residential was down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| So we've seen it in commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| commercial is reflected in apartments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| other commercial activities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| But that's where the real growth is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| and we continue to expect that there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| some growth in commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| But we're looking, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| at everything that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| in terms of various revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| options and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| we're looking at expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| We're looking at all those things as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| try and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| how we're going to deal with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| rising pension costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| You know, we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| some other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Again, I can't tell you whether we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| borrow, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| money next year or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| We're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| again try and be fiscally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| the mayor, you know, wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| obviously try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| and hold our bond ratings where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| and they're at the highest rate they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| what you see there, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| we've just got some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| challenges ahead and I think we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| face those as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Again, I've got other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| here that can say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| but we're going to try and remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| fiscally responsible as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| address all this. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| whether that involves borrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| in the future, we will have some things rolling off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| So that's the good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Old debt that's rolling off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Old debt continues to roll off because we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| rolling off debt again for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| We haven't seen a net gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| This is the first net gain probably in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| There's nothing to be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| in further debt reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| by borrowing cheap money, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Well, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| refunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| We talked a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| We did a refund, a sizable refunding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| a year ago and we're saving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| $1.4 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Now, when we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| where it gets confusing is a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| portion of that debt savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| was for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| And we kind of treat that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| kind of separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| So we did see some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| that was probably a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| than half was on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| But we do have some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| that are going to roll off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| We'll continue to look at various options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| there that we can to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| But if we think we can obviously refund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| anything and save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| at this point, we've pretty much refunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| everything that we legally can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| There's only certain dates you can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| call the bonds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Well, yeah, there are only certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| dates we can call the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| again, finance people love this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| and you guys probably don't care about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| and that shows you've got some good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| We have done what you call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| advanced refundings in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| so we can't do those again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| You talked about the sinking fund one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| when you did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Well, no, it's basically where you finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| before you can call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| But that's kind of a tricky financial thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| and you can only do that once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| and still comply with the IRS rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| So my advice is don't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| we'll continue to look at that and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| again, as we get some things that we can call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| we'll look at those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| near the call dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| But some of that, we're just going to roll off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| because we're going to continue to pay down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| existing debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| Further questions or comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| budget overview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| If not, I guess we can move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Tank is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| I'll address Tank if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Tank's budget or community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| relations. Basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| On the handout, it's page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| It's the org number that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| as 11116.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| And then in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| budget manual that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Fannette's prepared for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| it is page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| And it's included in the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| But if you want to look at his individually, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Let me just kind of give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| you know, what's covered under mayor's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| You know, they mean something to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| Obviously, you've got the mayor's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| which covers the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| some people, some administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| folks in her office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Then you have community relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| You have policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| and redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| and Dr. Lines is going to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| any questions you might have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| Angela| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Stark's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I'll steal her thunder. The big change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| is one-time funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| for redevelopment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| website, but I'll let her tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| the specifics on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| You have special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Judith's here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| No major changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| You have 311, and we're going to cover 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| later this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Then you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| business liaison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| and she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| not here yet either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| There are no significant changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| there. It's a pretty small budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| the last one out of the mayor's office is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I don't see them here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| But in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| community relations, and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| that's 11116| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| to the finance folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| there are no significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| The overall budget is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| $401,610.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| It's up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| about $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| That's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| salary creep. That's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| salaries and benefits, and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| you're going to hear that reiterated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| because we do have health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| increases, we have salary increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| pension increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| So, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| outside of a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| is going to be the consistent theme that you're going to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| all day today. There are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| a lot of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| things other than maybe some one-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| adjustments, and we have shifted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| some things among funds, and we'll try and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| that. That's the issue that you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Councilmember Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| asked about earlier, where we shifted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| some things out of CAC into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| and things within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| But, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| actually, if you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| the salaries out, the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| expense items that are budgeted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| community relations are down slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| So, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| can get into the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| I'm happy to get into weeds, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| I don't think anybody that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| pretty much a maintenance budget from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| with the salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| It just doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| any new items in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Councilman? Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Mr. Vice Mayor. Yeah, Jim, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| address it now, because you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| right. It seems like we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| really religious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| trying to hold the line and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| grow the budget needlessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| in terms of these kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| and there is salary creep and health care costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| and all those things you told us about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Is there any consideration being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| made at all to a proposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| where we look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| maybe for a year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| some differentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| in cost of living increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| or whatever, where low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| people, say, under $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| get the two-and-a-half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| and others are evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| in terms of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| the budget will bear kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| In other words, do we have any plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| to try to shave some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| cost creeps? You raise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| salary, it spills over into the benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| they bump up a stair step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| I mean, that's an ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| problem forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Are we going to look at that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| some way we can treat it differently to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| both fair to the employees but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| pressure the budget year after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| year, because you said, what, 106| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| or 109 million of the 180| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| was salary related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| So that's going to be the driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| looking forward forever, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| in terms of a service organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Well, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| and let me talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| This year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Vicki Hatfield will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| here later to talk about some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| So, again, I'm still letting some other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| thunder. This is big picture stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| But if we look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| that have affected this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| as part of our salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| survey, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| increased the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| entry level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| salaries for those people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| in what I call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| I'm going to call it pay grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| one, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| she may use slightly different terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| But we have increased the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| based on the salary survey, and that's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| of the things we look significantly at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| we have increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| or actually allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| $225,000 in the civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| service budget for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| And so we're going to be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| at those things. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| again, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| kind of one of those things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| start out with every year. We discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| those things as how do we want to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| compensation. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| if, for example, we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| that, you know, some classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| may or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| are undervalued relative to the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| or conversely overvalued relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| to the market, then we may well address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| this compensation study and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| everything going forward. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| again, we have allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| $225,000 to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| look at the overall compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| levels. That's like the Mercer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| plan type study that looks at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| what the marketplace is doing for a comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| job, right? That's what you're talking about. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| We're calling it a classification study. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| know whether I can use Mercer without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| violating trademark or copyright, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| It's America. You can do it. Go ahead. But it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| a mild study. You're going to defend me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Yes, sir. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Jim is innocent. Okay. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| that addresses how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| we're looking compared to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| private marketplace in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| and are we paying the right kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| of scale to get the right kind of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| That's what the survey does, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| And entry levels, you said, have already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| adjusted this year because they were probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| on the low side. My question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| goes to if we treat everyone the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| the guy that makes $31,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| in or the guy that makes $120,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| on the top end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| in terms of salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| And everyone loves a salary increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| and a benefit increase, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| there may be a difference in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| both need in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| of facing cost of living versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| a nice perk, but maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| not absolutely necessary. In a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| world where budgets are tight, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| we looking at maybe differentials of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| we treat people? And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| as we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| again, we start off with lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| questions as we prepare this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| again, because salaries are such a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| big part of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| I mean, we're not going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| talking about, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| you know, I'll do everything I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| to squeeze out building rent, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| it's not going to be the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| driver. So the first thing you always start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| as you start to put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| the budget is your salaries, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| it's the largest base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| And again, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| that those are always some of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| we will look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| All right, let me go to Councilman Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Yeah, thanks. I think just the quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| comment I had there is I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| this year, two and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| meets the market. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| that's what we have to look at each year is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| to decide that, yeah, it's an automatic, but we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| have the right to pull that. I mean, we can vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| against that or raise it. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| this year in the marketplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| I would say two and a half percent across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| the board is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| market. And I think it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| it might even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| basically that's what we did or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| a little bit more and then in my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| private study. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| we're good with that. I don't disagree with you. I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| flexibility going forward. I think we always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| have that flexibility to vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| And I think this year it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| I think you're right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Again, I will say that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| we have done that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| maybe not to the extent that some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| would like. It has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| it was done under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Mayor Haslam. We have addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| differential raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| We have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| flat dollar raises above a certain limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| having done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| that, you know, I know that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| continue to look at those things in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| Patricia's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| I'd like to get an overview from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| of your office since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| it's new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| if we could. Just kind of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| highlights from past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| Oh, my bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| You're up at 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| You're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| mentioned as under the Mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| So we'll hold that to 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| I didn't see you on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| So that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| I would suggest that maybe we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Angela Stark. She's all excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| to talk about her website redesign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| And Angela, I just wanted to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| I had highlighted in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| because out of all the Mayor's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| and the different orgs in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| you had probably the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| increase from last year's budget to this year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| budget and it's in professional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| an increase of 71,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| if you want to touch on that for Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Sure. Good morning, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Jim, as he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| has stolen my thunder so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| really that 70,000 speaks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| the redesign of the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| The 71, I think 1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| is in there just for professional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| and then the 70 is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| a complete redesign of the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| We have looked at other cities this size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Lexington, Greensboro in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| even smaller cities I should say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| and have found that their websites are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| aesthetically pleasing. Ours is very functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| We do have a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| who say it's easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| to find information on there but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| as Janet Wright has told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| it is the calling card of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| and I think a redesign is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| It will help us to be and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| cater more to the public in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| We have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| requests and wish lists from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| so we're going to try to work that in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| but that's going to have to obviously go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| through first your approval and then the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| What are some of the bells and whistles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Well the bells and whistles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| that we've requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| have been or have heard requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| for include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| simple permits online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| a permit fee estimator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| people wanting to maybe apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| for business licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| paying for shelter, parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| rec, they have so many shelters and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| who want to reserve tennis courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| being able to do that and actually pay online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| A couple of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| pay online services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| high blue sky as they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| would be to actually have apps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Councilman Della Volpe I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| you'll appreciate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| have apps that you go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| and you will take a photo of something that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| maybe trashed somewhere in the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| or debris in the road or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| and you're able to text that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| into 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| or into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| maybe a Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| district so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| it will allow the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| to be more interactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| One of the questions that I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| is with some of the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| for example if I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| if I need a permit for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| license for my dog or cat or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| in the redesign are we going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| that a little more user| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| friendly and less complicated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Well that certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| is the goal yes we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| that everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| every function on that website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| the new redesign would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| that's practical and something that makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| I've recently been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| with a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| and one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| concerns was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| fact that the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| was not as easy to navigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| as they had hoped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| there's another maybe bigger issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| and I don't know if this comes to you or whom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| we need a master calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| that all organizations in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| city can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| rely on input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| because we've had two or three occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| recently where two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| major events have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| occurred at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| and that doesn't help anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| at all we obviously have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| make choices where we're going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| but it would be a real benefit if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| could step up to the plate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| and have a master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| calendar and it would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| input from Visit Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| require input from organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| like the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| special events offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| there's just a lot of things that go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| and if there was some place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| people could check to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| oh my gosh at 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| on November 3rd nothing scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| I'll do my event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| that would be good to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| rather than there are 14 things going on at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| well we certainly agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| we do know that special events publishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| a calendar but it is by no means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| comprehensive to what everything is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| so a master calendar I've written that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| as a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| and when we talk with people about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| redesign that would be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| no I don't think so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| Ms. Foltz is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| so if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| give an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| of what's going on with special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| I do apologize my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| 8 year old granddaughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| had her award ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| this morning so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| running a little late but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| I think the highlight is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| of course our Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3367)|

| 1:01:31| I mean 7 to 9 excuse me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| we have a concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| series that's free to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| and CBID was kind enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| fund some funding for that this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| and next year my goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| is to actually get some corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| sponsorship for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| so that's as close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| and we have a little bluegrass coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| either this week or next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| I think WDVX is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| partnering with us. I was going to say that's a great partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| because they've got the marketplace. They do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| they do they're partnering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| with us for I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| 3 or 4 concerts they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| we pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| the musicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| but WDVX gets the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| gets the bands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| for us. Lines them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Any other questions for Ms. Folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Next up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3741)|

| 1:02:25| Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| Community Development's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| starts on page 4 in the handout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| and then under the budget detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| tab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| it would be page 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| She also has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| some other funds too. She has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| the 260| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| and 290. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| Correct. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| And most of those funds we've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| about at the annual action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| council workshop and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| public hearing and that plan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| been submitted to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| You all have approved that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| most of the projects and activities that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| funded through Community Development are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| federally funded through HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| and so what you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| at now are the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| funded operating I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| under the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| admin that pays for the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| for the oversight of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| there is an increase in rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| and that is to offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| a decrease that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| we've sustained through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| sequestration and a decrease in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| CDBG funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| So that's general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| fund dollars to help pay for the rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| for our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Under grants and benevolences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| you'll see an increase of $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| and that's for the community schools program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| That's been added to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| this budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| The other grant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| is for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| and that's something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| have implemented annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| The Affordable Housing Trust Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| is operated through the East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Foundation and they fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| a number of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| with various implementers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| such as CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3855)|

| 1:04:21| League, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| they fund home ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| projects that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| not have to meet the federal requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| of the home funds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| we have. So it's a great partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| that we have with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| I'm looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| our version of the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| budget on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| three. Chronic problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| properties went from $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Is that a reflection of the reduction in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| federal funds or do we have holdover funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Are we doing less of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| No, we're not doing less of it, but we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| some funds that we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Carryover funds from this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| That we are still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| We do have properties in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| queue for all the funds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| are there for the chronic problem properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| as well as the blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| So we are continuing with our acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Well, again, I don't use the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| carryover. That's a CD term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| things that we have, we notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| we have consistently, the city has consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| chronic problem properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| And we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| built up some balances in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| and we'll be drawing those down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| again over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| We thought that we had sufficient funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| and that's why you'll see the reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| here is just so we can bring down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| some of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| funds. Plus you doubled it last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| year. You went from 250 to 500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Thank you. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3965)|

| 1:06:13| helping to fund, how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| schools are we dealing with now? I know we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3975)|

| 1:06:19| Sarahmore Green and that's a relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| new thing. How many are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| dealing with if you know? I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| can't, I do not know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| I know those funds are in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3987)|

| 1:06:31| meeting with the great schools and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| schools project to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| a contract. My understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=3995)|

| 1:09:23| to that concept to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4163)|

| 1:11:47| to fix up one? There was talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| a safety city that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4309)|

| 1:12:05| I know we've got the Willow Cottage but they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| talking about a facility that would have beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| that would treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| folks picked up by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4331)|

| 1:12:25| but at this point the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| has said they will not need any additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| space at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| I thought we were going to get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| of that land. Are we going to maybe try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| to convert and lease out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4355)|

| 1:12:45| that we are not going to take down but right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| most of those buildings are in very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4369)|

| 1:13:43| a good thing to have David and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4423)|

| 1:14:33| I'd like to ask Mr. Massey something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| I've been thinking about and wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| I'm going to kind of pull a Nick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Della Vopa here since he's in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| We'll bring him up here. I told him I was going to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| to him last night. I'm just interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| I think one of your strategies last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| was to bring on additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| staff in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| maybe encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| more leadership within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| neighborhood groups and, you know, talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| how that's gone for you all this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4497)|

| 1:15:01| Well, it used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| to be, as some of you know, that the Office of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Leadership consisted of one person, me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4505)|

| 1:15:09| Mary O'Hara, she is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| allowing Jackie Clay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| who is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| in her office, to spend three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| a week in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| Office of Neighborhoods. So two days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| in the Mayor's office and three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| a week in the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| Jackie is the staff person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| primarily responsible for the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| of a leadership training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| We've had that underway for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| We're building it from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| We're working with a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| of neighborhood leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| and professional community organizers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| who are helping us put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| It's called Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Strong Neighborhood Organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| It's a leadership training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| that emphasizes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| everyone leads and emphasizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| that the first job of a leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| is to develop new leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| And so once we roll it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| and we hope to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| by the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| this calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| I think you'll be pleased with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| the results of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| It's hands-on training. As some of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| become presidents of neighborhood organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| and really haven't ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| had anyone walk them through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| what the responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| are or what the duties are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| or how to recruit people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| to the organization. And this is true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| across all types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| of neighborhoods. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| is our primary approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| to addressing those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| but so is the Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Conference. And you'll see in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| still have $18,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4603)|

| 1:16:53| yourself and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| budget on that conference was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| around $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| We had $18,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| in the budget. We raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| $13,500. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| leaving $7,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| approximately in the account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| to be returned to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| The $18,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| gives us a base upon which we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| confidently go forward and plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| a large conference, but we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| clearly continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| work on sponsorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| The other thing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| a couple of years ago we suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| the Neighborhood Grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4649)|

| 1:17:33| the conference and concentrate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| the development of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| We are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| soon going to be restoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| and reviving the Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| Small Grants Program in a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| of different ways, and we'll have some announcements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| on that shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| Yeah, one thing before you leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| David. I was glad to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| you talk about recruitment as one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| of the focuses. One of my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| as I go around to some neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| meetings is that there's an awful lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| gray hair, and there's nothing wrong with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| but we're not getting out as many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| young people, and it's partly a function of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| couples both working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| and there isn't a lot of free time, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| kids to be fed, scrubbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| and put to bed. But it seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| sort of like churches, if everyone grays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| eventually that's going to fall away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| from us, so recruiting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| finding how to engage more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| people is an important thing. It is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| indeed. Yeah, and that's actually one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| the topics that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| Neighborhood Advisory Council is interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| pursuing. We have one member of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| that council who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| a recent graduate of UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| School of Social Work and has a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| interest in young people, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| that is something that we're taking a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| at across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| Congressman Brown. Yes. Did you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| I was at a neighborhood meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| yesterday morning, and they elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| new offices. Now the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| training for new leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| is that an ongoing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| you said, or do they need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| contact your office? They can certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| contact our office. We're not ready to roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| that program out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Once we do, we'll start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| with a class of 30 people, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| we're not going to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| you know, take care of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| It'll be an application process, much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| like CAC leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| It'll be basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| an 11-week program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| to two and a half hours a night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| once a week. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| at some point, we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| making announcements that applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| are open for that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Okay, thank you. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| Anything else, Ms. Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| from Community Development? Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| If not, we're going to move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Your office has been very busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| here lately, thank goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| I'd also like to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| as Mr. Wetzel and others are coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| that we do have Rhonda Rice here, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| with the Innovation Valley and the Chamber, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| not otherwise on the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| She'd be glad to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| too, because we work with them on economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| We'll have her down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Melissa, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Office of Policy Development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| within the Mayor's office on page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| It's like the third organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| down, and then he talks so much about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| the other projects that they have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| I thought I'd bring the A team up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| here to the table today, because they're the ones who get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| work done here. So if you have questions for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| they have some comments to make here in a minute. It might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| easier. Just as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| overview, I think as you alluded, we have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| going on right now. We have our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Cumberland Avenue projects. We have several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| projects going in the South Waterfront area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| The downtown area continues to move, and the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| north area continues to function as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| And we're kicking off the Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| Old City area. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| we have a lot of projects going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| We'd like to tell you, last week, the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| part of the week, Don, Michelle, Ann, and I went down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| the National Brownfields Conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| in Atlanta. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| you all should know that everybody in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| is doing a lot of what we're doing, but we're out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| in the forefront of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| continuing from brownfield to redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| is where you're on that spectrum, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| it's a University Commons development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| whether it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4881)|

| 1:21:25| or whether it's redoing the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| wholesaling warehouses down on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| We're doing the things that it takes to rebuild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| the city from the center out, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| we're kind of on the forefront of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| Everybody's doing it, but you listen to programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| the sessions we did, and we're right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| with what folks are doing nationally on that, and we're very proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| of that. So I want to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| You'll see in our budget for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| we don't talk a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| about our operating budget. You get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| out of the operating budget, and we might take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| a trip once a year. That's about all we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| on our operating budget. Ours is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| capital fund driven as we try to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| those projects and create those initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| that will lead to growth here in the core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| With that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| said, we might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| if you'd like to, we'll walk through these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| or if you all want to ask questions on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| just let me know how you want to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| on that. My staff is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| more than happy to talk about what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| If we want to, we can start that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| And Donna Michelle, you want to talk just a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| bit about Magnolia and South Waterfront?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| You can either come here or stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Well, as Bob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| said, with Mayor O'Hara's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| for disinvestment to investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| we are now looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| expanding that through the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| spine, through the corridor, and we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| the Old City and the Magnolia Avenue Warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| District and along the Magnolia Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| Corridor. So saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| what you're seeing in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| budget is a request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| $300,000 for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| streetscape improvements and sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| improvements in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| A lot of that was based on the Old City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| Merchants Association and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| the Old City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| streetscape improvements and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| enhance that pedestrian experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| underneath the James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| updating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| experience to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Old City. Either you park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| there under the James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| and you walk into the Old City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| but based on the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| of the plan, it needs to be a safer experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| than that. So what we did, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| put out a letter of interest for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| and we have hired a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| consultant to move forward with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| to look at constructing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| the sidewalks and enhancing that experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| from Jackson Avenue, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Patton Street into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| Gay Street, just east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| of where the Jackson Avenue ramps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| start. For the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Magnolia Avenue Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| the Magnolia Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Corridor Plan, which was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| OTC plan back in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| and asking a consultant to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| corridor plan, identify a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| model block that may be a potential opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| for reinvestment somewhere along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Magnolia Avenue Corridor, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| looking at streetscape improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| pedestrian connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| including crosswalks. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| to expand on that a little bit, we want to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| the First Creek Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| look at Caswell Park, and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| if a consultant can give us an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| idea on how to expand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| into Magnolia, maybe into the OTC, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| eventually tie it into Second Creek and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Thank you very much. Any questions on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Magnolia Warehouse piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| I think it's wonderful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| we're starting finally to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| the Magnolia, which I think is one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| most, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| the most potential of any of our corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| probably also deals with the Office of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Neighborhoods. The neighborhoods out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| are not as focused and as organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| as in some other parts of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| and we all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| But there is a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| maybe eventually be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| and that's Burlington, downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| Burlington. I'm afraid by the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| we get there, it's going to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| I mean, it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| shaky right now. I don't know if with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| perhaps some facade improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| funds, something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| can do to at least tweak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| that area. That area is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| fragile. It is very fragile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| Our Community Development Department has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| worked closely with several business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| out in that area. There have been a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| of facade grants, is that correct, Rogers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| Out there this year for the Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| area. It's certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| one of those neighborhood commercial hubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| different but similar to, say, the Bearden Hub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| where you have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| to have a walkable urban community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| within an automobile type of environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| and we certainly address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| We know the need is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| What all this takes is individual private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| investment. How do we drive private investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| becomes the goal of all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| All of that, in my mind, ties together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| and the neighborhoods are a great big part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| And that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| we have some softness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| Right. No, we're with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| It's on the radar, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Let's slow down before we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| And adding to that, both of these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| involve stakeholder and residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| as part of that public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| Good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| About a year and a half or two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| we had that conference with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| some of the downtown developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| that got together, Jeffrey Nash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| and the others, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| it was really helpful to hear their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| perspectives. Are we going to do that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| As these guys start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| working on that Magnolia warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| core, the question is, how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| reach out to the old mill? How do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| reach down Magnolia corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| towards the Pellissippi State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| and everything else? That was such a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| helpful refocus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| of energy and finding out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| what really kind of makes their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| programs tick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| We learned pretty quickly that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| don't want to do something in an isolated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| block. They want to be sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| bounded by the development that grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| But hearing their perspective was certainly helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| It certainly was. In fact, we picked up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| that program as part of the East Knoxville Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| and Professional Group, and we had them down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| at the History Center for a conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| They did a great job of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| So, yes, there's a lot to be learned from our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| guys who are out there doing it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Right, and have kind of the hard Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| experience of that. You'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| They'll be the guys who move us east to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| east and north. That's a different thing. They've already moved to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| north end of the valley. Somebody will be moving on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| Knox High this summer, I think, as we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| through that process. The standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| netting mill has already kind of been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| down by an individual group here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| So I think you're going to see some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| continue to roll out in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| A second question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| sort of separate and apart from the Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Corridor, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| some of us were at a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| last night over at East Town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| and the new Harvest Park, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| there was probably 80 to 100 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| The concern was what can the city do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| to help those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| what? Sort of maximize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| the business potential. That mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| was going to be sold a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Simon's come back and said they're interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| in revitalizing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| They've got an energized leasing agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| and we're talking about things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| visibility and signs and whatnot, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| is there any focused money in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| budget to see what the city can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| do to be a good partner so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| encourage economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| investment and growth there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| There's no particular money in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Remember the focus of our department is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| work from downtown out and to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| the core neighborhoods. Certainly the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| experience at East Town Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| are relevant in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| sense of the historic continuum of what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| going on downtown, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| have no funds to work there at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| We have been in touch with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| new gentleman in town. I forget his name right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| now. Dustin Sterling. And I've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| him in touch with three or four different city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| departments so he'll understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| who does what and what's going on here at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| He's bringing some energy to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| Yeah, he's bringing great energy and we're trying to help him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| coordinate and facilitate with some of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| That's the role we're playing at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| All right. Donald gives us just a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| quick update on South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| About the Magnolia. So how much is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| in the budget for the Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| corridor plan? What do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| There was $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| last year and there's $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| this year so now we're up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| half a million dollars in the Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| corridor if this year's budget is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| And with that we hope to get design services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| for the two projects you just discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| get some implementation of the Old City project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| So the consultant that you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| has someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| already been hired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| You will see him in front of council here in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| month. There has been the interview process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| and the selection process, but we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| have them under contract, but they should come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| very soon. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| So like I was saying, South Waterfront, Don,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| if you could give just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| two minute update on South Waterfront, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| a challenging thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| South Waterfront, I can update you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| on two of the projects that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| receive a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| request from last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| which was to move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| funds already in the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| pot for construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| of Sutry Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| And right now that park is in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| that looks at the full build out of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| There's a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| facility that's going to be managed by Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| called Lincoln Landing and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| part of the streetscape that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| part of the roadway network that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| associated with the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| We're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| The consultant is moving forward in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| constructability review. We're hoping to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| all that input back with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| value engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| some direction on that before we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| into the final design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| So that's coming down the pike, but we're hoping to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| have construction on the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| begin by the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Secondly, the second item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| from last year was the Fort Dickerson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| realignment project, and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| engineering may talk to you a little bit more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| later on in the day, but that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| realignment of the Fort Dickerson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| park entrance to line up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| with Wound Line Pike, which includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| street improvements and pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| connectivity and intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5489)|

| 1:31:33| And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| also probably about 80%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| complete right now. Both of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5497)|

| 1:31:41| and Fort Dickerson will probably be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| back to the public once the constructability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| review is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5505)|

| 1:31:49| the design plans are final with Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Dickerson. So we'll be going back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| to the public with both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Let me add, too, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| Mr. Wetzel, that there's been a working group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| We've been meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| for, I guess, over a year now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| for the programming of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| we vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5525)|

| 1:32:09| once all this work starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| important that we have a vision there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| and we're about ready to bring it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| administration for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5537)|

| 1:32:29| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| pedestrian bridge? Is it dead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5553)|

| 1:32:39| It's alive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| in the sense that we have the roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| $600,000 design contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| We are currently in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| the geotechnical phase, is that correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| where we're trying to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| whether or not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| supports planned on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| north and the south bank of the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| will work? Is the soil good enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| so the geotech work needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| there? If, in fact, that proves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| to be that it can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| we'll continue to work on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| environmental phase at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| and then we're going to have to come to a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| time probably within the next year or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| as to whether we're going to commit more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| to this project or whether we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| We're going to have a lot more information on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| by the time we get there. We'll know if it's a doable project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| both environmentally and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| geotechnical-wise by the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| What's the proposed budget for that bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| The estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| budget from the first work that was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| if you take it from bank to bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| it was $11 million to $12 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| and then $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| to take it down on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| depending upon how you did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| so it could bump up to $20 quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Do you have a talk with partnering with UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=5625)|
