| 0:00:00| Thank you, Commissioners, for being in place. I didn't have to call on you to be in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=0)|
| 0:00:11| seat at 5 o'clock. I guess everyone's come this evening to see how the new show will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=11)|
| 0:00:18| run. First thing on the agenda, I would like to ask Commissioner Anders, would you lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=18)|
| 0:00:25| us in the Pledge of Allegiance? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=25)|
| 0:00:36| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=36)|
| 0:00:43| and justice for all. One of the first things I'd like to do this afternoon is at 4.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=43)|
| 0:01:02| the youth leadership of Knoxville had a meeting in the small room. Mayor Burchett spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=62)|
| 0:01:11| them and I would like to recognize them now. I think someone is going to come and give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| us a short presentation of youth leadership of Knoxville. Name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=77)|
| 0:01:31| please. Daryl Brady with Leadership Knoxville. Commissioner Wright, fellow Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=91)|
| 0:01:38| this is our youth leadership class. This is the second year that Leadership Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| has offered this class. We have 40 high school juniors from across 18 high schools in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| County and they have participated in a week-long summer camp during the summer from 9 to 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| with such topics as economic development, arts and culture, health care, public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| They've had the opportunity to learn about everything from the evils of texting and driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| to participating in their, being more engaged in their community. In addition to that, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=127)|
| 0:02:15| Wright and fellow Commissioners, they have participated one night a month from now until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| May and they've had the opportunity to visit a city council meeting tonight, a county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| meeting and then later a school board meeting. And in addition, we'll take the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| to visit some local industries and learn more about some of the job opportunities in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| community. And on behalf of our youth leadership class, thank you so much for your public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| Thank you for what you do and you are an inspiration and encouragement to all of our students and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| we appreciate you allowing us to come observe your meeting tonight. Thank you, sir. Would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| any Commissioner have a comment? You'll notice that there are the 40 plus are young students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| are over on my left. I think we need to give them a hand. Thank you for attending our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| Mayor Burchett, could I call on you for just a second? One of the late in the agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=188)|
| 0:03:23| for today is the Metropolitan Airport Authority. Mayor Burchett, could this presentation be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| made now so we can get it out of the way? Yes, sir. I want to thank the kids from Leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| Knoxville, the young folks. One of them totally just knocked me down a few notches by telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=215)|
| 0:03:43| me that I spoke to her fourth grade class. That's what they do to you when you tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| your term is limited. They just wear you out. But thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| commission, Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court, 37919. Today, we have a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=234)|
| 0:04:02| I feel of bringing an air show to this community the likes we haven't seen since prior to 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=242)|
| 0:04:12| As you well know, they stopped doing that across the country. But through the good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| of our HR Director, Colonel Richard Julian, we think we've landed a pretty big deal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| At this time, if we could have Travis Gardner from the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| come up. He's the Vice President of Operations. And maybe just talk a little bit about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| presentation. If that would be all right. Good evening. Although my appearance may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=275)|
| 0:04:44| youthful, don't make a mistake. I'm not a high school junior. And with the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| Airport Authority, I'm serving you as the air show director for the 2016 Smoky Mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| Air Show. It's the data set for April the 16th and 17th of 2016. It's going to be next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| spring, just a few short months away. If you have memory of an air show, it's a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| long memory, because it's been almost 16 years since this community has been able to host| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| an air show. I'm very proud to report to you that this air show is brought to you by partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| between several agencies, including the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority, the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| Air National Guard, Knox County Government, Blount County Government, as well as the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| of Knoxville Government. So I'm proud to report we had some great cooperation in both anchoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| the signature military act, which is the Blue Angels. They're going to come perform for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| us. And that, of course, is the headline. They'll be accompanied by about seven other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| acts that will soon, if you're excited to find out who they are, that's a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| because we're going to announce them incrementally this fall so that folks keep the air show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| on their mind. I'm also really happy to report something to you, and that is the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| attending the air show. I'm glad to mention it's going to be free. And if you didn't catch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| it the first time I said it, it's going to be free. And let me remind you, it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| to be free. We will be charging for parking, and there will be various concessions, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| well as we're selling some sponsorship to some of the community support businesses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| we have in the local area. One of the most common questions that we get is where are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| we going to put all these people, and how many people will there be? Based on some projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| that we've got with the folks with Visit Knoxville and the TVA and IFARE and the Boomsday Organizers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| we anticipate hosting about 160,000 to 180,000 people, and we're making contingency plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| that if it's as popular as we think it could be and perhaps may be, we've got some contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| plans to host a quarter million people, 250,000 over that three-day period. If you haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| attended an air show at McGee-Tyson Airport before, you'll want to plan on arriving. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| action starts about 10 a.m. in the morning, and the airport's going to close for about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| five times during that business day, and we'll have aerial performers of great variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| and description, followed up by the Blue Angels that will take the stage about four in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| afternoon, and they'll perform and do their presentation for about an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| So it'll be a full day of action and lots of other things to entertain a family, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=446)|
| 0:07:34| we're happy to present this. I can entertain any questions if you have some specifics you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| I just happen to have one. Travis, before the show is here, like a month early or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=460)|
| 0:07:51| like that, will they have maybe one of the jets that will come in to do just a demonstration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| or do some press or things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Yes. There will be one minor event and one major event. The Blue Angels advance team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| will be here probably the last week in January or the first week in February. That is yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| to be confirmed, and it will be a press-oriented event educating the public on what they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| expect to see at an air show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Likewise, on Friday, there will be an opportunity where it's a practice show day, and they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| do an abbreviated portion of their aerial demonstration, and we'll host folks by invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| A good example is school groups, special needs groups, folks that have limited mobility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| limited access. They'll be able to come out and see that air show without all the trappings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| of a large crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| And the next, as far as the press goes and letting the community know about the air show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| the next big event that you're going to see will be Cyber Monday, which is the Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| following Thanksgiving when online ticket sales will kick off. So if there's someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| special or perhaps not so special in your life and you struggle every year with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| to get them for Christmas, you can take care of their Christmas gift by purchasing online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| tickets for the air show through our website, which is SmokeyMountainAirShow.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| This ticket you're talking about, that will be for the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| In other words, what you buy online is a parking ticket then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Yes, sir. You will buy access to a parking lot located in the vicinity of the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| Any other questions? If not, thank you, Mr. Gardner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| We now have before us the agenda, and I'm going to word this somewhat strangely in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| everything is on consent except item six, which is BZA appointments, item seven, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=587)|
| 0:10:02| is Development Corporation appointment, item 45, contract for health insurance, item 46,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=602)|
| 0:10:14| which is a contract for pharmacy insurance, item number 27 is withdrawn, and I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=614)|
| 0:10:26| to add an agenda item, 26 is withdrawn, and then I would like to add an item, a co-sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=626)|
| 0:10:46| of Mayor Burchett and the Chair of Commission to sponsor the 2016 Smokey Mountain Air Show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=646)|
| 0:10:57| an amount of $25,000. Are there other items to be withdrawn, deferred, added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=657)|
| 0:11:07| Yes, Commissioner Thomas beat me to the 26, but I do want to add a discussion item about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=667)|
| 0:11:20| the Boomsday, but we're not going to discuss it this week. I'd like to delay it until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| You wish to delay it until next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| Next week, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Discussion item on Boomsday for next week. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=692)|
| 0:11:42| Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I would like to add a discussion item about setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| a time for the meeting of the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| To discuss tonight or at the full meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| We can do it tonight if we could, and see if we could set a date in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=717)|
| 0:12:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to put a discussion item on the agenda for this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| about Commissioners Bussler, Commissioners Brantley, and myself attending the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| County Services Association Fall Conference in Murfreesboro next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| For this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Just because the registrations have to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to pull item number 39 off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| We will discuss item 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| Mr. VanVate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If everything's on consent, I think this is probably implicit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| but we did just want to enter into the record that item 33, Resolution 405, would need to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=779)|
| 0:13:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| 33 to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| I'd like to request, please, that item 45 be deferred to next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| That contract is almost ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| We're trying to add a wellness component, and that needs to be included in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=807)|
| 0:13:36| Okay. Item 45 was the one that was pulled, and it will be deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| Till next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Till next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| Will we pass that without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| That's what we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| We'll need that motion when that item comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| Item 46 is ready, and my miscommunication with the law department, it didn't get put in the packet today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=839)|
| 0:14:07| So, if you could, we could defer that to next Monday, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=847)|

| 0:18:41| which damages occurred as a result of KUB's construction activities for the South Loop Phase 2 project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| and authorizing the use of $300,000 from KUB's payment to Knotts County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1128)|

| 0:19:17| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| Doug Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Do you have a copy of this for all the other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| To explain it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| They haven't seen it before, have they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| It should have been in everyone's package, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Given the proposed acquisition budget and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| I mean, we're going to come out, you know, about zero on the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| and wind up with a really good deal down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| which will close off the two entrances on Alcoa Highway to a less-than-desirable park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1189)|
| 0:20:04| Anyway, if anybody wants to see this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Commissioner Brown just pointed out a lot of what I wanted to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| is it's a very underutilized park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| and with the entrance coming in on the backside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| there will be a lot more control of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| and I think we'll get a lot more utility out of this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| And it is basically a net-zero swap here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| You're using money from a past project that you've never done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| leveraging some funds from KUB and also Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| So I think we're going to wind up with a really nice park out there that everybody can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| Yeah, and if I might add, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| that one of the key concerns here is the access on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| We have two entrance exits on Alcoa Highway that are very dangerous on the outside of a curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| where I believe the speed limit is about 55, and they're probably going 65 or 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| So as TDOT redoes the road down there, too, it's going to be even harder access into IC King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| So this will eliminate a really, really very dangerous situation in the park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| Doug, what will happen with the access from Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| especially the one that goes so far back in there where there have been problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Eventually we will close both those accesses off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Again, that will improve the safety there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Have a very open parking lot off Marable Pike, which, again, will be right on Marable Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| We'll have lots of eyes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| We've already had the Mountain Bike Club express interest in building new trails there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| so it will give us an opportunity to provide new amenities to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| As you can see in the packet, too, we only have 90 percent of our parkland in South Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| so certainly an area of need that allows us to fix numerous problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| and provide better service in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| Will that existing road be torn up, or will the asphalt lay there still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| We'll probably keep it there because, again, hikers, walkers, runners, mountain bikers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| will still be able to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| So I think we'll just let that be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| It would be pretty expensive to tear it all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| So I think we'll probably just incorporate it in the trail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| And the new parking will be right off of Marable Pike back there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Just right north of Kara's Gardens or Kara's Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Yes, you know, I also serve on the Parks and Rec Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| and they've been talking about this for a month or so, so I knew it was coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| And I just want to applaud Doug and his staff, what they've done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| This has taken a situation where I see King Park is so—I drove by there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| It's such a dangerous in and out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Even trying to get out, it's almost blind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| And this is going to be such a great safety factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| It's going to make this park—I've seen the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Be sure you look at your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| And I've driven by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| This is just a great thing for South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| and I just really applaud you making this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| This is, like you said, it's coming out like a net zero of what it's going to cost the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| It's just a great thing that you've done here, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1386)|

| 0:25:16| It will be in the form of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I said earlier I'd like to add a resolution to sponsor the Smoky Mountain Air Show 2016 in the amount of $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1522)|

| 0:25:39| I don't mind to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| I just think it's wise to see it before you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Thank you, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Motion is before us to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1551)|

| 0:25:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Okay, we're on item 50, update and discussion regarding the hotel motel tax collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1561)|
| 0:26:10| Mr. Foster Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Foster D. Arnett, Jr., Knox County Clerk 1236 Forest Brook Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| I'll give you a quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| I did this earlier today at the audit committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| We have collected about half of what is outstanding right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| I have personally met with all the hoteliers who are in arrears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| As a matter of fact, one just came in between the last meeting and this meeting and wrote us a check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| and he has promised full payment within 90 days and is very concerned about our enforcement efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| as well he should be so he can get all of his taxes paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| I heard yesterday on Sunday from a major property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| We've been back in touch with this individual to talk about the taxes that they owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| I have met and will continue to meet with Daniel Sanders, Bud Armstrong, and David Buch in the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| because we want to make sure we follow the law on each and every property the proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| We're going through all the processes set out by TCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| and I think I'd be remiss if I didn't say thank you to Chris Caldwell and Dr. Joe Carsello,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| the chairman of the audit committee, who have put a stamp on approval of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| I was contacted last Thursday quite by surprise by Kevin Kane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| who is the CEO and president of the Memphis Convention and Visitors Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| Mr. Kane said he had been reading in the paper about what we're doing in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| and wanted to mirror it in Shelby County to see if they could help collect their $40 million in hotel-motel taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1665)|
| 0:27:55| We're focusing on the properties identified in the recent audit, 110 hotel and motel files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| We're also looking to see if there's any more outstanding accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| We are in the process right now of speaking with Mr. Caldwell to find out the best path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| about bringing on an auditor or two, possibly on board in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| And the hotel-motel industry definitely has gotten my message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| which is if you owe Knox County taxes, you need to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| If not, we will continue our actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| I want to point out that the majority of the hoteliers in Knox County do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| and pay their taxes on time, and we're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| Basically, if there are taxes out there that need to be paid to Knox County, we will collect those taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| We are in various processes in collecting those taxes, working again with Daniel Sanders in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| Bud, thank you for Daniel and his help, and thank you for you and David and your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| With that, there's not a whole lot I can say, but I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| This afternoon, Mr. Arnett went into a good 45-minute discussion with the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| of things that are being looked at, worked on, changed, not just in his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| but as it relates to the audit committee in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| Commissioner Brown, would you like to add anything to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| Yeah, just in a comical way, Foster's message was, answer from some of these folks was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| it ain't never been explained to me that way before, but he has got some good results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| and good reactions to it, and he gave us a couple of examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| and one guy was kind of shaking in his boots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| He said, well, it should have been, but I think we're on the right track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| and I think the audit committee would agree that we agree that he does need to get an auditor in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1791)|
| 0:29:59| specifically to work on the hotel motels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| My opinion is that having a person who does that continually can do it faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1804)|
| 0:30:13| because they've done it before, they're going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| Also, they're more in tune with the trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| If they do it, if that's their job, they're more in tune with the trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| Are we getting enough out of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| We have to go strictly on what they report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Now, if they report that their rooms were down this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| we can go to visit Knoxville and say, hey, did we not have any conventions this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| They say, well, yeah, we did, and we maybe need a chance to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| That's the one you need to go back and audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| It gives us a lot better, the foster's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| a lot better opportunity to protect the taxpayers' money in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| I think we're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Mr. Thomas, Mike, you and Dave are on that audit committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Are you talking about an auditor that would just strictly be on hotel motel auditing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| Well, it took our internal auditor two weeks to do one of the ones that she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| If we tried to audit them every three to four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| every three years that would be 37 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| You don't have 74 weeks in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| So I think, in my opinion, that once the word gets around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| that we have somebody that's doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| and I figure that if one person stays with that job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| it may be that their work will slack up enough they can do other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| But primarily I think that should be that person's job to know the hotel motels inside and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1910)|
| 0:31:58| and whether they're having a good month or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| There's various ways of checking to see what the occupancy was in town for the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| And they'll have access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| But if one person does it, it's not somebody reinventing the wheel every week or every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| If it's a new person, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| I sat in on the audit committee today, and I agree with Commissioner Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| and I suppose you agree with this too, Chairman Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| that it would be a good idea for Foster to hire an auditor within his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| I think this is a job that after someone gets a learning curve down, the efficiency of it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| they can do this at a frequency enough rate to hit those 37 every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| And also with the learning curve, they'll be able to decipher trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| on which ones they actually need to go back and audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| I know it will come with a cost, but I think in the long run it'll save us money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| because we don't know exactly how much money isn't collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| because there hasn't been audits going on in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| And as for Mr. Arnett, I was really pleased to see your attitude today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| your aggressiveness at the approach that you're taking towards this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Just please keep up the good work, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Seeing no further comments on this item, next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2008)|

| 0:34:11| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| The next item was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| It's a discussion regarding the time and date for the Rules Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| I was on vacation last week, but I took these rules with me and read over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| You can see how dull my vacation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| But there's a number of things we need to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| and I wanted to know with the people that are on the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| which would be Broyles, Smith, Anders, and Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| if you have a date or a time that we could sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| and discuss some of the changes we may need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| I think it would be, I think the way that would probably have to come is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| you'd have to submit those to the Rules Committee chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| The Rules Committee chairman would call the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| and then we'd have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| They'd have to set an agenda to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Just submit them to, who's the chairman of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Oh, you're the chairman of the Rules Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| I thought you, oh, you said you're on it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Well, you call the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Well, what I'm trying to do is get a discussion going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| to see when it's available for the committee to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| to go over some of the things that I've checked off here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| and see if there's any agendas that you want to read on the rules that could be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| I don't know who was first, Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| McKenzie was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I guess my question is, are we talking about a rewrite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| or are we talking about discrete things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| we'll talk about the, I don't know, makeup or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| So are we just going to have a general meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| Well, what I was thinking about is get the Rules Committee together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| which are five members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| We look over some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| If you'll get your rules out, take a look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| See if we are following the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| and if there are some tweaks that we need to make to the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| let's make them and bring them before the full body to discuss these rule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| And we'd like to do it sometime between, well, if we have to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| and the only time we can do it is before a regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| it would be next month in October, hopefully before the Workshop Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| And we got finance next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| We got finance at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| We'll do it after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Finance meeting is probably going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Just a moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Usually the best time for committees to meet, it seems to be the right before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| and sometimes right after a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| So if there's another great meeting before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| we might come meet right after the Work Session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| or right after our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| It seems like Rules Committee just this past year went over the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| Mike Lettice and that went over the rules with a fine-tooth comb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| and completely updated them and changed a whole bunch of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| So I can't imagine that there would be a whole lot that would need to be redone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| at this point after having just gone through that process in the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| But just wanted to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I can't imagine that there's a whole lot after what Mike Lettice through last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| But I'm open to meeting any time before or after a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| That always seems to work well for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| How about following the Work Session in October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2271)|
| 0:38:00| Commissioner Busler, are you the chair of the Rules Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Are you calling a meeting of the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| following the Work Session of next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Which would be how long does the Finance Committee normally meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| No, after the Work Session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| After the Work Session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| We'll do it after the Work Session, immediately following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Not on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| This is a discussion item that was added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| regarding Commissioners Busler, Brantley, and Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| attending the Tennessee County Services Association meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| Commissioner Busler and Brantley and myself are interested in attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| the fall conference for the Tennessee County Services Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| Commissioner Busler and I attended the summer conference they had in Pigeon Forge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| and I felt that the benefits were outstanding from an educational standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| And we've been encouraged to go to the fall conference as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| and Commissioner Brantley would like to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| So, since this is new for us, as far as the travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2362)|
| 0:39:30| and the registration fees and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| I have before me a printout of the budget of Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| which has remaining $13,000 plus for education, for Commission education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2378)|
| 0:39:48| Do you have an estimate of the amount that this, what's this going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| Charles, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| I think the registration fee is only like, isn't it $125 or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| It's $125 plus the rooms that you could already book now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| and I'm not sure what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| I left my information at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| But the thing of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Certainly wouldn't be approaching $13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| It's not going to be $13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| I just want you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Maybe $12,500, but not $13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| They're going to eat well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| No, I went last year, and I tell you, I'm a cheap person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| and I went last year to Murfreesboro on my own money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| so you know it's not expensive for me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| And I drove down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| I saw what was going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| I met a lot of good people, did a lot of good networking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| and they have a lot of committees that we can be on that we can put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| We have a legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| We have an education committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| and there are some other things that we can get ourselves set up to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| represented on those committees so we can work with other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| and see how they're doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I'd just like to commend you all for getting active and traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| There was a big brouhaha amongst the commission a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| about no one wanted us to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| We were spending taxpayer dollars like we were going to places on a boondoggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| This is work, as you all now know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| So it really is refreshing to see that commission has taken a turn toward the better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| in terms of continually trying to educate ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| and getting involved in these processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| In my estimation, if we need to amend our budget, we need to amend our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| because, again, within the governmental rules, there's a per diem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| and there's a mileage, and the cost is going to be what the cost is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| But I would hate for us to send two when three would want to go to a place like Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| So I just encourage us to continually educate ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| as well as network with other people in similar positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Also, next month is the annual—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Was I over five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Did you get cut off, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| Next month is also the annual Tennessee Economic Council on Women's annual conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| which I go to every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| It's usually the fourth Sunday and Monday of the month, and it's in Nashville every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2543)|
| 0:42:30| So I've already put in a request to travel to that again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| It's something that I attend every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| I always bring back a tremendous amount of beneficial information in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| particularly as it pertains to 50 percent of our county population here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| And that's something that's never very expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| because I end up staying with my aunt who lives out there instead of paying for a hotel room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| and, of course, renting a car, which saves us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| But it's always incredibly valuable, so that's coming up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| So I'm also delighted to see more commissioners who want to take advantage of traveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| and learning and bringing back new ideas and new things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| So I'm really, really glad to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| I am late right now for getting to a sector plan meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| I understand that, but this meeting, this was an added agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| and I think we need to allow Common Courtesy would allow us to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| So I just think it's not proper for us to be cutting commissioners off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2616)|
| 0:43:44| Mr. Chairman, I think for planning purposes, this trip to Murfreesboro for the three of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| I'm budgeting or looking at something like $225 a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| So no more than $250, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| Would you guys agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| So I don't think there's no airfare involved or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| So, you know, if the county doesn't want to pay, I'll pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| I'll be real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| If you guys are planning to rent a car and all three travel together to save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| we might be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| What are you doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Discussion on this added agenda item of educational expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| Well, normally that's approved by the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And the chair would request that you give me some report on what you learned when you get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2677)|
| 0:44:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Further discussion on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150921?start=2692)|
