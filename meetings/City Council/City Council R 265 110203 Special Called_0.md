| 0:00:00| It's time to start the part two of this meeting. We've already had our invocation and our pledge, so I'm going to turn this over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=0)|
| 0:00:15| Well, let's call the roll again. We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=15)|

| 0:00:32| Councilman Woodhull. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=32)|
| 0:00:34| All right, we're all present and accounted for, and we'll turn this meeting over now to Mr. Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=34)|
| 0:00:42| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| As you all know, we've been working together over the last few days to try to put together a set of rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=43)|
| 0:00:51| or a set of procedures that we would follow for the purpose of accomplishing the election of a vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=51)|
| 0:00:57| and I think we have reached a set of rules that will work for you, but if you will listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=57)|
| 0:01:04| I would like to go through those, and then if you want to make any changes to those, then we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| But assuming that you want to go with what we've talked about so far, it would include the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| First, council would have an opportunity to discuss the qualifications of the vice mayor if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| The next thing that would happen is the city recorder would call the roll of the members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| She would seek a response to the question, are you willing to be considered for the position of vice mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| When called upon, each council member would respond with either yes or no in response to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| After those council members who have expressed a willingness to be considered for the vice mayor's position have been identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=99)|
| 0:01:46| then each such member would be permitted to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| There would be council discussion and questions permitted during that period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| after the council member would be allowed to make a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| and then you could follow up with discussion related to that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| Following the statements of the council members willing to be considered and any related council discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| then you would start the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| The first round of voting would be conducted by the city recorder calling the roll of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| with each member responding by stating the name of the person for whom that council member wishes to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=136)|
| 0:02:22| If any council member receives five votes, that member would be elected as vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| If no member receives five votes in the first round of voting, then you would proceed to the next round of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| I think that what we've talked about is after five rounds of voting, if no member has been selected as the vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| you all will discuss a process or adopting a process whereby the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| or persons receiving the lowest number of votes would be eliminated from consideration in the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| Voting would then be concluded when an applicant has five or more votes at the conclusion of any round of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| Are there any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| Would you like to discuss any other changes to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| Ms. Palmer, I can't tell you why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| I'd like to make the motion to adopt these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| This would be a motion to suspend the rules and adopt these in lieu of Robert's rules of order for the purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| accomplishing the election of a vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Ayes have it and so are it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| Mr. Mitchell, are you ready to call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| Actually, we need to determine whether council wants to discuss the qualifications of a vice mayor before we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=227)|
| 0:03:56| Is there any discussion relative to the qualifications you're looking for in a vice mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| You all are familiar with how a vice mayor operates and that the vice mayor serves essentially as the chief administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| officer of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Does anyone want to have a discussion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| I couldn't see your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Thank you, Mayor and Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| This body, during the time that I have served on city council, has had two excellent vice mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| And I've been thinking about the qualities that they brought to this body that made them good leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=271)|
| 0:04:39| And you're trying to lead a body of leaders, which in and of itself can be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| You talk about too many chiefs and not enough Indians sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| And so I think in that vein, this body has worked well with a servant leader who sees him or herself as a consensus builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=289)|
| 0:05:02| and someone who very much values shared leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| Again, all nine of us were equally elected to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| And I think we work the best and the most effectively when we work as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| And sometimes that means dividing up leadership responsibilities and knowing that, for example, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| Mayor Brown has covered issues relating to Knoxville area transit and has been able to report back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| Because realistically, all of us can't be everywhere all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| I think also we know that in these chambers we have occasions when we face really difficult, wrenching decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| And we're not always going to end up on the same side of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| And we're certainly not always going to be able to satisfy everyone that comes to petition us in these chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=350)|
| 0:05:58| And I think it's critically important that the vice mayor is a leader in exercises in trust building and relationship building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=358)|
| 0:06:10| I know when I first came on council seven years ago, we added the opportunity to share a meal together once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| And I think those of us that have been in this group for that amount of time feel like that exercise has reaped some dividends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=377)|
| 0:06:25| that there's an opportunity to visit informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| It certainly sunshines that we operate within the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| And, you know, we don't deliberate about matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| We just talk about the weather and our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| But it gives us an opportunity to share one another's lives in a way that when we come around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| and an issue has the potential to be incredibly divisive, at the end of the day we can debate fairly and debate civilly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=403)|
| 0:06:52| and then go home and still be able to convene again as a respectful body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| In a nutshell, those are the values that I think are important that this person bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| Mr. Bailey and then Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| And I appreciate Councilman Roddy's remarks, but I guess there's three responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| primary responsibilities that the vice mayor has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| And one is to represent the council and to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| And so they've got to be willing to take the time to understand the will of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| and to represent that to the administration and to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| Secondly, I think that they need to understand the city recorder's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| and to be willing to be courteous and respectful of their responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| And then again, I guess, and that's really important to me because I respect the ladies in the city recorder's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=470)|
| 0:08:00| and they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| And then I guess lastly, the vice mayor needs to be prepared to represent the city in the absence of the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=482)|
| 0:08:12| and that city functions when the mayor even is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| So that's traditionally been the responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| And I think highly of all of you and I look forward to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| I agree with both Councilwoman Roddy and Councilman Bailey's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| I'd like to stress that I would hope that the vice mayor will represent the will of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| And as Councilman Roddy pointed out, by obtaining consensus, and I know that we are sunshined on what we do all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| but I also think that listening is a really key skill for the person who's going to be our vice mayor to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=527)|
| 0:08:56| So I agree with both Councilman Roddy and Councilman Bailey, probably Councilman de la Vogue, but I can't read his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=536)|
| 0:09:04| Councilman de la Vogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| I just had sort of a question and or suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| I'm wondering about the duration of this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| We're going to have four new city council people come end of next December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| and I wonder whether we have to take a second look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I don't know whether this is for the term until we get a new body here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| but that would make a lot of sense to me that we at least look again after we have the full council sitting that's been reconstituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| Absent something extraordinary happening, this would be the remainder of the term, which would be until December, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| We would have an election of a new vice mayor after we elect a new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| Satisfies my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Thank you for that, Councilman de la Vogue, because I think especially for the public who may be watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| that's a good question to ask how long the term will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=593)|
| 0:10:01| I don't see any further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| I guess, Ms. Mitchell, we're ready to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| This would be in response to the question, are you willing to be considered for the position of vice mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=619)|

| 0:10:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=631)|

| 0:10:34| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=634)|

| 0:10:36| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=636)|

| 0:11:06| I'd like to make your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| I look at this as I'm willing to do this and I just think it's an extension of my service and I would be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Well, I would just like to say that I think it's very important to bring experience to the position of vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=678)|
| 0:11:27| as I began my tenth year of service as a councilperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| I've been elected twice in an at-large position and once, you know, out of a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| And so, you know, I feel like that, you know, obviously if you've been elected three times that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| the will of the people has spoken and they trust me in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| And I think that that's a huge task to earn that trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| So I think that that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| Continuity, as alluded to, I mean, obviously we have a new mayor in position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| and I would however that mayor would want to utilize, you know, the vice mayor or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| I would be willing to do whatever, as much as possible to help or as little as possible to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| depending on the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| But obviously there are times when the mayor does have to be out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| and for whatever reasons that I would be happy to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| Hopefully you all have seen my ability to run a meeting as chair of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| I think it's very important that you know that that person deals with a level hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| is courteous to the people that come visit us in our chambers because a lot of times it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| it's very difficult for folks to come and be on TV and be in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| So I hope I've exhibited that I'm, you know, that I can do that, that I can run a meeting efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| because there may be times, you know, when I have to do it, when that person would have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| So in closing, I don't want to be real long, but, you know, I think experience really counts in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=781)|
| 0:13:09| I hope that you know I'm a hard worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| I do whatever it takes in my district and throughout the city, you know, to work hard when I hold this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| I have the business experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| I understand what it takes to run a business in a business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| I've had that experience for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| And just most of all to work with the folks that work in the office to make it work with efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=806)|
| 0:13:35| and that, you know, the citizens of the city of Knoxville serve well out of that and to make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| just to make the folks of the city proud of the city council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| So that's what I bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=824)|
| 0:13:56| I'd like to make a statement if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| I'm not running for the office, but I'd like to make a statement that both of these two councilmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| it's going to be a hard choice, but I would look forward to working with either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| That's the statement I'm trying to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=855)|

| 0:15:43| So, Ms. Mitchell, if you would call the roll again, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Just by a commission, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Well, we have a unanimous vote, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=953)|

| 0:15:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| I'm going to turn this over to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=960)|

| 0:16:28| Mr. Swanson, I'm going to turn this over to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| We really have not talked about how to do this, and so unless we decide to do otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| you could use Robert's Rules of Order in order to accomplish this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| and that would be simply someone making a motion that someone be nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| What has happened more often historically than anything else is the presiding officer asks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| if anyone is interested in filling that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Typically, we have rarely had more than one person raise their hand to want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| but if we do have more than one person, then we can decide how to conduct that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Is anyone interested in serving on the CAT Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| No one is interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| You're still a councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| You can keep that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Well, I would like to make a nomination if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Would that be proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| It would be proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| I'd like to nominate Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| He said he'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| He actually has the experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| He's worked with CAT in the past and would be a great friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Well, the ayes have it, and so ordered, and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| I think you'll do fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| I don't believe we have any other business to come before us, so this meeting is now adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265110203specialcalled?start=1084)|
