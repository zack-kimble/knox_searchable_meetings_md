| 0:21:13| If you take the two and a half percent away, we're going to be right back where we were in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| And I'm pretty sure she'll vouch for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| But I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I want to thank you all for the budget and the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| And thank you and look forward to working with you in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Next we have Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| If you'd come down, give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Mark Taylor, 720 Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| I'm the president of the local fraternal order, Please Volunteer Lodge 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| And I won't take nearly five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| While sometimes I may not see ideologically eye to eye with all members of council and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| I do appreciate the hard work that you do, and I appreciate your continued support of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| As you all know, when times get tight and tough, the job becomes harder out here for our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1327)|
| 0:22:16| and for our firefighters and other employees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| And that's kind of a necessary fact of that, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| We really appreciate the insight and the thought that you put into compensating us fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| and your continued support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| I'd also like to take this opportunity to invite each of you out to our Fraternal Order of Police Youth Summer Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1354)|
| 0:22:43| And what that program is, is we take and we allow officers to identify at-risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| and needy children in the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| We invite those kids out for a week of camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| We have two weeks each summer of a lodge in South Knoxville that we've paid for over the years that we take these guys to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| We have eight little cabins, four boys, four girl cabins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| We take about 100 kids a year normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| I think this year we're probably going to be more in the 70 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Times are a little tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| But it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| A lot of those kids will never have an opportunity to camp or do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| And it's a way to put a positive face and let them see that police officers are real people too and human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| And a lot of them don't get to see that out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| The first week is 6 through 10 June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| And the second week is 13 through 17 June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| It's a blast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| If nothing else, it's great to get out there and see those kids having some fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| So if you're interested in that, give me a holler and I'll make sure we get you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| I think we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| I just want to thank you, Mayor, on behalf of the council for a really good budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| And thank you to all your senior directors and for your directors for the great presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| And I was remiss the last time to thank Melissa Peters in the city council office for the work that she provides us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| and really the cheat sheet so that we're informed and on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| But I think we've acted responsibly and as good stewards on behalf of the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Melissa does an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I think we already have a second and a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| Motion B is an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties, real, personal, and mixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| within the corporate limits of the city of Knoxville to provide sufficient revenues to fund the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| and debt service fund operations and debt service obligations of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2011 and ending June 30, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Move and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| I just wanted to mention a very positive feature of this is that our fellows in finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| have found a way to take a portion of that tax rate and pay down some of our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| And that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| I think 25% or 60 cents of that $2.46 per hundred rate goes to paying down the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| And that helps lower the cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| So that's a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| And I wanted to applaud that and thank them for their effort and their foresight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| We can thank Mr. Jim York and his staff for the work that he does on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| We have a motion on the floor, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1541)|

| 0:25:43| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1544)|

| 0:26:07| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| 9D is an ordinance to amend Section 7.5-5 of the Knoxville City Code entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Councilmanic Districts within the City of Knoxville and to repeal all ordinances in conflict therewith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| I just had a comment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Sir, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Just a short comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| This is something we have to do every ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| And sometimes it's a little bit uncomfortable to say goodbye to some of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| and then welcome others in our respective districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| But I think that Rick Emmett and the folks did a really good job with the redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| There was no indication that it was done in any other fashion except very, very objectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Some of the geographical lines are a little bit neater than they used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| The folks that I'm speaking mainly because the Fifth District lost a little bit more boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| than the other districts, but it was because that we had had more growth except for one other district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| But this plan has been looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| It feels a little bit strange to be saying goodbye to our neighbors in Beaumont and Fairmont and Callaghan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| but we also would like to welcome the neighborhood of Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| But once again, I wanted to thank Rick Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| I think it was a really good job, and we'd move to approve this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| I appreciate what Councilman Thomas had to say, and thank Rick Emmett for his work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Thank you, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Well, if you're going to do that, you ought to thank Tim Coon, too, from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| who spent a lot of time doing the mapping, and they both worked together very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Councilman Thomas, is that your whole line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1661)|

| 0:27:46| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| 11B is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute agreement number 110056,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| project identification number 115585, with the Tennessee Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| as necessary to accept surface transportation program funding in the amount of $960,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| for the downtown Knoxville wayfinding project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| and to provide local matching funds in the amount of $240,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Councilman Dellavopit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| I have, as you can imagine, questioned the expenditure of $1.2 million for this wayfinding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| which is really a signage system to help us get around downtown, get our visitors around downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1712)|
| 0:28:40| and to use our facilities and find out what we have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| It is obviously an investment in tourism and in good hosting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| and to that extent I am very much in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| I still have to say I remain shocked that we can spend $1.2 million to put some signs up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| helping people get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| It may be that the world is more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| It has been explained to me by Ms. Wallace that part of this money goes to satisfying TDOT requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| on environmental and other criteria that almost don't fit putting up a sign as opposed to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| digging a ditch and affecting water courses and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| But be that as it may, I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Again, it looks like government spends more dollars than it needs to to get a job done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| but I have to defer to the staff's effort on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| I think it will help us in the long run as an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| While I appreciate my colleague's concern about spending taxpayer dollars wisely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| this is an effort, like many efforts in city government, that has been many, many years in the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| And a number of years ago, before Councilman Della Volpe was with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| we had an extensive workshop on this topic as we looked at the possibility of undertaking a wayfinding project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| It was a priority that was recommended by Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| We had a competitive process to select a provider for these signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| and we looked at what it takes to brand a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| and to make a community welcoming for visitors and easy to get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| There was a time when people couldn't figure out where to park downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| I think hopefully we've gotten around that somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| but still sometimes visitors to our community are confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| And if you travel throughout the city, you'll notice an inconsistency in our signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| We have the brown signs and we have the green signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| and we have the attraction signs and the parking signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| And what this will do is unify and brand what we're doing as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| and make it not only more friendly for visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| but I think we'll see a great deal of economic return on our investment with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| And certainly all tax dollars are contributed by all citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| but whenever we can leverage federal tax dollars in the manner in which we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I think it's all the more favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| So I'm in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I understand Councilman De La Vox's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| and this does seem like a fairly expensive amount of money to be spending for signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| But I also recall that at budget hearings we had quite a conversation about tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| and ways for people to find what we have to do in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| If you're in the convention, you're pretty well tied in, but if you're accompanying someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| I think this signage is a really positive step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| I was not here when the workshop was held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| but I do like the idea that we're going to have some consistency in the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| and that we are going to be able to brand our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| so that when people get here they see a polished city surrounded by these beautiful mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| and all the things that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| So while I understand Councilman De La Vox's concern about the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| I also understand that this is important for us to get our city in a good sign thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| make our tourists feel at home, because they do help our revenue bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1932)|

| 0:32:44| I guess that $35,000, what was the appraised value on that house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| I think that was the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| And they're comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=1976)|

| 0:33:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Been moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Yes, Mayor, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| Was an architect involved in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Or will be an architect involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| There was not an architect involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| Who is actually doing the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Actually doing the work, Rich Construction is doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Each of the people that wanted to bid on this were taken around to the fire stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| and shown the work that we wanted to do in constructing the new restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| And drawings were made and showed them what was expected of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| But, no, there was not an architect involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| An architect was not involved in the drawings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2051)|

| 0:34:58| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| I had a question on both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| What is the mileage requirement before we give up an automobile or put it up for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2102)|
| 0:35:11| Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Boyce Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Do I have, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Boyce Evans, 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| What we try to do is go with either five years or 80,000 miles on the Crown VIX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| You may see some in the future since, like I say, we've got, or mentioned one time previously during the budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| we've had two years' worth of Crown VIX that we bought at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| So you may see us, you know, some of them go for like 78,000 miles or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| But generally speaking, it's five years, 80,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| And, again, there's a point system based on the age of the vehicle, maintenance condition, miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| everything figured together, and Fleet works that with KPD in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| their liaison officer, to determine which ones to let go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| I was talking to some police folks in Lexington, and I know they try to get their vehicles to 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| So I didn't know if there was some rule of thumb or how Knoxville decided on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Yeah, as long as we're chatting about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| One of the things I notice in the information sheet is that we have somewhat of a limited marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| In other words, you just can't sell this vehicle to a member of the public because it's set up as a police vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| with markings and all that other stuff on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| That is correct for the fully marked vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| And this is one of those that we're talking about here, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Actually, both of these, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| These are fully marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| The only thing is I think one of them doesn't have the lights on it, but everything else is fully marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2216)|
| 0:37:03| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Some of us might want to get one of those interceptor engines and go tooling down the road, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| I'll just talk to Chief Roush about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| He'll probably stop us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2236)|

| 0:37:19| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with SEI Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2242)|

| 0:38:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Almost saved by the bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| I just wanted someone to say in English what a CBR&E other related equipment type thing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Is this working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| That's chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| You're going to say thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| I saw that and I thought that's an acronym that is hard to swallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| And, of course, you can have my aye on the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| I just wanted to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to file a grant application with the Department of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2325)|

| 0:39:45| between the City of Knoxville and Waste Connections of Tennessee, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| for the collection of household curbside single stream recyclable materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2388)|

| 0:39:56| for a projected annual cost of $987,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| I think we have some people that want to speak to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| I wanted to ask a question myself, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Yes, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| If Mr. Brace is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| David Brace, City Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Yes, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| I didn't see you there at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| This has a built-in escalation clause for each of the five years of this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| And it's 3.5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| It's a built-in CPI escalation clause that we use in our household garbage collection services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| So we're paying that now in the regular household garbage site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| It's fairly standard in solid waste to do a CPI with a cap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| and we've done that in household garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| We also do that in our yard waste processing contract, and it's included in this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| We pick up the yard waste, but we take it to a processor who does it by contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| The other item that's in there, and I didn't see a dollar limit on it, had to do with the repair service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2466)|
| 0:41:16| It said if they found damaged carts, if you will, they got a $15 fee plus the cost for the parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| Is there any monitoring of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| I mean, there wasn't an outside dollar limit up to X or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| Yes, the carts that the city has purchased, and we've got a team here, so it's not just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| We've got Waste Connections folks here that can answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| and Ms. Sutherland is also here to talk about the carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| But carts have a 10-year warranty, and typically in the first one to three or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| you have a limited breakdown on carts, but occasionally you have a lid or a wheel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| or another part that breaks down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| So Waste Connections would provide that service to the city for going out and maintaining those carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| We pay them to drive out and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| We provide the parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| And do you monitor the invoicing of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Typically a cart is called in to 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| We monitor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| We send it to them for the repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| They repair it, and then we occasionally would audit that to make sure that they're obviously keeping their books in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| with what they're reporting to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Okay, well, thank you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| I guess the final question in that regard is with the fuel, it doesn't have a fuel escalator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| but it says that they reserve the right to approach the city with fuel concerns during times of oil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| or fuel energy crisis on paragraph 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Can you tell me what has been the experience in the last several years on the last contract, the refuse contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| We don't have a recycle contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| I'll give you my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| I'm sure the contractor has a different opinion or concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| But just like us, fuel affects that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| It's a transportation business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Fuel has shot up and has been volatile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| We do not have a fuel surcharge in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| They wanted one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| I told them we wouldn't do that in our negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| But they asked for some language to at least approach us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| And I don't know if Mr. Mills or I guess legal could answer questions about the validity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| or the concern you may have about them coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| My question was what your experience was in the past contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| They've come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Waste Connections has come down and sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| When Mr. Wetzel was down there, they came and sat down with us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| hey, fuel shot up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| We don't have a fuel surcharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Will you pay us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| And we said, I bet that won't get by Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| And they said, well, we wanted to ask anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| So they have come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Fuel has shot up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| But there is no fuel surcharge in the contract, in our household garbage contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| in our yard waste collection contract, or in this proposed recycling contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| So that's an advantage for the city, not necessarily the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| You've left that open so that you can talk about it in the future if it becomes material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| Well, we sat down and negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| And that was a real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Fuel shot up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| And obviously concerns in the Middle East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| They're a fuel-driven business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| And so they asked for an actual surcharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| They wanted that in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| We told them that wasn't in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| They didn't put it in their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| But they did want some language to at least reflect their concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| And so we worked with city law to place that small sentence in there about fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Well, thank you very much for those responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| We have one person signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Emoja Abdul-Al-Had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| If you'd come down, give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| So you have someone with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Oh, he's passing out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Emoja Abdul-Al-Had, 614 West Hill Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| And it's quite an honor to be here on this occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| For 20-some odd years, we've been working in recycling with our organization, Project 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| and been to a lot of meetings where this was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| And finally, it looks like it's coming to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| And what we've said in the past is the only difference between a garbage truck and a recycle truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| the garbage truck is just misnamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| A garbage truck is actually a recycle truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| Our desire is to make Knoxville the recycle capital of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| For, as I said, two decades plus, we've been working with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| We started in 1989 in public housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| We were able to get 85% of the residents in public housing to recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| We went from Knoxville to Durham, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| We got 75% of the residents in those two cities to recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| I got elected to the National Recycling Coalition's Board of Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| and we took it to 35 cities in the United States and Puerto Rico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| Project 2000 wants to be a part of this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| I have made presentations in the past about being involved with recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| and we definitely want to be involved in all areas of recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| What happened two years ago is that State Senator Burchard, when he was a state senator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| and also Representative Joe Armstrong worked with us to get legislation passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| where we could have a specialty license plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| And on that license plate is going to have on it our recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| This license plate is the only one in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| So what you can say is that Knoxville has two things for sure that it's done no other place ever did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| When we started recycling in public housing, it was said it was impossible to organize multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| Public housing was invisible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| It wasn't even in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| They were talking about condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| They were talking about upscale housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Here in Knoxville, Tennessee, with the help of many organizations, the city of Knoxville, the county, KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| and other organizations, we were able to do the impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| I didn't say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Experts said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| They say it's impossible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| They were talking about upscale housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| I know I'm repeating myself, but I want to be sure you understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| They were talking about condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| They were talking about upscale housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Public housing was invisible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| So once again, Project 2000 wants to be a part of this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| I've talked with several people who were involved on several occasions, and I'm going to continue to talk with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| the city council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| We want to be a part of this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| We want to work here in Knoxville to develop this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| Presently, we're working with the University of Tennessee to see how we can manufacture items out of recycled fiber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2869)|
| 0:47:57| jobs, career, employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| We're also looking at how we can continue to educate the state about the value and the responsibility of recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2881)|
| 0:48:09| the value, the value and responsibility of recycling, because only 12% of the citizens in the state of Tennessee recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2889)|
| 0:48:19| So that means 88% goes into the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Also, we have as a mission to move recycling, the conversation from rhetoric to reality when it talks about green jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2903)|
| 0:48:31| Right now, it's just rhetoric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| You have to have the reality to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| So we want to be part of the team and educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| So that's what we're coming for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| We applaud this effort, all the different things that go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| I won't speak on each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| I have some consternation about some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| However, I want to be part of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| And sometimes when you're part of the team and you don't get the ball and the ball goes to someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| then they go ahead on and do whatever they need to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| That's part of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| But I seriously want to talk with each council member, talk with the mayor to see how we can be involved with this recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| and also how we can make this come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| Because with this, when we send 35K to Nashville, Tennessee, they send us 16 back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2952)|
| 0:49:22| They send us 16 back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| So that means we will be always having resources to do what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| And you won't have to ask all the questions about the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| Because we'll be self-sufficient in doing what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| We've been doing it for 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| We don't intend to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| And we want to be part of this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Thank you, Emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you for your years of work on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| I want to thank Emojo as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| And I'm hoping that Mr. Brace can answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| As I understand this whole approach, and it's in several different items on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| this recycled waste is going to be put in one cylinder per household, so to speak, taken to the curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| and then our waste contractor picks it up and takes it to a processor who separates the tin and the aluminum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3009)|
| 0:50:18| and the paper and the plastic and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| At that point, there are now materials that can be used and reused in industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| At that point, is not Mr. Emojo's group able to contract for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| and get materials to put into some productive reuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| I can't speak for Emojo, but I know Emojo will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| I think if you point them back, Rock 10, I'm going to ask these guys to raise their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| Rock 10 is a large processing facility here in Knoxville and in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| They'll tell you that, and I think this really bodes to what Emojo was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| is that the majority of the material that is collected and recycled and processed in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| gets used stateside, a lot of it regionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| Roofing manufacturers, Rock 10 is a division of a large paper company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| Excuse me, Rock 10 is a large paper company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| The materials, most of it stays here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| It gets used here and reused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Alcoa aluminum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| There is a huge, from an economic development standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| benefit to increasing the amount of materials that we recycle and stay here in the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| A small percentage does go overseas, and those guys can speak on that more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| I think when you look at solid waste in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| there are a number of, you know, there's private business, there's city government, there's KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| and it's a collective effort, and I think there may be opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| We have started to map our signups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| We're actually, at the last count, at 85-16 on our signups, which is just great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| We're really close to halfway, the halfway mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| We're starting to map where we may have areas that we need to do some concentrated communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3118)|
| 0:52:06| And I don't mind sitting down with Amosha and talking about ways that he could help us get out into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| and make connections out in the community, and we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| And are we also working with the chamber and people like that to maximize the business development opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| that might come from having these materials aggregated and available for reuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| We sat down with a number of stakeholders, and the services we provide are not services for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| So the chamber wasn't necessarily there to help us market the service because we don't want people to be confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| If they had a small business, they could sign up for the recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| But yeah, we sat down with Mr. Edwards and with Mr. Wegley and discussed the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| They were at the December 2009 workshop and spoke in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| Amosha was there as well and spoke in support of the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| and its benefit from an economic development standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| So yes, they are aware. They are supporters from the business end. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| Well, I hope you will consider small businesses as you go forward and develop this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| Yeah, definitely, and I think a great example is Curved Edge Consulting is a small woman-owned business that we hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3189)|
| 0:53:16| when I say we, the city, hired to provide all of our communications, PR, printing, marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| So we definitely have tapped into that in our communications end of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| and that was up to a $100,000 contract. So good point. Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| Moji, did you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| No, I was going to address the Councilman's point, but David addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| But I would be remiss if I didn't give everybody our website, www.irecyclecampaign.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| because I know the citizens are watching, but this is a participation that could happen and should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| And then the final thing, because when I say I want to make Knoxville the recycled capital of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| I'm not just saying that as a slogan. Someplace has to be the recycled capital of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| Someplace has to do that. Why not us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| And then we're always talking about employment. So for the next 50 years to the next 100 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| this is what we're going to be talking about green, recycling, environmental stewardship, urban, whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3251)|
| 0:54:20| So we should get serious about this. And I'm not saying we're not, so I'm not casting aspersions on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| But I'm just saying that for 22 years, I have watched it to see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| And so we have a history of, you know, a legacy as it relates to how this can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| And as I said earlier, being a part of the team, I feel like we can contribute a major contribution to making this come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| David, let me ask you in terms of public relations or what have you, I don't know if you get young people to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3284)|
| 0:54:53| they can very well help parents. Do we have any type of thing in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| Are we working with the schools in terms of education when it comes to recycling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| Yeah, it's a great point. We mapped where we have signups, and we found that there were some gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3303)|
| 0:55:11| Beaumont is one community we had some gaps. Five Points was an area we had gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| And Lonsdale was a huge kind of donut hole when you look at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| So have gone to Lonsdale Elementary and dropped off material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| We also attended, there was a community meeting there that we went to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| And we also had, there was a Lonsdale event, and the name is eluding me right now, last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| And we provided material at that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| My son goes to Beaumont, so I've already dropped off material at Beaumont and talked with the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| So, yes, we're reaching out to the schools, especially obviously those schools where we're seeing gaps in service delivery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| or excuse me, signups at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3352)|
| 0:56:01| All right. Thank you. Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| Chair, we entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| Move the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| It's been moved and properly seconded. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Ayes have it. So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| 11L is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a purchase order with Toter, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| to purchase 10,542 recycling bins for the city's new curbside recycling program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| at a total cost to the city of $572,360.50 to be paid for through the ARA grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3397)|
| 0:56:46| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| It's been moved and properly seconded. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Ayes have it. So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| 11M is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a purchase order with Waste Connections, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| to purchase 3,323 used recycling carts, which are currently in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| by Knoxville residents for a total price of $127,071.52,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| of which $27,639.50 is through ARA grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Not particularly on this item, but this item raises the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| We are buying the used carts, I think there's 3,300 of them and some change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| for $38.24 because some of their useful life has already expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| And we're buying new carts, and I want to say that we don't have the numbers in front of me now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| but I want to say that those were in the order of magnitude of $50 or $60 per cart as part of this mass purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3461)|
| 0:57:49| Later on in this same agenda, we have some definitions and changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| and ordinance requirements that hit a taxpayer homeowner with a $75 charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| if the cart is lost, damaged, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| And I was just curious why they were being charged more than sort of the cost of doing business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| Maybe someone can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| That $75 charge is also in many ways a punitive charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| but it's a charge to remind folks that if they move, they shouldn't take their cart with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| If a cart is damaged or if a cart is stolen and it wasn't the homeowner's fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| and they report it to us, we're going to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| But there is some language in there about $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| If they willfully destroy, burn, damage, or steal a cart, then there is a charge for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| And the process for that is we're not buying that cart in bulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| We're going to have to buy that cart, deliver it, pick up the old cart, and that's why there's more of a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| You're buying them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| You're Wal-Mart buying a big load of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| And if you buy a onesie, it's more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Been moved and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| 11N is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment to contract number CO20162| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| between the city of Knoxville and Waste Connections of Tennessee, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| which would allow one five-year extension to the contract to modify the backdoor collection services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| and to modify the rates paid by the city for an estimated annual savings to the city of $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| I had a discussion earlier with Steve King and also mentioned to David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| A concern that I have is how are we going to notify those folks who do have backyard pickup service at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3573)|
| 0:59:43| that we're really doing away with that except for the elderly and the handicapped the way that I read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| And so, David, if you could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| I know that I've had some calls concerning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| And I do realize there's been four public meetings, but we also know how public meetings go with people showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| So there is a concern in terms of how we're going to notify those folks that do have backdoor pickup service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| Great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Communication with our customers is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| The proposal, assuming everything passes tonight, is we've drafted a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| We've worked with Curved Edge, with Ms. Ball, the owner of Curved Edge, to draft a letter that is concise but communicates the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3621)|
| 1:00:29| It is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| Many people have backdoor garbage collection and may not know that it is an extra service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| What is the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| I've got the exact total here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| It's approximately 14,500 and some odd households out of 60,000 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| And so we have a draft letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| When our team met with each council member, we assured you we would let you see that letter before it went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| The letter has my signature on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| So in my phone number, obviously I'm the person that folks are going to call, but they're also going to contact you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| So the letter essentially communicates the change, why the change has been made or will be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3663)|
| 1:01:11| And then there's options for the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| The customer can request the medical age requirement application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| They can make a decision they don't want backdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| Fine, I'll take it to the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| They can let us know they want to sign up for the subscription service with Waste Connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| And then we're also going to give them an opportunity to sign up for recycling at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| So that letter is, I mean, I've always said is a critical component to this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| because it's our touch to our customers about a major change to their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| So we'll let you see that, assuming things pass tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| Are there certain areas that where having the person take their garbage to the road might cause a hazard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| you know, such as Kingston Pike, this sort of areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| I mean, I think when you look at any waste collection, there are always hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| We pick up brush and leaves on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| When we do that, we have to implement measures that are appropriate to keep both the public and our personnel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| Fire and police department do the same thing on car accident scenes or medical quick response scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| Waste Connections, our garbage contractor, does the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| It is in their contract to do and to provide those services in a way that doesn't jeopardize the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| So, yes, Kingston Pike has folks that, you know, travel at a relatively high rate of speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| And so they'll have to deal with that in the way that they do their garbage collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| just like they would on a curvy road or other busy roads where they pick up garbage, just like we do for brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| Well, Mr. Green, I think, raised the question that was on my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| and that is there are some 14,000 folks that will be affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| And a question has arisen as to whether or not there is any provision in these agreements to set the rate that they will have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3777)|
| 1:03:08| for the backdoor service or whether they're going to have to negotiate individually with your contractor, Waste Connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| Maybe you or the Waste Connection individual can tell us how that's going to be handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| because that will affect their personal expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| Yes, and I've just pulled our May invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| There's 14,742 residential backdoors, so that's the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3805)|
| 1:03:34| This amendment essentially gets the city out of backdoor service for folks that don't have a medical or age requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3814)|
| 1:03:45| So it is a subscription service between a private contractor and a customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| We will be providing the initial touch for sign-up, but once we turn that list over to Waste Connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3831)|
| 1:04:00| it will be a subscription service with Waste Connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| So they will obviously have that relationship with the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| If fuel prices go to $10 a gallon, backdoor garbage collection charges will probably go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| I won't say we negotiated, we communicated about that initial cost, the 875.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3857)|
| 1:04:26| And I've asked that question, how long is that going to be in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| I don't want that to happen and a month later the rates go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| Waste Connections has said in the foreseeable future, in the next 12 months, they don't see that going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| But if fuel goes up $7 or $8, they're going to come to us, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| and they're also going to come to their customers and make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| I will say, and I think I communicated this in the email, 875, if you look at backdoor service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| is a very reasonable rate when compared to the county or other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| which is typically $30 to $40 some odd dollars per household on top of the garbage collection rate per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3899)|
| 1:05:07| But to answer your question, we're out of the backdoor garbage business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| and that would be between the customer and Waste Connections in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| Would it be permissible for them to comment on that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| Because it affects our citizens and we're going to hear about it if they're unhappy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| so it would be nice to know what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| And perhaps you do this in Oak Ridge or other places already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| Yeah, and this I'll introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| Doug McGill has been a longtime sales slash operations person for both Waste Connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| and all of the waste hauler entities that have been providing services to the city for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| So Doug can comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| Oak Ridge, I just want, since you brought up Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Oak Ridge, you know, most cities either provide backdoor and pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| Oak Ridge does that, and I believe their rate is in the $13 a household range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| $15, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| Or they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Now, everybody provides it for medical necessary folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Oak Ridge made that decision many years ago to provide everybody with backdoor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| but it costs a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| So, but Doug can comment on the $8.75 and any potential rate increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| Without further ado, Doug, give it to the councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Councilman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Our intentions are this, and we've discussed this, and we'll be, it's not reduced to writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| but our intentions are to tie the CPI adjustment once a year that's capped at I think it's 3.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| We intend to do the $8.75 along the lines with the 3.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| The only times it would be an exception, if we had a problem with oil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| and then we'd come back to David and discuss it with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| and inform him so he can make information available to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| But we intend to do just like the contractual part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| is that we're going to try to tie it in at the 3.5% cap each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| So we're trying to play fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| I wanted to just hear what your approach was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| So the homeowner contracts directly with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| The city's out of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| The city gets out of the extra backdoor business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| It becomes a private service through Waste Connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| I know there was a question, why is it $8.75 if the city is only getting charged $8.09?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| When they bill us, they get a check every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| It's essentially guaranteed once we review and audit the invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| Obviously, if they have subscription services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| one, they don't know how many people are going to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| So they have some real risk by guaranteeing us half a million in savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| and kind of rolling the dice that, A, they can sign people up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| B, they can bill people and get money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| I mean, they carry between 10% and 15%, I'm sure, on collectibles on their books all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| So that is why that rate is higher than the city rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| I know that question came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| I hope that's clear as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| The other question I have is, does Councilman Della Vopi qualify for elderly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Apparently, I'm too young, but you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| What is the age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| The age is, and I can send the form to you, it's 75 or older,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| or you can have a doctor sign that you have a medical necessary requirement or a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4086)|
| 1:08:13| Most communities are at 2% to 3% of their households are medically necessary households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| Since we had this backlog for many years, we went ahead and bumped ours to 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| That's actually what's in the existing contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| and has been for many years with Waste Connections, previously BFI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| But 75, I don't think Councilman Della Vopi qualifies, but not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4111)|
| 1:08:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Hope I make it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| David, let me ask you about this 14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| I had a call from a person in my district, but where are most of those back doors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| Is it a certain section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Is it spread out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Where is most of it located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| It's typically in more suburban neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| You know, if you look at the city, it's kind of a donut where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| They wrap around into, it's from Holson Hills to North Hills to West Hills, Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4145)|
| 1:09:13| South is a little sparse, but you go out to some of the suburban neighborhoods on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| and there are some communities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| So it's more of the suburban communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| and then more of the medically necessary are in the traditionally gridded areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| But that's the breakout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| It's kind of spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| It's spread out, but it's typically suburban households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| I see Councilwoman Malone is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| and she has a definite view, former Councilwoman Malone from the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| She has some definite views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| If you would allow her to speak for a few minutes on the issue, she might enlighten us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| First of all, let me say I'm in favor of recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| That's not the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| Second of all, as Mr. Brace pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| the cost charged by waste connections is higher when they're not dealing with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4218)|
| 1:10:26| when they're dealing with individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| because they assume a risk that people may not pay their garbage bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| And one can see why they would build into their fee something that would cover them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4233)|
| 1:10:41| for the slow checks or the no checks that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| But at the same time, what's troublesome, as Mr. Brace also points out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| if you compare what we're paying with the county, which is an individual subscription,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| we're getting a great bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| Well, we're getting a great bargain because it's a city contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| The problem that has been set up with this, and I think if you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| and I've been told, and I don't know if it's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| but I've been told that the backdoor service was part of an annexation deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| when certain areas like Fountain City and perhaps Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| were annexed into the city in the early, in the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| But if you look at what's being crafted here with this hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| where the city pays Waste Connections $6.39 a month for curbside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4283)|
| 1:11:32| but then it is up to the individual homeowner to contract with Waste Connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4292)|
| 1:11:40| for them to come up the driveway if you want to keep backdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| The problem is I don't have the ability to negotiate as the city would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| No individual does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| I don't know why the city didn't negotiate backdoor service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| on behalf of its customers inside the city who would like to retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| or perhaps obtain for the first time the backdoor service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| It would seem to me if it's $6.39 to come to the front of the property at the curb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4325)|
| 1:12:13| to pick up household waste, if it's $8.09 for backdoor for elderly or disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| and I'm not either one yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| that $8.75 in addition to the $6.39 coming to over $15 is a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4346)|
| 1:12:37| given that we're city taxpayers, to pay to have the service retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| Again, I feel if you're going to get an enhanced service as a homeowner, as a taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| we should pay the extra for the enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| I have no problem with that, but I have a problem with being put in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| where I have to negotiate with only one waste hauler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| unlike perhaps other individuals outside the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| because the city has already set a contract to my property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| but not up my driveway, and then it becomes my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| I happen to have a long, steep, narrow, gravel driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| and it's hard to roll carts up and down that driveway, I can assure you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| I also happen to travel once in a while, and I don't want my cans sitting out on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4404)|
| 1:13:31| or not sitting out when they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| You attract thieves and put up a sign advertising that you're not in that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| So there's a lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Mr. Grieve, Councilman Grieve, brings up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| It's not just the safety along Kingston Pike and Tazewell Pike and other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4424)|
| 1:13:51| of the garbage workers, sanitation workers, picking up the full carts and dealing with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4431)|
| 1:14:01| It's also when you have employed people who live in these homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| and you now have an empty cart with 60-mile-an-hour traffic whizzing by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| and winds that sometimes kick up, and you end up with carts blowing into the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| I mean, that's the safety issue in addition to the general safety of picking up what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| All residential streets are not slow little places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| So these are the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| We're put in a position where we have to negotiate when you've already negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| and our hands are half-tied, and we're going to have to pay whatever they want to charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| and that's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4480)|
| 1:14:50| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Could Mr. Brace indicate whether for part of this contract term the city could add a clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4491)|
| 1:14:59| that sets the rate or makes it clear what these homeowners will pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| Is there any reason not to do that for the first year or some other period where at least the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| is not as rough in terms of folks who are paying not only their taxpayer $6.39 for the truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4509)|
| 1:15:17| to go by their driveway, but the additional $8.75 to go up to the back door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| Yes, and I guess, you know, hindsight is always 20-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| You know, this has been a moving target for four and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| So what we crafted I feel like is in the best interest of the city and really the customers long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4533)|
| 1:15:42| So I think for us to do that, and I don't know if Mr. Martin or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| I don't know if Boyce is still here, the purchasing, that wasn't in the original proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| I think we would probably bounce back to square one and have to get that back out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| That wasn't in the proposal, and that would probably change the approach people use to propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| or to submit a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| So, you know, point well taken, but at the time we wanted to get out of the extra back door service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4565)|
| 1:16:14| It was uncommon for municipalities to be in that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| It's typically provided by the contractor, and let's say municipality chooses to do everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| So, but I hear what Ms. Malone, and I really appreciate she's got significantly more experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| and wisdom in the city than I do, and that's some great point about being in that position with a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| But I think for us to do that, we probably have to go out and start over our competitive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| But I'm shooting from the hip a little bit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| I'll let Mr. Martin or if Mr. Evans is still here comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4603)|
| 1:16:50| I think Mr. Brace is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| And I think David made a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4613)|
| 1:17:01| This is, as you can tell, there are, what, five agenda items and then plus one in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4621)|
| 1:17:08| So this is not a simple matter, and it's not a matter that we have come to quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| We have worked on this for months on end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| We've had lots of people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| We have tried to weigh the needs of the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| We've had to look at the fairness of the service that we were providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| And we also had the desire on the part of the city administration to provide curbside recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4653)|
| 1:17:41| and how could we do that and do that efficiently and in an affordable way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| so that the city could provide that service to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| As David pointed out, the backdoor service is a rarity when it comes to municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4671)|
| 1:18:00| And it's an exception rather than the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| Taking the garbage down to the curbside is not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| It's done in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| It's done in lots of municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Those cities have streets that have people driving up in lots of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| all of those sort of things that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| So that is not something that is unusual at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| And so while we may be able to sit here and look at what is a comprehensive and complex plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4707)|
| 1:18:37| and find ways that you could tweak it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| we did the best job that we knew how to do in crafting together a good plan that answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4719)|
| 1:18:46| if not all, certainly in our mind, the bulk of the questions where it came to what was good for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4726)|
| 1:18:54| what was affordable for our community, what was good for our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| and what was affordable for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| And so we, without any hesitation, recommend all of this to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4741)|
| 1:19:09| and I think in the long run it will prove to be a very good thing that we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| and a good service for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| But to change that in the contract would send us back into discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| and if it was not in the RFP, then that could be a material change and would have us go back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4763)|
| 1:19:34| And there is a lot to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| I hope you have an appreciation for this, that there is a lot to be done to get this ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| so that we can start the service come October of this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4781)|
| 1:19:48| So that's why it's so important that we get this approved tonight and be able to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| Thank you, Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| We could cut through this real simply by if Mr. McGill will say that he'll use that rate for a year or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| McGill, can you commit on behalf of your company to do this for the first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| so that we don't have this consternation over what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| Steve LaFolla, I'm the division vice president for waste connections and live at 11144 Hardin Valley here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| We will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| You know, we're not using this as a mechanism to make money for waste connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| We're trying to do something that's very fair and equitable for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| We will hold that price firm through the price mechanism with the CPI for the annual contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Anniversary day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| And, you know, right now we pick up 45,500 homes curbside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4834)|
| 1:20:43| So we run Keekston Pike right now curbside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| We run, you know, every street in the city right now curbside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| So we do perform the back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| But our trucks are currently at the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| And we're very serious about the safety of the citizens of Knoxville as well as our own people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| And we will continue to do that even through this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| And we're very sensitive to those changes also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| I'm ready to vote, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| Now we've just got eight other people to worry about, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| Well, we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Well, ayes have it and so are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| 11-0 is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement between the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| and the Rockton Converting Company for the processing and marketing of recyclable materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| collected through household single stream recycling and city drop-off center recycling containers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| for an estimated annual income to the city of $42,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| So are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| 12-A is an ordinance approving the Knoxville-Knox County Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| as amended October 2010, which amends the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| I think we have some folks signed up to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| First person I have is Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4941)|
| 1:22:39| My name is Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| I live at 3029 Davenport Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| The South Knoxville Neighborhood and Business Coalition has discussed the proposed Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| and Ridgetop Protection Plan at some length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| The coalition consists of member neighborhoods, Colonial Village, Allen Home Park, Lake Forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4973)|
| 1:23:00| Old Sevier, South Haven, Southside Riverfront, and South Woodlawn, as well as the Downtown South Business Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4980)|
| 1:23:09| We voted unanimously to request your support for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| I want to thank the Joint City and County Task Force and the MPC staff for working so diligently to create a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| that preserves the natural beauty of East Tennessee and reduces erosion, flooding, and harmful water quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5003)|
| 1:23:31| while allowing for responsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| The plan was approved by MPC in an 11-2 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| Given the attention that has been given to property rights in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| we remind you of the very important group of property owners who also have rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| those who live downstream of steep slopes and poorly developed land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| Large-scale clearing of steep hillsides almost inevitably harm downhill landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5038)|
| 1:24:06| by causing excessive erosion, polluting streams, and increasing flooding risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| One part of the plan that we were particularly happy with was the incentives to developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5053)|
| 1:24:20| These include density bonuses for putting steep hillsides into conservation easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5060)|
| 1:24:28| and the right to build narrow roads and use shorter setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| both of which reduce infrastructure costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| Providing incentives for quality development is an excellent policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| The Hillside and Ridge Start Protection Plan is not about preventing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| Instead, the plan seeks a sustainable middle ground by allowing responsible development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| while reducing impacts on our natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| Please vote to approve the plan as presented. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| Thank you, Mr. Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| I see that Commissioner Hammond, the Chairman, are you here to speak on that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| Why don't you come down and tell us, give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, Members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| My name is Mike Hammond, 8103 Birchall Lane, Knoxville 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| I'm here at the request of the Knox County Commission to address you on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| and I appreciate the opportunity of doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| Like you, we have spent a lot of time on this issue as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| We've spent many hours in public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| We've spent hours in delving into the documents, both in session and out of session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| And the first thing I would like to say is that we owe a great deal of gratitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| to my colleague, Tony Norman, and to Joe Hulquist and the members of this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| for the amount of time that they spent in developing this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| They've worked hard, and they have presented what we feel was a basically good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| I have some empathy for them in that before I became a member of county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| I was a member of a task force that was charged with looking at efficiencies in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| We spent a year and a half doing work, and we submitted our plan to the commission and to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| and we felt that it was a very good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| We thought it was well documented, that it was well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| We had held hearings, we had talked with a number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| and when we presented our document, we felt that it all should be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| and that it was in such a way that there would be no way that they could look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| this is not a good document, and we disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| But we found that that was not the case, that as it was presented to the mayor and commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| they had their ideas, and they had some improvements that they wanted to make to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| And so I have empathy for those who have spent the three years in this and have presented the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| and that there are those of us who have looked at it and said perhaps some of these points need further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| What we as commission are suggesting to you, and we were unanimous in asking that we come and present this to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5221)|
| 1:27:09| is an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| As it stands now, when we had our commission meeting, we were presented with three proposals on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| Number one, postpone it. Number two, vote it up. Number three, vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| Those were our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| We could not amend the plan according to our law director and according to Mr. Donaldson, the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| Those were our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| If we wanted to take a look at various parts of the plan, we had to vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| Or we could vote it and approve it and send it on to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| By a vote of six to five, our body voted against the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| Not because we didn't feel that parts of it had merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| but because there were some parts of that plan that we felt needed further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| So I'm here this evening to say to you that we would like to propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| if this body would feel that it would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| that perhaps we have a joint meeting of the county commission and the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| to address some of those issues and then perhaps form a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| to take a look at this and see if there is ways that we could look at these defined areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| to see if there are opportunities for further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| As it stands now, this proposal has been voted down by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| As it stands now, it could either go no further or we can take a look at further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| It is our belief that we need to look at it for further review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| but we are here to say that if it would be of interest to you and if it would be beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| that perhaps our two bodies have some type of meeting so that we might do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| We would suggest that we define those areas where there might be some further review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| that there be a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| We haven't thought all of this through, so I don't have all of the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Perhaps if you chose to have this joint meeting with the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| that we might, maybe Mr. Bailey and I could get together and present to the both bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| a framework of how this committee might work, who would be involved in the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| We feel it important that everybody be brought to the table to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| So again, I appreciate the opportunity of being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| Again, I'm here at the request of the commission to present this idea to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| We know that you will take the action that you feel appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| but if you feel that this would be appropriate, then we'd be very willing to move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| Mr. Strickland, he said he didn't really understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| and I didn't understand either, the process for speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| so he asked me if I would ask if it would be appropriate for him to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| and so I just make that at his request, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| I see him out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| We have several people who have signed up to speak, and I see two other commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5381)|
| 1:29:50| I don't know if they wanted to speak or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| Commissioner Norman, did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| Thank you, Mr. Mayor and City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Of course, we did have a discussion yesterday of this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| Probably a slight variation from what Mr. Hammond said would be that certainly I welcome a discussion of the topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5412)|
| 1:30:22| with City Council, among us legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5422)|
| 1:30:29| I think where I probably disagree is, of course, I feel like our process, the people that were involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5429)|
| 1:30:37| the process that we went through was absolutely thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| I do not see the benefit in forming a new committee to review what we've already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| I think that given what we have in front of us in terms of a plan, I think certainly the bodies could get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5447)|
| 1:30:57| and if there are items, individual items that are sticky points to us, we should be able to work those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| So I hope that you all will go ahead and approve this plan tonight, and we can work on those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| those individual things, I think, and let this process go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| And that's what's going to benefit this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| I thoroughly believe that, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| There's one other commissioner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| I don't know if you wanted to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| So I want to be fair to our, be courteous to our commissioners who are here and take the time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5491)|
| 1:31:39| You could introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| I'm Commissioner Jeff Womby, and I apologize for my dress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| I live at 7113 Rockingham Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| You've got a big on, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Yeah, well, blue jeans, I don't want to disrespect anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| Didn't plan on speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| I concur with the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| We did agree that we should, that it would be a good idea to get the two bodies together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| because there is sticking points on this plan, not just with us as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| but the citizens in the public that do not disagree with certain aspects of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| Not any plan is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| And we are not, I agree that there should be a joint task force, a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5538)|
| 1:32:26| but it needs to be a timetable, not something that lasts another three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| not something that lasts another six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| We need to look at it, and the only way, what we were told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| the only way you can make any changes to the current plan is it has to be voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| And I would urge this body as a citizen that it be voted down, but that's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5562)|
| 1:32:52| But at least, if anything, table it for later discussions that we may work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| so that the city and the county are on the same footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| and the same for the citizens know that both bodies are speaking with the same voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| We have several more people who have signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5591)|
| 1:33:18| Councilman Pavley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| Well, I would just like to throw out, I mean, we discussed this at our sunshine dinner at the first of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5599)|
| 1:33:27| and from what I heard from Commissioner Chairman Hammond, that's exactly, I thought, the way that this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| that we wanted to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| So I don't care at all to listen to all the speakers, but I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5617)|
| 1:33:45| I don't know if other members of council wanted to weigh in as to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| is that the way we want to continue down this path, or what's the proper protocol here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| Let me recognize Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Well, my view was, as we have discussed, and we've had two workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| and we've had council dinner discussions, that we would go ahead and bring the item forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5643)|
| 1:34:10| have a discussion, which I felt like we have speakers who have come tonight, driven here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| and waited through this council meeting, that it would be appropriate that we hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| And then I feel like that it's the will of the sense of the council that we would have a joint workshop with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5661)|
| 1:34:29| as Mr. Hammond recommended, and have a discussion on points where we might be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5669)|
| 1:34:36| or have points of interest or, you know, call it a compromise, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| But I think it is important that we have the discussion, we hear from the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| and then we're going to have to decide whether we want to postpone it, we want to table it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| we want to have an up or down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| So I think it's only fair, we've had three years' worth of work on this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| that they deserve an up or down vote, a postponement, a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| I do think it's my, this council member's opinion that we hear the speakers and we enter into a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| and we move towards some sort of a conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| Well, we can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| I don't think we have to vote on hearing the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| But let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| You know, Mr. Pablos brought up a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| If council would like to make it as some type of decision now, make a motion, then that's their, you know, your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5729)|
| 1:35:40| Well, I think we have to, excuse me, let me recognize Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| I would prefer that we hear the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| We've had a lot of people or several people to sign up who are deeply interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| I think they have something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Surely I would like to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| And then after we hear from everybody, then we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| I agree with Councilman Thomas and Councilman Bailey that these folks came and should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5766)|
| 1:36:15| We have four people who have signed up to speak in favor of the item that's on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5775)|
| 1:36:22| and two people, I think, who have signed up to speak opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| As you know, your rules allow for three for each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| Four would be one too many unless you suspend the rules and permit four people to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| Well, Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| In favor of suspending the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| Let's hear the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| And moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| So all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| And the next speaker will be Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5812)|
| 1:37:05| You give your name and address and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| I won't need five minutes, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| My name is Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| I resign at 104 Crawford Street, 37918, and I am here to represent Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5834)|
| 1:37:25| You should have in your packet a letter from Chairman of Fountain City Town Hall, Ken Cloninger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| in support for the approval of the hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5853)|
| 1:37:40| We ask that you vote to approve the ordinance in its present form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| We are all aware of the long and diligent work of the joint city-county task force on ridge, slope, and hillside development and protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5866)|
| 1:37:57| This three-year process was supported by staff of the Knoxville-Knox County MPCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5877)|
| 1:38:04| and included a number of workshops and meetings for public participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| In Fountain City, we watched a number of years ago the construction of an apartment complex on the hillside above what is now 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5892)|
| 1:38:25| We also watched part of that construction slide down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| So we are very anxious for the proper guidelines where hillsides and ridgetops are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5912)|
| 1:38:43| If we don't come up with guidelines to protect our God-given natural beauty, then shame on all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5923)|
| 1:38:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| David Vandergriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| Vandergriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| I'm speaking tonight on behalf of the City Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| Could you give your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Oh, David Vandergriff, 4005 Cletus Way, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| And I'm speaking as Chair of the Knoxville Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| The Tree Board supports the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| We've thoroughly discussed it over the period of time whenever the plan was developed at every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| The vote of support was unanimous amongst the Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| We feel like the plan is based on sound science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5969)|
| 1:39:35| Many of us are professionals that serve on the Tree Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| and we all know the risk of development of steep slopes in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5978)|
| 1:39:47| according to data that was shared with us from the Natural Resources Conservation Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| Our soils that are upslope soils are classified as high slippage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| That means if they're disturbed, they have a tendency to fail and slide down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| So, limiting development as slope increases is certainly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| It's important to preserve the tree canopy that we have on our hillsides and throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6009)|
| 1:40:18| You all will be hearing some more detailed information about our tree canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| whenever the tree inventory information is presented to you here in a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| We've seen some preliminary data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| One striking thing in that data is that we have an alarming number of small number of large trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6032)|
| 1:40:43| and they do need to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| Construction activity certainly adversely impacts trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| It impacts the number of trees that fail in storms like we recently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| So we feel like this plan should be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| Robert Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| You give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| My name is Robert Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| I live in Farragut, 11504 Mountain View Road, zip code 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| I also live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| I've been a Knox County resident for about 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| I'm here on behalf of the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| Our club has, as I've told you in the last meeting, we have a number of members who live in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| We represent members in 18 other counties around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| But we like the plan as it's currently written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| That's not to say I'll diverge from my instructions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| but that's not to say it can't be improved by looking at some things that some people consider might need some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6118)|
| 1:42:06| I suggested last night to the county commission chairman that the county commission indicates they have some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6126)|
| 1:42:16| that they come forward with a set of written questions or concerns that they have, item by item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6136)|
| 1:42:27| and don't start to rewrite the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| This plan has been developed over a period of years by a lot of sincere, dedicated, hardworking elected officials and volunteers and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6151)|
| 1:42:40| It is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| Now, I say that with my background as ten years as county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| 27 years as planning commission member and chair out in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| The elements of this plan are very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| They'll protect the environment and the attractiveness and the livability of this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| and this county from here out if you adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| If you adopt it with changes, I suggest that you, both of your organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| contribute things that you are concerned with, specific things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| and just negotiate those things and stipulate the rest of it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| Don't start over again because it's just too much work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| A lot of people have put in, as I've said, a lot of time on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| and it could be passed in the form that it's in right now, and it would be totally workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6211)|
| 1:43:38| The staff over here has still got to, it's a policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| and they still have to convert that to ordinances for both city and county for implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| So there's another discussion period after you do this in what the content of the ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6230)|
| 1:43:57| So the word I'll leave you with is that we prefer that you pass the plan as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6237)|
| 1:44:06| If you do have a joint committee, and committees are never a bad idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| you get other thoughts in the item with people who haven't been involved in it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| then just negotiate the essentials that you're concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| and don't do any damage to the plan and move to a consensus plan that everybody can live with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6263)|
| 1:44:30| and it will be good for the county and the city and our area generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| So thank you very much for the period of time for allowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| I appreciate the opportunity to talk on this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| and letting me speak since I didn't get here in time to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| And members of the city council, I appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| Having been in this business for a long time, I know what you're giving to the community, even if some of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| So you all are doing a good service, and this is, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| one of the most important policy documents about planning and land use in Knox County that I've seen in 37 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6306)|
| 1:45:14| that I've been involved in this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| I think it deserves a lot of attention and it deserves to be passed essentially like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| Mr. Hill, I want to ask you about the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| I'm very familiar with the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| But how many members do you have here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| We have about 800 members in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| We have about 1,500 members in the surrounding counties, like 100 in Oak Ridge and 100 in Blount County and 800 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6335)|
| 1:45:44| And then we're down to maybe two in Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| And it's a large organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| And the farther you get away from the metropolitan area, the fewer members there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| But that doesn't mean that those folks are not interested in the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| They just don't have time to work on it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| My biggest problem in this area is getting volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| And if you're a member of the Sierra Club, then I welcome your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| I've got a lot you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| Next we have Mike Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| If you'd give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| Sir, thank you, Mr. Mayor and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| My name is Mike Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| I live at 1663 Mystic Street, and it's 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6387)|
| 1:46:34| I think most of you know that I'm a builder and a developer, and I primarily develop property that I then use in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6394)|
| 1:46:43| I don't sell lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| I build the houses, and my wife sells them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| Currently, I'm one of the few builder developers that primarily concentrates on city property that's not downtown property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6408)|
| 1:46:56| I have two developments underway, Weatherstone on Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| I have one on the corner of North Shore and Pellissippi that I'm doing the residential portion, the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| And I've been in the planning stages with Dave Hill for the south waterfront redevelopment for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6428)|
| 1:47:16| The properties that we do, two out of three of them would not meet these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6436)|
| 1:47:24| The Weatherstone LLC and the residential portion of North Shore Town Center fall within these guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| and would change what we could and couldn't do on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| Currently, at the rate we're going, we will produce annually at Weatherstone $625,000 in tax revenue, property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6454)|
| 1:47:44| If we finish the plan at North Shore Town Center the way it was set forth, I'd be over $1 million annually in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6464)|
| 1:47:53| The south waterfront development hasn't started yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| If it ever comes to fruition, the piece that I'm working on would create somewhere between a half a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| and three quarters of a million dollars annually in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| I feel that what I do for a living and what my peers here tonight do should be in partnership with the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6485)|
| 1:48:14| When we work, we create jobs, we create sales tax, and we create property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6494)|
| 1:48:21| Quite frankly, we do it pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| Just like anybody, we have days when it rains hard that things happen, but I'm a member of the Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6504)|
| 1:48:31| I've been past president twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| I'm currently the president of the state association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| The reason we do that is to get better at what we do, to learn better techniques at what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| Everybody makes mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| We're not perfect, but I can tell you the properties that we develop sell well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| The people that live there, you can knock on any door, they enjoy their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| It would be a travesty to take that off the tax rolls in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| You know, my good friend Earl Sharp, and I've quoted him every time I've ever been here, says government can do three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6538)|
| 1:49:05| We can decrease our services, we can raise our taxes, or increase our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| That's what my job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| We increase the tax base with quality development, and we're proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| The problem with these guidelines as I see it right now is it will slow development in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| by taking property off the table that can never be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| It changes the way we clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| It changes the way that we have to grade property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| That's probably a bigger issue than the 15% slope or some of the guidelines that are buried deep within this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6573)|
| 1:49:41| It will hurt the county, but I can tell you as someone that primarily develops in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| it will stop development in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| I already have a problem, a perception problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| When I build a house, my buyers have to pay double taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| They pay city taxes and county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| They can go 100 yards down the road and buy in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| If more money is added to the development cost, I would not be able to operate in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6601)|
| 1:50:08| I'd have to move out in the county in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| When the recession is over, when housing is back, every dollar is going to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| And I think double taxes will be an issue, but right now I can sell the idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| and it's more than an idea that you as the city provide services that are worth the extra taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| If the prices keep going up and up and up, I think that's going to be a harder sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| So I really appreciate what Chairman Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| I think this needs to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| Certainly as a developer and certainly the home builders support some type of guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| there's a lot of good points in this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| But as it is, there's too many things buried in there that are going to stop development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| We want to be good partners as builders, as developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| We'd like to be part of that process that Commissioner Hammond has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| I would urge you to send this back and let us be part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| May I ask Mr. Stephens a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Mr. Stephens, as you understand the plan, what in it is preventing your two projects from moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6672)|
| 1:51:21| My two projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| If I were a selfish man, I would be up here telling you this is the greatest project ever because I own 100 lots in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6682)|
| 1:51:28| and it will be the last 100 lots developed in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| So I'd have a monopoly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| They're already developed and it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| But future development, the costs are going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| I thought I heard you say there was something about the plan that was inhibiting your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| What I'm saying is the double taxes are a difficult sell right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| And if more layers are added for future development, I think that would definitely inhibit the feasibility of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6712)|
| 1:52:02| Before you leave, sir, you mentioned two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| You thought the plan had, what, restrictions or obstacles that were of concern to developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6725)|
| 1:52:12| and it was how we clear and how we grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| Those are the words you use or the topics you use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| Tell me what you mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| You want to clear more trees on each lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| You want to grade a different way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| Tell me what you mean by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| Thank you for asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Part of the plan and part of what we deal with in Tennessee is that we have different soil types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| So when I want to create roads, I need to remove topsoil and take clay and compact clay so I have a good base for the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6752)|
| 1:52:42| The way this plan is, that's going to be difficult to move soil from one side of the project to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6762)|
| 1:52:48| because it does affect the grading and it does affect the clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| So, no, we don't want to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| So it's the site prep costs that you think make the lots too expensive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| No, it's the site prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| It would prohibit moving around on the site and moving soils because there's a limit to grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| and a limit to clearing that I think would create problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| And I think back on the development I did at Weatherstone, we had to move a good deal of soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| but in the end, we had very good lots and very good houses and great views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| and, you know, took a great deal of care to make sure that we stabilized the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| But I wouldn't be able to do that under these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| Thank you. I just wanted to understand your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Okay. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| Thank you. I have a question also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| During the three years that this plan has been under development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| at what point did you raise these issues with the task force or MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6819)|
| 1:53:47| When I began to read the plan several months ago and it was given to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| and quite frankly, I would have served on this task force but wasn't asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| But during the public hearings and the time over the three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| you were not aware that this was taking place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| We were aware of the slopes but not the clearing and the grading guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| that came out at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| It's a fairly complex plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Yes, I know. I read it several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| Scott Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| You can give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| And I appreciate the time and energy you all put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| And I know the folks here appreciate what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| If you go back and look at the original resolution that you all passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| that created the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| I think you will find in that resolution that you all put together the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6887)|
| 1:54:55| force to put together a plan for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| Look at your original resolution passed by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| It doesn't say for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| It doesn't say specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| It says for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| And I think if you go back and look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| the reason I bring that up is this is a plan from the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| that has been purported to be a joint city-county effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| And only recently have we understood that you could split the baby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| and the city could pass something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| and the county could pass something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| Go back, Mr. Swanson, I would respectfully request you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| If you go back and look at the resolution which created the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| that resolution had to be adopted by both the city and the county in totality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| before the task force could be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| And then the task force was charged with creating a plan for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6948)|
| 1:55:56| not the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| And I agree with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| I appreciate him being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| And I agree with what was in the editorial paper today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| We've allowed extremists on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| And I would consider myself an extremist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| This is what I do for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| I build and develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| So I'm an extremist on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| We've allowed extremists on both sides to distort the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| We need to come back to common sense reality, look at what is good in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| look at what is bad in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| and come together cooperatively with the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| and find the good points and throw out the bad points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| so we can create a plan that we can all work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| which does not destroy the development opportunities for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=6996)|
| 1:56:41| or the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| And I appreciate what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| I appreciate the time you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| And I guess I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| Do you all fall under the same rules and guidelines that the county did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| Do you all have three, I guess, choices, either table, approve, or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7012)|
| 1:57:00| I think Vice Mayor Bailey identified their options very cogently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| They are vote it up, vote it down, postpone, or table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| The county has already voted the plan down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| For you all to be able to move forward in working cooperatively with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7037)|
| 1:57:27| in my opinion, you need to vote the plan down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Therefore, it can move forward back to MPC or to a committee to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| So if you table it or postpone it, that's your prerogative, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| But at some point, I think the plan, if we're going to have a cooperative effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| would have to be voted down by city council and then move forward jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| And, again, I appreciate you all's time and energy you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| And you all have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| Mr. Strickland, I'm going to go ahead and recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7075)|
| 1:58:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| I'm Michael Strickland from the Chamber of Commerce, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| I'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| I'm here tonight simply to sort of clarify things and get out in front of a single point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| This has been beat to death, I think, not only here but in the other esteemed commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| I wanted to get in front of the point that the chamber is behind ridgetop development restriction, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7103)|
| 1:58:32| We think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| We think it's a wonderful plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| We think this is something that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| Contrary to what has been bandied in the public recently, we are open for what we call compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7118)|
| 1:58:44| because we don't take a position against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| We think it's a wonderful plan, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| It's just that we feel it's a little far reaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| We feel that at this point in time there are a number of laws that need to be looked at and enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7133)|
| 1:59:00| We think this needs to have another pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| And one of the issues that, again, needs to be raised in the question so eloquently has been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| where was everybody before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| Like all other political things, a lot of people don't pay attention until it gets right down to the teeth-cutting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7152)|
| 1:59:20| And I think a great number of the citizens of Knox County and the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| paid little to no attention until about three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| There are 63,000 affected property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| At the very least, I think they will have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| And I think if we take another pass at this and those 63,000 people don't come to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| then I don't think that they would have much to complain about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7180)|
| 1:59:45| But at this point in time, I do think we've gotten everyone's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| We thank you for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| And the Chamber is behind this in a different fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| And we want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| And we're willing to roll our sleeves up and take part in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| And to say what the other gentleman said, it needs to be a short process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| I think we've all beat this to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7205)|
| 2:00:11| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| You know, I think we've heard some great debate over this at our two workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| and the time this has come up on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| And we did have a great debate at our Sunshine Dinner that Councilman Pavlis referred to recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| And we do have a number of choices in front of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| Our former Vice Mayor, Mark Brown, oftentimes used to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7232)|
| 2:00:37| there's more that unites us than divides us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| And I think bottom line with this plan, that's what I'm hearing from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| is that there are a lot of great things in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| But there is certainly disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| And I think it's difficult for an elected body like this to choose one side or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| when there is marked disagreement about how to handle this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| I really like the idea of being able to bring the county back to the table in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7259)|
| 2:01:05| They certainly, in their wisdom, made their choice in terms of voting the plan down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| But the opportunity, I think, to resurrect it in a joint conference committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| gives us the opportunity to look at those things that we are united on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| that we have consensus around, and then build on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| So I applaud Commissioner Chairman Hammond for taking the time to come tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| also Commissioner Norman for speaking to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| And I think the opportunity to move into a joint conference committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| to look at what unites us on this plan could be very, very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| As we know, we really do have four choices tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| And the choice to table this motion neither endorses it nor denies it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7300)|
| 2:01:47| but gives us the opportunity to set it aside for a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| to focus on those commonalities and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| So I don't want to stop debate among my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| but I plan to make a motion to table this item once we've had some good debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| Well, I was following what Ms. Roddy said until she said the word table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| That seems to me almost like killing it without doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| And I would prefer that we simply postpone it for 30 days or 40 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| or whatever time we think we need to meet with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| and try to work to a common resolution in one plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| But if we can't do that, I think as a city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| we should move forward and act on the information in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| in whatever fashion we want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| I don't want to see this thing sort of have a death by committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| I think we owe it to the public to confront the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| to tackle it, to roll up our sleeves and do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| And maybe I'm misinterpreting what tabling is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| but I'd rather see it postponed until we can have the meeting with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| and see if we can hammer it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| If we can, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| That's the best thing, I think, for all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| If we can't, I think we move ahead on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| And I'd like to see this thing have its life continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| I just would like to follow up my comments to my colleague, Mr. Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| I think the difference is obviously a postponement is to a date certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| And since we don't know yet how long this process might take, I do think we all agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| We want it to be as expeditious as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| The other piece that we've talked about a lot in our workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| is that neither body has the opportunity to amend this from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| And so postponing it still keeps in play the plan that's in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| whereas I think tabling allows us a little bit more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| in looking at the plan in a joint conference kind of situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| perhaps recommending some amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| sending that to MPC to endorse those amendments and moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| So I think the flexibility of tabling the motion is what appeals to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| I do agree that we want this to be done expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Well, I'll agree with Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| I think that it's appropriate to postpone it to a date certain that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| I think that it shows that sometimes tabling, to me, would give the appearance that we're killing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7454)|
| 2:04:20| And I don't want that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| I think that we should continue to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| I don't know why we couldn't postpone it for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| I mean, there's no reason that I would know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| And that gets us moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| It gets us on a time frame, not to, you know, that necessarily is in concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7473)|
| 2:04:39| But I think that it shows that there is very good intent to discuss this intelligently with our fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7479)|
| 2:04:49| or a committee that, however it is we tend to move, that we want to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| But I think having a date, I think, is important to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| We've certainly heard a number of interesting comments and changes in some things that have been said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7502)|
| 2:05:09| I'm a little bit concerned about either tabling or postponing and going into discussions with commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7509)|
| 2:05:16| because this body has not yet acted on the plan up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| So what are the sticking points that we might have or that they might have if we don't take a vote up or down on this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7521)|
| 2:05:33| And let's say that we take a vote and whatever happens, happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| At that point, I think it could be very reasonable that a joint group with a time certain, as Councilman Pavlis has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7538)|
| 2:05:48| be set up to try to address those sticky points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| But right now, I don't know what the sticky points are because this body has not acted and identified sticky points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7552)|
| 2:06:01| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| I wanted to ask the chairman if he would come back to the microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| and ask when we look at our options, what was the discussion that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| and how did you come to the decision to vote it up or down and it ended up a down vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7571)|
| 2:06:18| and what was the logic behind that because I agree that no matter how we act on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| it's going to have some negative connotation to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| And I'm wondering, I think there's some logic to voting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| If you vote for it, then you can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| If you vote it down, it can go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| And that's where it would be worked on or developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| And I see people shaking their heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| No, that's why I brought, if you could tell us, Chairman Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| I believe that Mr. Donaldson might be able to address this because we had relied on his advice when we did our vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7608)|
| 2:06:55| So rather than me going into the details, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| would you be prepared to tell them what you told us at our meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| I tried to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| State law in 2008 changed and in doing so changed from giving the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7626)|
| 2:07:14| sole authority to adopt plans to create a process by which the Planning Commission approves plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7634)|
| 2:07:22| and they are not made operative until the legislative body votes to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7642)|
| 2:07:29| So essentially you get put in a position of ratifying a plan that's been adopted or approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7649)|
| 2:07:36| In this case, the Planning Commission has adopted this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| You have in front of you the resolution that does so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| As the municipal legislative body, you have the authority to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7664)|
| 2:07:50| and make it operative for those policies and those mapped areas that are within your jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7670)|
| 2:07:59| If you wish not to make it operative, you can not vote, vote to deny it, postpone it, work on your own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7679)|
| 2:08:08| State law also created an opportunity for the legislative body to amend any plan on its own initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7688)|
| 2:08:17| So the position that the county is in is that they voted not to approve the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7697)|
| 2:08:25| as adopted by the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| and discussed the idea of initiating their own version of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| and from that the idea of a joint city and county committee to look at what has been characterized as sticky points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7713)|
| 2:08:42| to try to get some resolution on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7722)|
| 2:08:47| You're in that same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| It's very analogous to the recent East County Sector Plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| which was adopted by the Planning Commission, approved by the city for that portion which was in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7733)|
| 2:09:01| but not approved by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| They then turned around, instructed us to amend about six paragraphs in one map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7744)|
| 2:09:12| thereby initiating their own plan amendment, and that is now working its way through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| So this would be a very comparable process to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7757)|
| 2:09:24| Councilman Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| I think I understood what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| Did you say we could approve it and then come back and amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| Plans can always be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| You have the authority to initiate an amendment to the general plan at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7774)|
| 2:09:43| Can we do it before we approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| We could literally have two plans to be considered, a Planning Commission version and a legislative body version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7786)|
| 2:09:55| and you would at that point have to choose one, obviously, or choose not to do anything, as I see Mr. Swanson moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7795)|
| 2:10:04| You always have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| Mr. Swanson, what's the difference in tabling and postponing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| I know the most basic difference, but what's the flexibility that's available to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| Well, obviously when you postpone, you postpone to a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| You move to place the issue on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| Then for that issue to come back before this body, there would have to be a motion placed on the agenda to remove that item from the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7825)|
| 2:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| And so that would be the agenda item to vote either to bring it off of the table or not bring it off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| If you vote not to bring it off the table, it stays on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| If you vote to bring it off the table, then on the next agenda, then the item will appear again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| So it's a little more complex procedurally to bring back an item that's been placed on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7850)|
| 2:10:58| whereas something that's been postponed just comes back automatically based upon the term of the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7858)|
| 2:11:05| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Chairman Norman, are you still out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| May I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| I'm not chairman, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| Oh, chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| Oh, you're talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| Yeah, co-chair with Ms. Jo Hoples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7881)|
| 2:11:25| The kind of conversation that would happen in a joint meeting, do you feel like that happened in your task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7885)|
| 2:11:33| Did you have the point of view of the people standing behind you in your task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| Did you have these kind of conversations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| I thought our task force was very well represented by the development community, the building trades industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7902)|
| 2:11:50| Do you feel like they spoke up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| Well, there's some people that spoke up rather late, you might say, in reference to the editorial today in the Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7914)|
| 2:12:06| So Gary Norvell resigned from the task force with a voluminous letter, seven pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7926)|
| 2:12:13| and I think he probably spoke 20 words in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| So that type of participation was troublesome, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7937)|
| 2:12:22| But within the task force yourself, the public processes that I've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| it's always good to have people who disagree with me, to have them right in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7949)|
| 2:12:34| I thought we had quite a bit of creative disagreement in terms of both sides, both ends of the spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7954)|
| 2:12:43| We had disagreement in terms of this is not stringent enough, we need more protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7963)|
| 2:12:49| And then, of course, we had disagreement that this is too restrictive, it's going to lead to, as they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7969)|
| 2:12:57| a reduction in ability to build and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| So I thought it was productive, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| Are you thinking that if we tabled this and attempted a combined meeting that we would be replicating what you already did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7983)|
| 2:13:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| First of all, I want to commend the committee and the three years of hard work that went into this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| and I'm definitely supportive of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| However, one of the things that I looked at when I reviewed the plan is the realization that, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8008)|
| 2:13:35| the plan really affects the county more than the city in terms of the properties that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8015)|
| 2:13:42| And yet, at the same time, that affects us in the city because you surround us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| and these ridges that we look at, the ridges that are going to be developed, are definitely going to affect us in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8026)|
| 2:13:53| And what I would prefer to see, because there are certain areas within the plan that apparently county commission is concerned with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8033)|
| 2:14:02| developers are concerned with, that we have the opportunity to sit down at the table and look at what these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8042)|
| 2:14:10| I would prefer not to pass on the plan as a city because I would prefer to come to the table with a definite open mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8050)|
| 2:14:17| not to come to the table thinking, well, the city has already passed the plan, so, therefore, what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8057)|
| 2:14:23| I do think that we need to have a time limit placed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| I also like the idea that you, Commissioner, recommended that you and the Vice Mayor get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| and come to some terms on what these disagreements are so that when we as a legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| and I really think that it probably ought to be just the legislative body maybe, that's open for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| but that when we do come together, we can really discuss those points that are of concern that you folks have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| and I'm sure that probably some of my colleagues have some concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| But I really think that we need to look at this not as the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8097)|
| 2:15:04| This is something that's going to affect all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| And I think we ought to be much broader, that we need to look at it as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| I think we have an opportunity as a legislative body to really come together as a group, both the county commission and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8111)|
| 2:15:19| and to really review this and to come up with recommendations that maybe might change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8119)|
| 2:15:25| I'm interested, again, in terms of what Mr. Donaldson said, that we really, is this correct, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| that if this group got together and came up with some ideas that we could amend the plan and then send it back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8130)|
| 2:15:40| The process that's created by state law requires that a plan amendment initiated by the legislative body has to be sent to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8140)|
| 2:15:49| for their action, and they're given the opportunity to approve, not approve, or take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8149)|
| 2:15:56| Then it goes back to the legislative body, and you can ignore any action by the planning commission or adopt in accordance with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8156)|
| 2:16:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Well, I did notice in going through the plan that what some of the folks are saying in terms of the regulations that we have on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8168)|
| 2:16:17| that some of those regulations can be modified and corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| But, you know, I think it's time that we as a community, we as Knox County, as well as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| really take the bold steps and look at what we want the future of our city and our county to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8187)|
| 2:16:35| And I know we have some very good developers out there that are as concerned about the ridgetops and the hilltops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| and the slopes as much as any of us are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| But, again, you know, I know I get criticized for using the word vision all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| but I really think that we need to consider what it is that we want our area to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8207)|
| 2:16:54| and what we want it to look like 20 years from now, you know, for our children and our grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| And I really think that these are really bold steps that we're taking in this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| and I think that we really ought to look at it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| One of the things that I would ask is to all of you that are here, how many of you have really read this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| and really looked at what the material is that's in this and what these folks have put together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8232)|
| 2:17:18| You know, well, I see some hands back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| But I think, again, I think we have an opportunity to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| I would really like to see us postpone this with a date definite, whether it's September 1 or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8244)|
| 2:17:30| and would really like to see County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| and the City Council come together and take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| I see Joe Hoquist back there, and he's been taking notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| And I don't know if you signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| but I would certainly like to get your thoughts on this if you're willing to give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8265)|
| 2:17:53| Thank you, Councilman, Mayor, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| Joe Hoquist, 2240 Fisher Place, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8276)|
| 2:18:03| Tough decisions as they always are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| Councilman Grieve, I hear what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| and it sounds like you're moving in the direction of postponing for a time definite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8288)|
| 2:18:15| and maybe that's the way you need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| I would say, I would remind you that you can approve the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8297)|
| 2:18:22| and in doing so, make a clear statement that we're ready to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| You can say that to County Commission, say we're ready to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| but that doesn't mean we're not ready to amend it based on what this process develops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8311)|
| 2:18:37| and we're ready to come to the table and be part of a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| I would actually advocate for that, but I'm okay, you know, either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| I mean, it's your decision, obviously, as council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| I guess one of my biggest concerns is how do you define what the real issues are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8330)|
| 2:19:00| As Mr. Hill said, you know, take those issues that are not truly issues of contention off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8340)|
| 2:19:07| as quickly as possible and define what the real issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| and one of my concerns is not only did a lot of people wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8351)|
| 2:19:16| until this came to the legislative bodies before they engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| but we've seen a lot of information thrown out that seems to, it's like shifting sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8360)|
| 2:19:27| It changes over time, and certain allegations are made or concerns are expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8367)|
| 2:19:33| and then those kind of fade away and something else comes to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8373)|
| 2:19:38| So I think it's going to be really critical if there's a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| and I think there does need to be a process, and I think the people that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| I think one of the great things about what's happening now is it's fleshed out people that have concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| and, you know, they're not holding back anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| They're not sort of waiting behind the bushes or they're not under worst case scenario to ambush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| or best case scenario involved in their lives and their day-to-day lives and have other things to contend with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| and just now became aware of it or just in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| So I think it's good that whatever their motivations, whatever their circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8409)|
| 2:20:15| that they are coming forward now, and I think in some reasonable form of representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8415)|
| 2:20:21| they need to be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| I would say that it's really important, again, I would reiterate that it's very important in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| to try to define what the real issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| You know, the whole thing about 15% slope, if we've had that for two decades in the MPC's guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| and they've been literally written in and approved by the city council and county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| in every sector plan for roughly a decade, then that may or may not be the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8447)|
| 2:20:54| at least in terms of residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| But there are other issues that we haven't heard a lot about, but they're starting to come to the surface now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| grading and clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| I suspect that's probably one of the issues that's been driving this all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| Well, we need to put that out front and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| You know, let's don't talk about, let's don't have red hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| let's don't talk about things that aren't real issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| let's talk about what the real issues are and define those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| and get on with the business that this process is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| So I think that's critical, absolutely critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| The other thing I would say is if you create a joint city council, county commission, committee, task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| whatever you want to call it, I think it would do this task force that's been working for the last three years a disservice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8495)|
| 2:21:43| if it were not still engaged thoroughly and completely in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8503)|
| 2:21:49| I think if you say, okay, thanks, guys, you've thrown it over the wall, you can go home now, we're going to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8509)|
| 2:21:55| I think you're missing an opportunity, A, and B, I think it speaks something to the work of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8515)|
| 2:22:02| and to the members of the task force that may send the wrong message, whether it's intentional or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8522)|
| 2:22:08| So I would encourage you to find a way to continue to keep the task force engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| And the other thing I would say is in relation to all that, you keep hearing it's a good plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8533)|
| 2:22:19| there's some things that need changing, define what those suggested changes are, but preserve the integrity of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8539)|
| 2:22:28| And that's why I was saying in my mind it would actually be better to go ahead and pass it tonight and say, okay, we passed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8548)|
| 2:22:35| but we're ready to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| I don't think you're all, I'm hearing you're all probably not, the majority of you are not ready to do that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8558)|
| 2:22:43| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| But it's critical, I think, to preserve the integrity and the intent of the plan in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8564)|
| 2:22:51| So I would encourage council to proceed ahead on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| And, again, to honor three, pretty much three years of hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| The task force started, I don't remember exactly, May, June of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| But, again, city council and county commission passed those resolutions in March of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| So that's been over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| I'd be glad to answer questions at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| Over our last several meetings, I think I'm hearing that there's a consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| a majority of council members that would like to see this task, well, a joint city county meeting put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| to find ways that we could work together and potentially put together a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| So I might recommend at this point that we take a straw poll to see if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| And then we can figure out what sort of procedure we would like to take from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8621)|
| 2:23:47| Well, let me recognize Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| That suggestion is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| I was going to move to postpone for 60 days and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| But that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| If you want a straw poll, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Let me ask Mr. Swanson, is that a fair way to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| We've done that in the past, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| Your rule, you've done that typically in workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8643)|
| 2:24:07| Your rules really don't provide for a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| But if you want to amend your rules to do away with the rules while you take a straw poll, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8649)|
| 2:24:15| Or that way someone can make a motion, which maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| We have, we do have this ordinance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8658)|
| 2:24:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| Need to do something with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8664)|
| 2:24:25| I would like to move, Mr. Mayor, if I may, that we postpone this for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| and during that period not only discuss the means and methods of how to meet with these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| but have the meeting so that at the end of 60 days this council is in a position to know if it's ready to act or not act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8677)|
| 2:24:45| I think deadlines are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| I think things slip without deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| So I'd like to postpone it and have an intelligent discussion on whether it's clearing or grading or some other thing that's the obstacle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8689)|
| 2:24:57| Let me just point out that the second part of your motion is advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| The motion has to be, with respect to the ordinance that is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| it's either to approve it, to deny it, or to postpone or table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| When you postpone it, you do it for a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| When you postpone it, you do it for a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| I'll second Mr. Dellavopi's postponement for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8718)|
| 2:25:29| Mayor, I don't have anything to the question that's on the table, but I did have some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| If the body decides to postpone it, then I would be willing to meet with Mr. Hammond on a time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8737)|
| 2:25:44| to put together a city county joint meeting and we can decide how we'd like to proceed from that point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8744)|
| 2:25:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| Well, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8755)|
| 2:25:59| And, Ms. Palmer, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| I have several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| And I guess some of these go to Mr. Bailey, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| Are you suggesting that during this 60-day period that county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| and city council would need to look at the sticky issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| or would just figure out what they're going to do to address the sticky issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| Because it affects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| What I would recommend is that we put together a joint committee to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| as just about everyone has said, there are a lot of good things in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8791)|
| 2:26:36| and there are some things that some people do not like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| And like Councilman Hulk just said, there's, I think, a quick way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| We don't have to, like the new Sentinel said this morning, we don't have to start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| There's a plan there and we could immediately find out what we don't like about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| what we do like about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| But I would recommend that we put together a task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| that that would come out of the joint meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| I have a concern about the use of the term task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| We've had a task force that met for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| We'll call it a committee, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| Or a review group or something because I think we've moved beyond the task force stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| and we need to be looking at what the task force has done to decide what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| And I think if we call this joint group a task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| we'll never know which group that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8853)|
| 2:27:34| Yes, there's something that's still bugging me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| Is David Vandergriff still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| I want to ask a question about, you talked about your expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8860)|
| 2:27:45| The thing that, I may be in a little bit different position here because of representing the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8865)|
| 2:27:51| I don't know if I've got the most flooding, but we've certainly got our share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| and I think we've probably got the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| We're competing with you, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| Yeah, I see somebody raising their hand back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| So I want to hear what you have to say about, is 15 to 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8881)|
| 2:28:07| is it significant as far as preventing flooding, as far as density of housing and reforestation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8887)|
| 2:28:15| Or does it have to get up to higher levels before that has an impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8895)|
| 2:28:22| Certainly as slope increases, there's a couple of things that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| Water moves faster and it moves with more force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8906)|
| 2:28:32| And that's just a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| What really is significant in the clearing and developing part that's been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8916)|
| 2:28:42| is whenever you disturb soil, and particularly you do a lot of activity on soil and you compact it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| you don't have infiltration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| If you don't have infiltration, you have runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| And if the runoff is on a slope where it's going to move faster and harder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| then it's going to carry more sediments faster into the smaller waterways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| that go into the bigger waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| And, yes, that comes into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| So it's all important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| But the activity that takes place is critically important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| in talking about the stormwater management issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| Because, you know, in nature, water moves into a soil that's been undisturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8958)|
| 2:29:26| and has characteristics that allow infiltration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| Whenever we disturb it and we compact it, that doesn't happen anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| The amount of runoff goes up very significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| So that's why you see such an increase in flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| In your opinion, would the implementation of this plan help curb some of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| Yes, and I didn't say earlier in my comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| but I am one of the task force members that spent three years working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| I worked on the site design committee within the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=8995)|
| 2:30:00| with developers, and, yes, it would have a significant impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9000)|
| 2:30:07| We have, and I don't want to cut off any discussion, but we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9007)|
| 2:30:13| Let me go ahead and recognize Councilman Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| This does pertain to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| Vice Mayor Bailey, if I heard you correctly, you're going to organize a joint session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9019)|
| 2:30:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Not a committee, but a joint session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| So we will discuss the sticking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9030)|
| 2:30:34| And I think that the task force leadership should be there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9039)|
| 2:30:40| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| I just wanted to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| Councilman Della Vopi, would you mind restating your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| This is the first part only, although I think the second part is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| But the first part is I move that we postpone the consideration of the plan in front of us for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9051)|
| 2:30:58| or until the first meeting that comes up thereabouts, the actual date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9058)|
| 2:31:08| I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9068)|
| 2:31:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9069)|
| 2:31:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| And, of course, is to facilitate this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| It's been moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| Well, I think there is a consensus here to meet with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| I don't think there's any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| I think we all want to do that, as we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9088)|
| 2:31:35| But from what I understand, we can still do an up and down vote and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| It does bother me that there's a lack of clarity here about exactly what our position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| To be frank about it, my position is getting more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| I feel like to represent my particular district, that this plan is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| I know there's some bad parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| Well, I wouldn't say there's bad parts to it, but it may be disadvantageous to some people over the short haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9118)|
| 2:32:04| I'm not even sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| What bothers me is when we – one thing that bothers me is we may be – by not addressing this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9126)|
| 2:32:14| and implementing at least something very, very similar to it, this city is incurring lots of expense on flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9134)|
| 2:32:23| We're, in fact, shifting some costs from one place to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| We've already had to build this huge channel on First Creek that still may not even hold all the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9146)|
| 2:32:33| And I'm not as concerned as most, I think, just because of my particular district, that we are completely consistent with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9153)|
| 2:32:43| I think there's differences in housing density in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9163)|
| 2:32:49| There's differences in terrain in different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| It would be nice if we could be completely consistent with the county, and I hope we could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9172)|
| 2:32:59| But if the county chooses to have a more lax plan than we do, that's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9179)|
| 2:33:07| So, basically, I'm for an up-and-down vote with the understanding or the hope that no matter how that vote would go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9187)|
| 2:33:16| we would still meet with the county and continue to have a dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9196)|
| 2:33:23| and work out any particular things on the plan with nobody being completely intransigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| So that's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9211)|
| 2:33:32| Well, we're trying to get to vote on this motion, but Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| I would agree with Councilman Thomas's position that I think that we need to do an up-and-down vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9218)|
| 2:33:45| and then, regardless of the outcome of that vote, I think then proceed with the joint meeting with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9225)|
| 2:33:53| to see what we can do to, if we vote it down, what we need to do to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9233)|
| 2:34:00| If we vote it up, what we can do to reconcile the differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| Well, if we counsel, I mean, Mr. Swanson, the ordinance that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9244)|
| 2:34:15| You currently have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9257)|
| 2:34:18| Two folks have spoken in opposition to the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9258)|
| 2:34:22| Once you finish discussion about postponement, if the motion to postpone is voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9262)|
| 2:34:30| the next item would be to entertain the next motion, which would be either to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9270)|
| 2:34:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9275)|
| 2:34:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9276)|
| 2:34:37| Councilman Della Vopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9277)|
| 2:34:38| Very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9278)|
| 2:34:39| I think the problem with approving or disapproving now is, especially approving, is that I think we're in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9279)|
| 2:34:46| We have a plan that's set in motion, and we may be going to a table to change some part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9286)|
| 2:34:51| and I think we add confusion to the whole world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| If you've got a problem with it, I think we ought to shorten the time frame from 60 days to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9294)|
| 2:34:59| But I think, for example, voting in a plan and then changing it immediately just creates like running in circles and furring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9299)|
| 2:35:08| I think if we go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9311)|
| 2:35:12| I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9312)|
| 2:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| If we can possibly vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| It's been moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9328)|
| 2:35:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| It is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| 12B is an ordinance amending the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 13, Article 1, Sections 13-2, 3, 14, 15, 16 and 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9357)|
| 2:36:06| and adding a new section relating to recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| It's been moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| There's a technical point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| We've still got David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9379)|
| 2:36:20| It talks only about the 96-gallon carts, but he's buying 48-gallon carts, so I don't know why the regulation doesn't include that in the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9380)|
| 2:36:29| And secondly, I guess I'm concerned about how are we going to enforce a rule that says that you've got to pick up your garbage can by 9 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9389)|
| 2:36:38| I mean, who's going to be riding around policing that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9398)|
| 2:36:41| That one seems a little bit impractical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| But first, why did we leave out the 48-gallon units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| I guess I forgot to add it, but we'll need to go back and add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9410)|
| 2:36:51| So I'll work with law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9411)|
| 2:36:52| We'll probably have to come back and add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| But we're going to have about 148-gallon carts, and we'll need to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9414)|
| 2:36:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9418)|
| 2:36:59| But it's a simple fix, the blank and blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| The other part is how do we enforce something about pull your garbage can in by 9 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9422)|
| 2:37:06| What if you're sitting in a meeting here and it's 935 and you get home and your garbage can's still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| We already have that in the ordinance, and so we enforce that through neighborhood codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9431)|
| 2:37:16| That's typically egregious violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| It just stays at the street or in an improper location at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| So neighborhood codes enforces that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9442)|
| 2:37:24| It's a rarity, but it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9446)|
| 2:37:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9449)|
| 2:37:30| Are we going to postpone the fix or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| Or just add the language here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| We can just add to include 48 gallons in addition to the 96.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| It looks like the definition of what a wheeled residential recycling cart on the second page of the ordinance on the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9461)|
| 2:37:49| there could say is a 48 or 96 gallon, you know, just to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9469)|
| 2:37:55| This is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9475)|
| 2:37:56| We could go ahead and prove it on first reading and then make the change by the second reading and take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| Moving properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9487)|
| 2:38:08| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9490)|
| 2:38:11| 12C is an ordinance to amend Chapter 11, Article 1 of the Code of Ordinance of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9491)|
| 2:38:16| so as to adopt regulations regarding the use of fireworks within the municipal limits of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9496)|
| 2:38:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| And move to properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| Councilman Dela Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| I hate to talk about this one, but my only concern is I picture some little girl with a sparkler on her birthday cake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| and apparently they're violating the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| That seems like a crazy standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| Anything that has, what did it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| There was a definition there that had visible or audible effect by combustion, deflagration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9519)|
| 2:38:45| or detonation meets the definition of a firework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| I mean, we're going to screw up somebody's birthday party and take a 3-year-old girl to prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9528)|
| 2:38:53| I mean, that doesn't sound right to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| Is there some way we can moderate that so it's not so all-inclusive as to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9535)|
| 2:39:00| Mr. Fire Chief, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9540)|
| 2:39:03| That is, we developed this from several model ordinances, and that is the definition of the common fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9543)|
| 2:39:10| And it does include things like sparklers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9550)|
| 2:39:13| I don't know about the little things they put on top of the cakes, but it does include things like sparklers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9553)|
| 2:39:17| which the kids use, and firecrackers and bottle rockets and several things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| Well, I inquired a little bit about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| and I did learn that part of the enforcement requires that the officers see the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9567)|
| 2:39:33| So unless a parent or group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| Don't invite a police officer to your birthday party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| Right, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| And they have to be there to see the sparkler being lighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| So I think we're fairly safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| Could somebody explain what the origination, the necessity to act on this now is, where that came from, who originated it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9586)|
| 2:39:54| Yeah, that came from the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| We've had some people actually pushing it for, well, ever since I've been in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9596)|
| 2:40:02| The primary purpose is just to clear up the confusion about whether or not it's legal to shoot fireworks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9602)|
| 2:40:09| And in the past, we primarily relied on fire codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9609)|
| 2:40:13| Well, we adopted a new fire code back at the end of 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| It's not quite as clear as the former fire codes were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| So instead of depending on the fire code anymore, we're just going to depend on our own city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9620)|
| 2:40:25| This doesn't prohibit the professional display of fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| It's just someone in their backyard going out and buying the common fireworks and causing a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| That's what this is designed to prohibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| Are using fireworks illegal currently in the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9638)|
| 2:40:45| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| They had been until a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| The fire prevention code changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| And that's one of those where we adopted the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| The new code didn't include the same language, and it was something that we didn't realize at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| Well, you know, I know in the past we've, the city, and used public service announcements trying to talk about safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9661)|
| 2:41:09| and how to safely use fireworks and that kind of thing like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9669)|
