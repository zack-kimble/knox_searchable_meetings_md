| 0:02:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| One motion is good. So that would be moving 11A, is congratulating our Central High School team who is here with us, and 12D is the violins of hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=169)|

| 0:03:04| Any opposed? Those are moved up after the reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| Okay, now we're on anything else? We're now on consent items. 12E through G are 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=189)|

| 0:03:25| For the Mayor's report, first I want to welcome Will Roberts. Please stand, Will Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| He is a Boy Scout with Troop 141 from Ebenezer Methodist, and he is here for one of his badges, so we appreciate you and your dad coming to spend a little time with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=211)|
| 0:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| So this weekend, some big news besides the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| We're looking forward to the grand opening of the Change Center, which is a multi-purpose facility with a skating rink, climbing wall, video games, cafe, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=231)|
| 0:04:01| It's a new hub for recreation and jobs for young people, as well as mentoring and job skills training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| The events will kick off with the ribbon-cutting this Friday, December 21st at 3 p.m., and it will be open for tours until 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=248)|
| 0:04:17| Then on Saturday, December 22nd, you'll get to skate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., preschool and elementary school children are invited to skate with Chili Bear, the Ice Bears mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| And from 1 to 8 p.m., there is an all-ages skate party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| And then from 9 to midnight, it's time for the teenagers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| There will be a post-hockey afterparty, and it follows the Ice Bears hockey game that starts at 7.35 at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| I do believe there's a $5 charge for skating, but it won't be more than that, if anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=286)|
| 0:04:55| The grand opening weekend concludes on Sunday, December 23rd, with a 6 to 9 p.m. family skate night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| Everyone is invited to see and experience the Change Center throughout the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| which is located at 203 Harriet Tubman Street, right down the street from Vine Middle and right close to Harriet Tubman Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=307)|
| 0:05:15| So for more details, call 865-951-1567 or go to the website at changecenterknoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=315)|
| 0:05:26| A few quick reminders about city services during the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Our city offices will be closed on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| I'm sure that isn't a shock to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| There are a lot of changes, though, to various city services, like the cab buses and trolleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| household garbage and recycling centers, and the Goodwill Attendant and the Solid Waste Management Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| Some of those hours vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| So rather than me listing them all off and nobody being able to keep track of it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| please go to our city website at knoxvilletn.gov slash news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| And we put out a press release today that details all the closings and the schedule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| So knoxvilletn.gov slash news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| One thing, if you have a lot of household trash due to the holiday and that doesn't fit into your garbage cart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=371)|
| 0:06:20| you can properly bag it up and you can put it next to your garbage cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| Also, broken down cardboard can be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| Normally you can't do this, but for the week after Christmas you can do that and we will pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| Right, Chad Weth, our public service director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| And lastly, Christmas trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| If you have trees that are bare, you've taken all the ornaments and lights off of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| they can be placed at the curb for public service workers to collect during the ongoing leaf collection season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| Or you can also take Christmas trees to the Knox County Convenience Centers and they recycle them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| So either put them out with the leaves near where the leaves are or take them to one of the county convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=420)|
| 0:07:08| And if you have questions about any of this, you can also call 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| So remember that Christmas and the city events such as musical performances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| elf on the shelf hunts, market square ice skating and more, they're all still going on downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| And on New Year's Eve on Market Square, we will have our annual New Year's Eve celebration presented by Lloyd's Electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| and it features the, how do you say this, Bicho brothers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| Anybody know? B-I-C-H-O?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| I'm sure they're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| I just have not had the pleasure of hearing them before, but I'll look forward to it on New Year's Eve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| So they will perform beginning at 10 p.m. followed by a countdown, ball drop and fireworks at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| And you can watch live coverage on WATE Channel 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| It's always a big time on Market Square on New Year's Eve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| And remember that our next council meeting will not be on January 1st on New Year's Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| which is when it would have fallen on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| So council has voted to skip that meeting previously and we will next meet on January 15th, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=487)|
| 0:08:16| That will be our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| And finally, I want to ask our COO and Deputy to the Mayor, David Brace, to give us a short update on Fort Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| I think some council members have been asked what actually is going on there, so I want to ask David to give us a short update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| Thank you, Mayor, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| So Fort Kidd has been closed by the Public Building Authority really for two safety reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| One, the original retaining wall that holds up part of the play area is failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| It was built with wood timbers and those wood timbers are deteriorated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| And so part of it has been closed for several months while we did an engineering assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| And then we received notice about some damaged wooden play equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| It's very difficult to replace some of that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| And so it's closed temporarily until we can meet with Ms. Waters and other individuals that originally helped fundraise around Fort Kidd and that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=543)|
| 0:09:13| Dr. Lyons and I, members of the Public Building Authority, will meet with them in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| and start to look at how we deal with some of the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| The retaining wall alone is close to $900,000 to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| And so we'll need to look into what our best options are and what the interests are with the original fundraisers for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| So if there's ever any questions, we do the PBA website, the City Parks and Rec website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| We do obviously attempt to keep that up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Great. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Okay. Now, are there any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| Okay. If not, we'll go on to the two items we moved up on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| 11A is a resolution honoring and congratulating Central High School's football team upon the occasion of its recent state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=594)|
| 0:10:02| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| So we have the team here. Would you like to stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| And do you have a spokesperson who would like to come forward and say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Please come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=615)|
| 0:10:42| Good evening. My name is Bryson Rosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| I'm the head football coach at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| On behalf of Mr. Reynolds, our principal, and J.D. Lambert, our athletic director, and all the teachers and parents and student athletes and everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=652)|
| 0:11:02| I just want to say thank you for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| This is just a very small percentage of our young men that have helped us achieve this accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| I don't know if anybody knows, but it was the very first state championship in the school's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| The school's been open for, I believe, 112 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| So it's definitely a huge honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| These young men, they're just incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| I mean, I'm honored and humbled and blessed to be the head coach of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| But for whatever reason, they trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Their parents trust me with their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| We started off the season 0-2, lost to two really good teams in kind of heartbreak fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| But these guys kind of wanted to see their season end a different type of way, and we ended up winning 13 straight games, the last game being a state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=703)|
| 0:11:52| Obviously, we were supposed to play Saturday night, and the weather did not want us to play that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=712)|

| 0:12:17| Yes, they cause us a lot of headache and a lot of heartache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| But honestly, they deal with so much between the demands of their parents, of their teachers, their administrators, their coaches, from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| I mean, they face a lot of different pressures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| So for them to have this accomplishment and for them to be acknowledged in this way is very special, not just to them, but to myself, my staff, and just everybody that invested the time in these young men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=750)|

| 0:14:07| Council, we also have here with us tonight Rabbi Yossi Wilhelm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| We appreciate him being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| I've asked him to say a few words just about this Violins of Hope, which is a pretty amazing exhibit and series of events that we'll have soon here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=853)|
| 0:14:22| Thank you so much and congratulations to this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| They once asked a Jewish musician, why are there so many Jewish violinists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| And he looked at the violin, how small it was, and he said, it's one of the only instruments that you can grab and run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| And unfortunately, too many times we had to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| Violins of Hope is a collection of over 60 violins that were rescued, saved, restored from the Holocaust era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=887)|
| 0:14:57| Some were played during the Holocaust in ghettos, in concentration camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| The Nazis had symphonies so that when the Jews arrived to the death camps, they would think it's a symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| How bad can it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Some of those people who played, their lives were actually saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| When many of them, after the war, looked at the violin, they couldn't play it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| They couldn't look at it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| And many of them just stored it in their attic or in some drawer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| In the late 1990s, an older gentleman walked in to the workshop of Amnon Weinstein, a violinist, a violin builder in Tel Aviv, Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=930)|
| 0:15:43| And he had this shabby looking case, and when he opened it up, the violin looked very damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| And he says, what do you want to do with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| He said, I would like to have it for my grandson, who is four or five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| And he says, what was up with this violin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| And he said, I played this violin in Auschwitz right next to the crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| When he opened up the violin, Amnon says there was black powder in it from standing outside over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| And for months, he could not look at a violin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| But then he had the courage, and he decided that he's going to collect these violins that were silenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=976)|
| 0:16:24| or perhaps some of their musicians were silenced, and have them play again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| And Amnon says that there were times that these violins prayed for their people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| for the Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| And then they were praying songs of tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| And now it's about time that we turn these violins into violins of hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| We're fortunate enough, we're the seventh city to hold the entire exhibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| We're up there with Cleveland, California, Phoenix, and some other bigger cities that have had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1014)|
| 0:17:02| And we squeezed our way in, and we're going to have it next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| The exhibition is starting January 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| We're going to have a ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| And then there are going to be two performances that are going to be a collaboration of the Knoxville Symphony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| Clarence Brown Theater, and Haller and Hilton Hill, which will host these two beautiful special performances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| which will be not just the music, but also dramatic reading and acting of the stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| So it is a great honor for us to be able to bring, you know, we're a small school in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| but this is a great opportunity for us to bring something to the greater community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| And we're very thankful for all the help that we've been getting from Mayor O'Hara, from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| and from all other donors that made this thing possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1069)|

| 0:17:54| Thank you so much, Rabbi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1074)|

| 0:24:13| I've been a proponent for a number of years about having a plan for Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| and we have three tenants there on the property, the Muse and Golden Gloves and the Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| and I wondered just about those leases and when those will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| That will be part of this study and just talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1467)|

| 0:24:49| You were asking about the leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| What do we hope to get out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Ever since we came on to Council and were first asked to appropriate money for repairs at Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| it's been something we've talked about, what is our plan, a long-range plan for Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| Well, we're doing the study to determine what is the long-range plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| I mean, you've got farm, you've got agricultural buildings, you've got –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| I mean, what all will be considered and how – to what extent will that be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| and how does it – just really how comprehensive is this going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| We're looking at the entire almost 80 acres of that property, and that includes almost 12 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| That's the Jacob Building, which is the main exposition center in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| the barns, the midway, which includes a pavilion and a large restroom area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| There's another pavilion and a park over by the mews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| There's the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| We have an administration office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| So all of that is being looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| And we have the Kern Building, which is where Golden Gloves holds their facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| in addition to the Homer Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| So will you be evaluating those leases to see about if those are still viable for –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| I mean, is that part of this, to see if that's a viable part of Chilhowee Park as this moves forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| Well, we definitely want to take a look at all the partners that are involved with the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| so all the stakeholders will be part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| And whether those are – be viable – I mean, is this a vision casting for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| Is that your intention for the Chilhowee Park, to see what –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| do we hope to come out of it with a community vision and say this is our vision and we move it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Absolutely, because we're going to have a diverse group of stakeholders involved in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| We're going to look at – we're inviting – part of the plan is to invite community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| neighborhood groups, the different leaseholders, the chamber, council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| all sorts of different groups to come together to take a look at what is the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| what are our plans for this? What do we want to see this to become in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| There's no direction that we're providing for this. That's why we're doing the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| I think vision is one description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| I also think it's an analysis of the constraints of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| There are issues with the lake and flooding and stormwater, history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| So some of these are constraints, but what are the opportunities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| And so some of it is what could happen on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| There are existing partners, and what are those opportunities we could look at in the future for that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| So vision opportunities, future opportunities that could be looked at in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| I just hope you'll look big enough and broad enough and, you know, with a clean slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| I mean, because it seems to me that there's not as much interest in the agricultural piece of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| or it wouldn't continue to be used, but yet we have a lot of barns and, I mean, there are metal buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| I mean, there's a lot of stuff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| And I just hope you'll look at it broad enough, look at the ingress and egress of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| We have, you know, that seems to be the biggest challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| And, you know, I mean, it needs a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| And I think we need to think big enough and broad enough for it, not just what's been going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| So, I mean, I welcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| I hope it'll be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| I look forward to being a part of that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Good. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1692)|

| 0:28:15| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| I'd just like to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| What really got my attention in that packet was seeing that part of the process was they would be reaching out to stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| community groups, to get their input as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| It's been a long time coming that we needed to do something with Jehowee Park to take it to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| And so I'm very anxious to see what comes out of that visioning process and where we move to in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| One of the reasons CSO was selected was there were eight submissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| And CSO had the most extensive, most comprehensive community engagement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Chip, thanks for talking with me about this earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| You really did answer my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| I just maybe want to reiterate a little bit of what I'm hearing from some of my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| that this community engagement piece will be so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| It was really well articulated in the proposal and the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| One of the things we spoke about is just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| doing a strategic plan at the end of an administration is not ideal because there will be new leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| And so it's obviously something that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| I just think getting that community support will be so critical to making sure that the next administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| adopts the recommendations that come out of the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| So that's just my comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| This is not this administration's vision for Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| It's really what the community, what are the needs, how is it being used, what could it be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| This is not because I don't have a vision for it or we don't actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| We want to see what evolves from this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| And five of you, a majority of council, will continue on with the new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| So we want to deliver to you something that you and the new administration can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| and determine from the options and from what we've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| You can then determine the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1826)|

| 0:32:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Don, did you have a, and I think one of the great things about the development along Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| and doing the work there was that we saw pretty much immediate response from the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| to come back behind that, buy property, begin to develop new property along Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| Do you have any sense of movement and any sense of that on Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| Does anything come to mind that you see, and I don't know the specifics, but I'm sure you hear and learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| I'm just wondering what you're hearing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Don Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| That's around our travel morning and evening on my way to and from work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| and I can actually say that there has been some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| The KFC had closed, as you know, and that caused kind of a disturbance as well as when the Walgreens closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| along Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Both of those were vacant and abandoned buildings for a while, and now they are repurposing back in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| So just recently, I think within a couple weeks ago, there was a building on KFC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| We know that there's another building on the corner of Olive and Magnolia Avenue that Trotter Montgomery now has a real estate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| So we do see some momentum changing and repurposing of those vacant buildings that were once abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| So it's beginning to have its intended purpose, isn't it, to spur new development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| Absolutely, that's the intent, public investment to spur that kind of an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| It's beginning to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Seeds of that are beginning to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2030)|

| 0:33:52| Walman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2032)|

| 0:34:04| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2044)|

| 0:35:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| I see Mr. Dover out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Bill, give us an update on where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| I think we knew when we were here in October and we were amending a few other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| We talked about going ahead and getting an extension at that time and it didn't last long to get to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| We have to do an extension of the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| No, they've been, Mr. Dover can speak to it if he'd want, and Charles also is with him from Nashville, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| They've been proceeding as rapidly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| The problem, you know, subsequent to the last approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| but there have been changes needed to be made to the site having to do with platting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| and getting the parcels split in an appropriate way that mandate they're going through MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| and then there are periods they have to wait according to the MPC calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| and all of that has caused some hitches and delay beyond their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| They speak for themselves, but I believe they're quite anxious to get moving on this as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| You didn't know anybody could pull some strings to get that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| I'll have to talk to Mr. Brace about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| Do you think 90 days will be, is that going to be adequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| I believe so, and I would hate to have to come back for another extension on the two extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| but we think that's adequate right now, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Is that finished? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2189)|

| 0:38:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Okay, Council, we have five people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| We'll begin with those who signed up to speak in favor of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| and they are in this order, Janet Testerman, Lauren Bluestone, and then Keisha Townsend Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2324)|
| 0:38:53| So, Ms. Testerman, if you would please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| and if you'd keep an eye on the timer, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Janet Testerman, 423 Scenic Drive, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| Mayor O'Hara, Council members, I'm here tonight supporting a proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| to institute a community cat diversion program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| that will directly and significantly impact the overpopulation of free-roaming cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| Community cat diversion has been proven to be successful in hundreds of jurisdictions across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| and we are, in fact, the largest city in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| not practicing the only proven best practice of population control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| through our comprehensive program to include shelter-neuter-return, trap-neuter-return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| outreach, and conflict resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| This is not just about decreasing the intake of cats into the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| This is about solving a community issue through spay-neuter practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| and is the single best solution to both significantly reducing the overall population of free-roaming cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| and decreasing the impact on the ecosystem as well as the wildlife population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| The issue is not whether free-roaming cats can have negative impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| The issue is how we can lower their numbers and reduce whatever negative impacts there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| Over the last three years at Young-Williams, we took in 8,735 cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| Of that, only 381, or 4%, were reunited with an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| Of that 8735, 3,381 were euthanized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| That's 39%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| A trap-and-euthanize approach simply doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| Shelters have been practicing that for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| and a national Harris poll also revealed that more than 80% of community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| do not want community cats euthanized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| The rate of reproduction of cats is so significant that there will never be a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| at which, through a euthanasia method, the cat population will decrease but instead is shown to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| In just seven years, one unspayed female cat and her offspring can produce 420,000 kittens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| Given the birth rate of humans at 10,000 per day and cats and puppies at 70,000 per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| that's one human for every 45 cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| so there will never be enough homes for these animals unless we take strides in practicing sterilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| Would we love for all cat owners to keep their pets inside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| We educate and promote responsible pet ownership to adopters when they come to our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| Unfortunately, indoor-only cats is not a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| And an enormous number of community cats are not owned or are cared for by multiple people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| By returning these cats to their place of origin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| friendly neighborhood cats have a 70% to 100% chance of finding their way back home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| and being reunited with their owner or owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| While there hasn't been a reported cat case of rabies in Knox County since 1969,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| public health remains of utmost concern for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| As part of this program, all cats will be released back to their original habitat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| having been rabies vaccinated and dewormed, sending them back healthier than when they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| This will increase community immunity, decrease the number of community cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| and end the use of euthanasia for population control of cats in a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| A statement by the American Public Health Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| and its Veterinary Public Health Special Interest Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| which focuses on preventing the spread of zoonotic diseases from animals to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| such as rabies and taxoplasmosis, states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| we encourage communities to discuss, trap, neuter, vaccinate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| and return as a management practice to control community cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| and to adopt this practice where possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| The American Bar Association and International Association of City and County Managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| have also issued similar position statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Even trap and remove is completely ineffective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| as that's also been what shelters have practiced for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| We are expending resources and wasting taxpayer dollars by holding cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| treating them for shelter-related stress and illnesses like upper respiratory infections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| and ultimately euthanizing a number because they deteriorate in a confined environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| In fact, the cost of taxpayers every year to impound, shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| kill, and dispose of unwanted animals is about $2 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| Domesticated cats have been around for more than 10,000 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| and lived exclusively outdoors until the invention of cat litter in the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| Most cats inherently like being outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| so to perceive returning a cat to their outdoor habitat as an inhumane outcome simply isn't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| The community cats are well-loved by members of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| and if they are friendly, it is because they are closer to humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Alternatively, if a cat is unhealthy, too young,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| or is known to have lived outdoors its entire life, it is not eligible for the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| and it is for these cats that have nowhere else to go that we need to reserve space in the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| The goal of all of us here tonight is fewer cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| This responsible program has proven time and time again to be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| and decrease the population of cats across hundreds of communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Ma'am, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Counsel may ask you questions after everyone's finished giving their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Next is Lauren Bluestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2654)|
| 0:44:23| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| and if you could watch the timer, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| My name is Lauren Bluestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Address is 1526 Ripken Court, and that's in Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| I'm the director of Metro Animal Care and Control in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| and I am here to kind of reiterate what was just told to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| There are a lot of conflicting sides when it comes to this issue, a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| It not only spans from those that are in the shelter environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| who are seeing the cats that are brought in euthanized quite readily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| but also other organizations such as wildlife organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| The bottom line, and I am going to reiterate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| is that we are here for the same reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| Trap-neuter-release is a long-term method of population control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| We want to help the cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| We also want to help the wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| We are not looking to stand on opposition at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| We've thrown statistics such as over 2 billion birds die every year from feral cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2730)|
| 0:45:39| I'm not going to sit here and deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| I think that could be a valid statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| although the number one quoted study is taken over the course of three months in New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2746)|
| 0:45:54| in a very central geographic location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| I don't think it's fair to compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| I don't know if you guys have read the analysis of the United States versus Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Again, geographically, very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Climate, very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| So we can sit here and go back and forth as far as what statistics work, what don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| But bottom line is this is for population reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| Nashville has implemented this probably major over the past three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| The population of cats that are coming into the shelter, it's 50% of what it was, 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2791)|
| 0:46:39| We're working with organizations and creating these partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| where we have targeted zip codes that are decreased population coming into the shelter 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| It's not only going to save you guys money, but it will also save things like the wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| You will hear also that there are a lot of societies who are against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| such as the National Audubon Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| New York is head to head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| You have other areas, such as Portland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| where the head of the conservation department of Audubon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| partnershiped with the feral cats and the feral cat coalitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| They created a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| We're asking to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| They're asking for your support in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| Nashville, our council gave us the support to do it, and our euthanasia rate is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| Our save rate is now about 90%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| and that's a lot because we don't have these animals coming into our shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| because it is long-term population control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| So I'm just here to speak on behalf of what you guys are trying to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| and the good that it has brought Nashville, the cats, and other wildlife in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2882)|
| 0:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| Now we have Keisha Townsend-Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| If you'd watch the timer, you have up to five minutes, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| My name is Keisha Townsend-Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| My address is 5001 Angel Canyon Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| That's in Kanab, Utah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| It's Best Friends Animal Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| So good evening, Mayor O'Hara, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| As a representative of Best Friends Animal Society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| I am extremely proud to stand here tonight with the leadership of Young-Williams Animal Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| and the many advocates behind me in support of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| The ordinance that you have before you tonight is a common sense ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| In fact, we are so confident in the solutions that trap, neuter, and return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| referred to in the agenda, I believe, as community cat diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| We're so confident in the solutions that they'll offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| We've committed to investing in it with a substantial grant to Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| so that the community of the city of Knoxville can take advantage of this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| When programs like these come to communities like yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| it means that more funds can be allocated to other important needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| such as improvement of public schools, neighborhood infrastructure improvements, roads, and much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2968)|
| 0:49:36| Best Friends joins the many other organizations who offer financial support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| for the incredible life-saving work done by animal shelters such as Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| for the community's dogs and cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| But we know that these life-saving efforts can only be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| to the extent that trap, neuter, and return is successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| The three main takeaways from trap, neuter, return, I'll call it TNR for short, are these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| One, it is the only fiscally sound option for reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| and eventually eliminating the population of free-roaming cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| Two, it's the best option available for humanely reducing the outdoor cat population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| And three, it's a great choice for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| I am here tonight because Best Friends supports more TNR programs in various towns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| throughout the nation than any other organization in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| which were specifically designed to curtail outdoor cat population growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| For this reason, we know what works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Our extensive experience has shown that TNR programs are effective in protecting human health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| reducing shelter admissions and euthanasia rates, and reducing nuisance complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| And last but certainly not least, it saves taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| Just take Hillsborough County, Florida, where the endless cycle of catching, handling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| and disposing of cats cost $168 per animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| whereas vaccinating and sterilizing cats cost just $65 per cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| A number of TNR programs have not only demonstrated dramatic population reductions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| but in some cases colonies of free-roaming cats have been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| For these reasons, among a list of many others, it is supported by prominent organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| such as the National Animal Control Association and even the American Bar Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| Having said all that, we also know what doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Traditional, intensive catch-and-kill methods are not only expensive and tragic for all involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| but it's ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| It is estimated that the cost for this never-ending cycle can soar upwards of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| brace yourselves, $100,000 per square mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| These methods are also unpopular with the public, as was mentioned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| In one national survey, 72% of residents in a national survey supported TNR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| where only 18% favored impoundment and lethal injection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| In contrast, trap-neuter-return offers the benefits of reduced shelter intake of cats and kittens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| reduced shelter deaths of cats and kittens, reduced outdoor cat populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| reduced number of nuisance complaints, and vaccinations to boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Last but not least, everyday citizens have the opportunity to become part of the solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| leading to greater community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Now, I know some here are here today to mention their concern about birds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| and I'm not here to dismiss their concerns, but I am here to alleviate them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| because the good news is this issue is not a cat versus bird issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| To the contrary, our wild neighbors, including our bird neighbors, are near and dear to our hearts too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| We have wildlife caretakers on staff and bird rehabilitation experts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| This is why best practices in TNR envision and support the well-being of cats and birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3188)|
| 0:53:16| It is also why so many people who are just as passionate about birds as some of the folks in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| have come to accept that TNR is the only viable solution for achieving what we all want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| and that's the reduction of outdoor cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| Okay, now we have two people signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| The first is Marcy Souza and then Lisa Lynn Randazzo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| Ms. Souza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| Please state your name and address for the record and keep an eye on the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3229)|

| 0:53:53| Marcy Souza, 1211 Bowman Valley, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| Mayor O'Hara, members of council, thank you for letting me speak this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| My name is Dr. Marcy Souza, and I'm the Director of Veterinary Public Health at the UT College of Veterinary Medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| I have been a member of the city's Animal Control Board for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| and a member of the Knox County Board of Health for the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| I have significant concerns about the proposed policy change regarding community cats, also known as feral cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| and these concerns are backed by numerous peer-reviewed evidence-based scientific publications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| Trap-neuter release programs have been performed for decades with limited success in reducing feral cat populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| Reported successes have occurred when significant effort is focused on a specific colony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| and a high percentage of adoptions occur out of that colony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| From a study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| the authors state, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| The present study yielded mixed results regarding the success of large TNR programs in San Diego and Alachua counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| Our analysis indicated that any population-level effects were minimal, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| Studies have also found that leaving altered cats in the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| does not prevent the immigration of additional cats into a colony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| In another study, also published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| Levy et al. state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| immigration or abandonment of new cats may be a frequent event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| and free-roaming cats do not appear to have sufficient territorial activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| to prevent new arrivals from permanently joining colonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| These new arrivals could substantially limit the success of TNR, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| Supporting TNR is supporting irresponsible pet ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| by providing a fed colony for unwanted cats to be dumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| Additionally, why would we endorse unowned cats to roam freely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| while dog owners are fined for letting their dogs off-leash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| Should we also not release unowned, unadoptable dogs back into the landscape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| Non-native species are a problem throughout our country, both locally and nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| State and federal agencies actively encourage the removal of non-native species,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| such as feral swine and large constrictor snakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| due to their negative impacts on the ecosystem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Why do domestic cats, also a non-native species, receive special consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| The answer is obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Cats are intelligent, charismatic creatures that we are routinely kept as pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| And blanket euthanasia of cats is not a politically feasible option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| But community cats are not pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| Although valued by some members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| community cats can be a nuisance and health risk to both humans and other animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| Domestic cats, a non-native species, cause considerable wildlife destruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| A recent study from the Smithsonian Institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| estimates that outdoor cats kill 2.4 billion birds annually in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| This study did not attempt to estimate the numbers of small mammals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| amphibians, or reptiles that are also killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Another recent study fitted colony cats with small cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| and showed that some killed an average of six animals per night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| How many dead native wildlife are too many to justify the release of a non-native species?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| TNR completely dismisses the impact of outdoor cats on native wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| Cats also pose a threat to public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| The proposed policy states that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| community cat diversion programs promote public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| As a veterinarian that specialized in public health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| this statement is laughable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Cats are consistently the most common domestic animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| diagnosed with rabies in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| and they spread numerous parasites including hookworms, cat roundworms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| and toxoplasma that can infect humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| There is nothing on the CDC's website expressing support for TNR programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| However, there are many pages about the infectious diseases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| that can be spread from cats to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Uncontained cats do not respect property lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| and will certainly wander, trespass, kill wildlife, and spread disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| Taxpayer-supported release of a non-native species is irresponsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| and conflicts with Knoxville's certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| through the National Wildlife Federation Community Wildlife Habitat Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| As a member of the city's Animal Control Board for 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| I want to express my extreme disappointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| that this policy has been brought to you with zero input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| from the city's Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| In my opinion, the Animal Control Board should have input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| on any animal-related policies to ensure all stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| are represented and a one-side policy is not presented to you as a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| I ask that you send this policy to the city's Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| to be reviewed where additional stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| including wildlife veterinarians and biologists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| nature enthusiasts, and public health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| can be included in the development of a science-based holistic policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| The value of native wildlife and human health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| deserves to be part of the equation when designing a proposed solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| to the problem of outdoor cats in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Sousa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| And now, Mr. Andazzo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3494)|
| 0:58:24| Please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| and keep an eye on the timer, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| Hello. My name is Lynn Rondazzo, 1800 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| I'm a resident of the Park Ridge neighborhood just east of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| I've written to you all about some of my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| with the proposed trap-neuter-release amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| However, in person, I would like to expand further on these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| On the surface, trap-neuter-release sounds like a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| However, as Dr. Sousa has attested tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| it's not as simple as it seems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| and there is a greater need for a multifaceted strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| if we truly want to reduce the overpopulation of cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| To start off, let me address that my idea of a cat problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| might be a little bit different than your idea of a cat problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| You all live in different areas of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| I couldn't help but notice the people earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| One of them lives in Sequoia Hills, and then the rest don't live in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| So let me tell you a little bit about what it's like in Park Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| with the feral cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Our houses are on small lots, and we live very closely to our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| We have neighbors who, trying to be good people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| have decided to start leaving food out for the feral cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| It wasn't a big deal when there was just one or two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| However, it quickly spiraled out of control, drawing more and more cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| In the current animal ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| the city allows a person on one acre or less of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| to have up to five cats or dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| One of our neighbors was feeding over 10 cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| Two years in a row during the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| we had a litter of kittens in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| With the help of feline friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| we were able to have the cats around our house neutered and spayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| and that did put an end to the kitten population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| However, that was a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| It's not easy trapping cats, and this process took a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| One thing I question with this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| is if the city is prepared or has the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| to follow through with the TNR program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| to give it its best chance at success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| which typically calls for more than 90% of the cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| to be neutered in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| However, that aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| while we haven't had more kittens in over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| our neighbors' feeding of the cats is still drawing more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| It's essentially cat hoarding just without walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| Now, don't get me wrong. I do like cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| I just believe that they need to be indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| It's incredibly frustrating as a property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| that these cats limit my enjoyment of our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| They're destructive and invasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| We find cats in our house, in our cars, in our basement routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| Once while traveling 3,000 miles away from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| we found our hotel room smelled of cat urine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| Upon inspection, we found out that my husband's shoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| that were put outside our car for less than a minute were peed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| and that made all of our luggage smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| We had to buy new shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| Also, my family gardens produce year-round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| My 3-year-old loves to garden next to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| and play in the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Without fail, every day we uncover cat feces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| from feral cats in our garden beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| This is very concerning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| as cat feces are known to contain toxoplasma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| The Smithsonian Institution writes about this, saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| the parasite enters the brain and engages the prey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| and changes the behavior of prey animals like rats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| which can show a strange attraction to cat urine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| About 10% to 20% of Americans also harbor the parasite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| which can be absorbed through contact with litter boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Once believed to hang out harmlessly in the human brain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| some scientists now believe that toxoplasma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| may actively change the connections between our neurons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| shifting dopamine levels, altering personalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| and even triggering diseases like schizophrenia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| in genetically susceptible individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| While I know to wash my hands after exposure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| my toddler is often unaware what she's been playing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| If you all have been around a toddler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| you know they like to touch everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| when their hands are dirty, their face, mouth, nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Now I wish this issue was isolated to our garden beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| but weekly we find feces on our sidewalks and driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| As long as there is a cat colony next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| my yard is simply not a safe place for my children to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Currently, we have been able to have cats taken by animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| We have done this for a few problem cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| However, an issue I take with this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| is that community cats, cats that are neutered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| and then ear-chipped and then released back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| are exempt from the current animal ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| This means that I would have no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| to better our family's current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| TNR would just be shifting the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| from the shelter to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| I'd also like to talk about the quality of life feral cats have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| It's not a good life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| House cats live from 12 to 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| whereas feral cats live from 1 to 5 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| They're threatened by disease, weather, cars, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| PETA, I know they can be a little out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| but they're an organization that is concerned with the welfare of animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| and PETA is against TNR going as far as to call it trap, neuter, abandon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| There are a few things I'd like to suggest to deal with this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| I'm running out of time, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| but I would like to ask you to please do not take the popular position here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| but take the informed position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| Solutions to the overpopulation cannot come at the expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| of public health and our local ecosystems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| Okay, that's the end of the speaker's council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| I just wanted to say this is obviously a lot of people feel very heartfelt about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3828)|
| 1:03:56| and we all do want to see less abandoned cats, less homeless cats, less feral cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| Both my mother and my sister have nursed by bottle feral cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| that they found at different times and made them their pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| They rescued them as kittens, so I'm familiar with the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| and those being long-term pets in my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| I am not in favor of this ordinance as it's currently proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| and I did email Ms. Testerman that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| The opposition to it and the concerns about it are coming from people with biology backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3865)|
| 1:04:33| and an understanding of science and also with veterinary degrees and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3873)|
| 1:04:41| And that is what stands out to me as a former medical librarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| with a career in evidence-based medicine and practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| that when you look at the guidelines and you look at the position statements of the International Society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| of the AAFP and different things, it needs to be a multi-pronged approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| And I would agree with Dr. Sousa that it needs to go back to the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| And what I said to Ms. Testerman earlier, I'll just read what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| I said, while I am not opposed to TNR as part of a multi-pronged strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| TNR alone does not reduce feral cat populations according to professional practice guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| and peer-reviewed literature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| And I printed out some of those articles here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| That's what I do at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| I teach students how to look at articles and look at how a study is put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| and look at results and conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| Additionally, I talked at length to it simply shifts the burden from a shelter to neighborhoods and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| So we're basically saying we feel better because we're not euthanizing these animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| And we're saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| We're not euthanizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| But we're shifting the expense out somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| If you look at the articles and the peer-reviewed literature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| the articles and studies where it has been successful, like Newport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| which is considered to be, I think that happened in the 90s, early 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| where they were very successful, they were able to isolate the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| And we're not going to be able to build a wall and define the perimeters of Knoxville to feral cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| So you have to have a multi-pronged strategy where you can isolate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| where you have teams of colony caretakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| And until that strategy is presented and talked about how it's going to be funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| the education component of it, I want to see that and hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| I want to see and hear buy-in from the scientific community to understand the disease communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| and also understand how the reproduction happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| Because removing a cat, neutering it, and taking it back and vaccinating it once and not annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| which is what we ask of pet owners in the city of Knoxville, we ask them to vaccinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| And, in fact, we say we will fine you if you don't vaccinate your pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| So we're saying we're going to vaccinate these animals once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| and we have no means of capturing them again and continuing the inoculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| which creates the herd immunity, which is how vaccinations actually work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| The rest of my email is additionally I talked at length to several veterinarians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| including my own, who I have a longtime relationship with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| and respect his understanding and practice of veterinary medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| None of the veterinarians I spoke with support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| In fact, professionals are not in consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Many believe TNR conflicts ethically with the oath of practice they took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| Practice guidelines and the veterinarians I spoke with don't support TNR without a vaccination component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| and my vet specifically asked about routine continuing vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| It needs to be pronged with isolation, vaccination, and meeting extremely high rates of TNR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| The literature says that it has been successful where there have been strategies to get over 90% rates of TNR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4067)|
| 1:07:56| So unless we commit funds, resources, people, volunteers, teamwork with University of Tennessee Veterinary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| to actually infiltrate and make that 90% or better rate, we won't be reducing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| And that is what the literature says, that it's been some zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| And in fact, Athens-Clarke County funded $10,000 a year in their annual budget to fund and pay back folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| for catching and neutering and releasing, and they abandoned that a couple of years ago and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| well, we don't know that we made any impact, but we tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| So are we counting? Are we looking at the impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| Feral cats carry a host of zoonotic diseases. You've heard all about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| Right now, the veterinarian experts in their field say that we are an endemic area for rabies in the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4119)|
| 1:08:49| That's on the CDC website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| And rabies is on the rise in our raccoon populations, and our wildlife specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| and veterinarians are trying to figure out how to address that and combat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| Raccoons come and feed from foods put out for feral cats, so we're going to be attracting those rabid, potentially, raccoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4143)|
| 1:09:10| Those are going to interact with the cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| These are all things that I want input and some support from the experts in science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| and veterinary medicine to weigh in on before I feel comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| This is also a debate about how one defines humane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| That was the other common denominator in talking with veterinarians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| Some feel better and feel that humane is defined by not euthanizing and minimizing euthanasia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| But my veterinarian described to me having to remove limbs and remove eyeballs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| from feral cats that are out in the community that have been maimed and mauled and hit by cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| and then being asked to neuter those and put them back out as community cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| And that was a specific example where he felt like that conflicted with his oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| as well as, is that truly humane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| So it's how you define humane, and the issue at hand is the two different groups don't define it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| Many don't consider the life of community cats to be more humane than euthanasia, so that's a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| The science behind TNR is mixed at best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| and most scientific papers have shown little to no impact of TNR program on cat numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| Again, TNR by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| It has to be pronged with resources, and if you look at the guidelines from the various associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| that is what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| They say vaccinate, and they say provide sources and funds to educate, get people to neuter their pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| You can't just do TNR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| You have to do multiple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| And so I've suggested that there be a postponement or withdrawal to come back with a plan or proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| where it's multi-pronged and has buy-in from the science and veterinary community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| because I do respect their opinion and their input and their education where they understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Councilwoman Singh-Peretz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| Where I was living in New York area, this had been in practice for I don't know how long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| but it seemed to be very effective, and the worst-case scenarios that are being thrown around were never realized at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| I don't think there's anything natural or humane about catching cats, warehousing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| keeping them in cages until they're euthanized or die of being kept in a cage all their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| So there might be other aspects to this we need to work on, but I'm ready to move with this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| I agree with Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| I think we need to look at other opinions on the matter and not just go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| I think the Animal Control Board definitely should hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| All major ornithological organizations are not in support of this type of program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| and coming from a wildlife conservation background, I certainly cannot support this as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| So I think we need to hear more about it and give us some more time to look at the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| and what we really should do going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| I'm surprised the Animal Control Board wasn't asked their opinion on this, so I'm not going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| It's obvious that this issue is not one of agreement in the scientific community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| in the practice community, or the policy community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| There are very strong and well-documented reasons for the people who stand on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4340)|
| 1:12:28| So this is a really challenging issue, as many animal issues are that come before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| and I've followed them for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Animals are a particular interest of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| I actually just have some questions for Ms. Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| or there may be someone else who can answer these as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| Come on up, Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| Thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Can you talk a little bit about, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| one of the things that we're hearing is that the trap-neuter release by itself alone is not an effective practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4376)|
| 1:13:05| Could you talk a little bit about some of the other strategies that Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| and our animal control officers are already using to address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| Well, I think part of that is it is definitely multi-pronged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| I mean, it's not just a single trap-neuter release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| You know, we get these animals in from animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| We have Good Samaritans that are bringing these animals to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| thinking that that's the best option is to bring them to the shelter, when in fact, you know, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| I mean, spay-neuter is something that's pivotal and critical as part of this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| We know that spay-neuter works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| I mean, our intake 10 years ago was 18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| It's 10,000 today, and that's a testimony to spay-neuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| As part of, too, is some of the other issues or prongs around this, it is a comprehensive program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| and a lot of it is about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| A lot of it is about deterrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| I mean, part of this program is, for instance, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| if there's a nuisance call regarding a cat that's in a garden or in a yard that's something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| then we have deterrence that, as part of our pet resource center, that we have invested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| that community members can come and take for a week, for two weeks, that are, you know, humane deterrence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| but they also deter cats from, you know, doing some of the nuisance behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| But spay-neuter is also the deterrent because a lot of those behaviors, those nuisance calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| diminish greatly once these animals are spay-neutered and return to their habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4478)|
| 1:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Will these cats be immunized before they're returned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| There's a vaccination as part of this program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| I mean, it's the same with every animal that comes into the shelter now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| Every animal is vaccinated, it's dewormed, and it's spay-neutered before it goes out for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| But these cats would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| They would be vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Public health is of utmost concern for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| We want to continue the fact that, you know, we haven't had a rabid cat case in 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| but that said, that's a part of our vaccination program that we would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| So we're sending them back out healthier than they were when they came to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| and to the point of cats that might be, that might come in injured, that might come in sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| those cats are not eligible to go back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| At that point, those pets would be, or those animals would be treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| and looked for other outcome options other than return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| We're not going to send an unhealthy or an animal that's too young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| or that can't fend for itself back into the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| So our current practice is if, on a complaint basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| animal control would pick up a cat and bring it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| And what happened, our current practice, not under the proposed policy change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| Our current practice is that animal control picks up these cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| Sometimes they're responsible for trapping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| They bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| And then based on the behavior of the cat when they come in, then we're holding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| A lot of these cats are feral or unsocialized friendly, but some of them are community cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| They're friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| They've been around humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| They do have a food source, and it could be multiple food sources of people feeding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| We're not advocating, actually, people feeding colonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| I mean, that's not something that we're advocating on our end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| But there are those cats that are cared for by multiple people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| And so those are part of the population too that need to go back to those neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| to those people that care for them because they are socialized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| and they do have a greater chance of going back to that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| where people do care for them and are caring for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| Yeah, that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| I'll just say, Mayor, if it's okay with my light still on, that I support this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| I think that there is not agreement, unfortunately, in the public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| or the animal welfare communities about these types of policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| I think that I've followed our practices around animal welfare in Knoxville with great interest for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| and this is an issue that just has not been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| And so although I understand that there are concerns, this to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| and speaking with friends in the public health field as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| our current practice is not addressing the issue, and this shows promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4668)|
| 1:17:58| We've heard examples from Nashville and other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| Based on the research that I've done, which was not as extensive as Councilwoman Ryder's research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| what I'm seeing is that this is a promising practice that would be something that I would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you, Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| Thank you, and I want to thank everyone who came to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| and shared your opinions and your research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| I've never been a cat person, so it is really hard for me to sympathize with the plight of cats, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4708)|
| 1:18:37| But what I will tell you is that just what I've learned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| just from the research that I've heard about and that I've done specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| is that I am not an advocate for euthanizing large amounts of cats because they do not have a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4725)|
| 1:18:53| It is not necessarily that cat's issue that they were unwanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| or they were born into that particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| We've heard from two cities who have shared that this has been a step in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| in reducing these populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| However, we've also heard some additional concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| I feel that this is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| However, I do think that there needs to be some continued conversation and partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| once we move this forward and look at what some of the outcomes will be for us in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| I never really envisioned myself talking about spaying and neutering cats and vaccinating cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| but I realize it's a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| The information that I got over the last few days about this was very conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| This study was done in this city, and they had amazing results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| This study was done in another city, and they didn't have as good a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| It was very conflicted and all over the board and sent from both sides on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| I think it's a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| You've got to make a move, and if it doesn't work, then you can go to Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| I think it's either trap and neuter and release or trap and euthanize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4811)|
| 1:20:19| I think that, given that hard decision today, I'm not sure that we may end up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| If we find after a number of years of research it doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| then I think you go back and you can always tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| I think it's a move in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| It makes sense to me, and I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| I don't see somebody who hasn't talked yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| I think this is a difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4844)|
| 1:20:51| My household growing up, my mother loves cats, and she has cats now, so maybe I am a cat person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4851)|
| 1:21:00| But I don't have any cats currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| I guess the issue that I'm seeing is that what we're doing right now doesn't work, or it isn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4864)|
| 1:21:12| So this is an opportunity, and we've heard some discussion today about something that might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| I think more study is needed, and I would certainly support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| but I would have to agree that this seems like we're trying to move in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| I think everybody wants to have fewer feral cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| We don't want to have the impact on the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| and so I would say that this is a move in the right direction, so I'm supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| I want to make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| I would like to ask Dr. Souza and Janet Testerman, I believe you're both on Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Animal Control Board is our agency that hears about and sets our policy for how we decide to respond to nuisance calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4914)|
| 1:22:05| and all of our policies in our ordinance somehow are bounced off Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| Is that the intent and the purpose of the Animal Control Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Lawyers here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| Sorry, maybe I didn't phrase it correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| I'd like to, for the record, say I am not in favor of euthanizing any pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| I have had to put a pet down when he was at the very near end of, it just was a bad situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4946)|
| 1:22:34| and it was the worst thing ever, ever, period, ever, and I've done it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| I do not support warehousing animals and keeping them in cages and euthanizing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| but what the literature says, and when we look at different studies that say it was successful here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| and it wasn't successful there, it was successful there because they did TNR plus, plus, plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| and I'm saying we're not quite there yet, and versus passing ordinance and say two to three years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| the cat population isn't less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Its status quo slash or it's more come with more because what the bird folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| if we want to call them that, and the wildlife specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| that what they're saying is they're in favor of reducing the cat population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| That's what was presented to us is that everybody's in favor of less feral cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| I think we're just not quite there, and so what I would like to ask Dr. Sousa and Ms. Testerman is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| when is the next animal control board, if someone could let me know when that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5006)|
| 1:23:33| The middle of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| So if we did a, we do things by weeks for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| If we did a postponement, is this something that could go to the animal control board for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| to see if there's some addition, tweaking, additional concerns to make this more effective based on the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5026)|
| 1:23:55| that says it's effective when you do TNR plus other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| That's, I would like some buy-in from the biologists and the scientists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| and the medical professionals in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| That's my ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| I guess I'm making a motion for a postponement to, I don't know, count the weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| Eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| You're saying eight weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| Oh, who said that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| You did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Eight-week postponement is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| And if they need more time, you could come back at eight weeks and extend it further if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| Okay, so it's a substitute motion to postpone for eight weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| and ask the animal control board to review and make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| Okay, who wants to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Well, I just want to further say, I mean, again, Councilman Roberto said the magic word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| It might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| This proposed program might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| We don't have all the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| I mean, at this point, without concrete evidence and further study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| and something that we can look at that is not just debating cats and birds tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| that could go on all night, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| But, you know, for me right now, what this program possibly, again, might do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| is also put the well-being and welfare of a domestic animal over wildlife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| and natural species, native species that have been in decline for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5124)|
| 1:25:30| And so what we might be doing is exacerbating that problem and that reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| So, again, we could talk about this all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| I think just having a little more input would give us a little more insight and more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| And I think sending it to the control board is a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Vice Mayor Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| I'm not going to support this postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| I would like to go ahead and implement this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| and then talk about it at the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| I think this is a correct step, a correct step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| I think there probably are other steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| But I would like to go ahead and start this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| and I think the animal control board will certainly take this matter up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| obviously after this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| I see no more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Did we find the date of the animal control board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| Mid-January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Mid-January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Mid-January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Because our next meeting is January 15th, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| So is it before or after the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| Do we know if it's before or after the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| We're postponing it for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| Well, that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| But if it fails, you know, there's still a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| So I'm just trying to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| are we going to be voting on this a second time before the animal control board looks at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| And in terms of, you know, I agree with a lot of what's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| It's a difficult issue and you hear, you know, there's different reports cited for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| I was sort of inclined, you know, like Councilmembers Wallace and Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| that what we're doing is not working, so let's try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| And I was going to ask for reports back, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| either every six months or annually about the number of cats and see if it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| I had been inclined to support it, but I'm supportive of the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| I don't think there's a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| We do have an animal control board to hear their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| and receive additional information about whether this program is effective and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| I think it is, you know, it is a pretty big policy change of releasing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| a domesticated animal, you know, back into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| So I think we should certainly take our time and be thoughtful of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| So I just want to be clear on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| I'm not sure whether I'm going to support it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| So what exactly are we asking the animal control board to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| Are we asking for their review of this ordinance to provide a recommendation to the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| Are we asking them to come up with a solution to the feral cat overpopulation problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5292)|
| 1:28:20| Are we what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| I'm not clear on what the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| I would want to provide, if I were to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| I would want it to be a very clear ask of the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| So I'm not entirely sure of the makeup of the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| I think we have two people who are both on the animal control board that are on opposite sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5323)|
| 1:28:52| And so I think it's curious to me that it didn't go to them before it came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| I also think I'm not a scientist, but I am married to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| I certainly got an earful from him on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| He had lots of opinions and thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| When we say that TNR, like the Nashville example, TNR, less cats come into Nashville, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5353)|
| 1:29:21| Lauren, I'm sorry, I remember your first name for obvious reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| That less cats now come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| Well, we would expect the same thing here, just as an off-the-hip thing, because we're going to catch cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| they're going to get their ears tipped, and the animal control officers are going to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| Well, somebody's going to call and say there's a cat and he's loose and he's annoying and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Would you like to come to the mic so we can answer the question about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| I just think it's an obvious thing, and of course the numbers are going to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| but who are we working with to actually survey have the colonies decreased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| Where are we counting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| Who's counting the cats other than what comes in on the calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| Well, what comes in, but you have to also understand that I don't send the officers out to retrieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| Right, it's complaint-driven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| It is complaint-driven, but we do not pick up stray cats that are not sick or injured anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5409)|
| 1:30:15| Any more or before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| No, we actually started before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| Before you passed the TNR ordinance, you picked up sick and injured cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| We still pick up sick and injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| We do not pick up healthy cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| Strays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Do we pick up all strays because we have an ordinance here, no loose animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5431)|
| 1:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| So as the community learns and as the officers are trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| don't pick up the animals with the tipped ears, the numbers are going to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| So I don't think that that's a, I mean, Mark, you have a science degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| Help me out with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| It's not going to, the number's going to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| So how do we know who's measuring and surveying the actual animals out there living in abandoned buildings that the colony's gone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5458)|
| 1:31:06| Well, and I think that's a valid question, but I think that if you look at it in terms of the way Nashville did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| there is no correlation because we never picked them up to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| So we just accept that we have large numbers of non-native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| So what I'm saying, though, is your response was that we're just not going to pick up the ear-tipped cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5479)|
| 1:31:25| so therefore less are going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| That was not what Nashville went through, and yet we still have less coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| So that type of correlation is not valid in the statistics that I just gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| Do you have less coming in because you changed your rules about what you pick up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| Well, in the beginning, yes, but that's not when I quoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| From the time that we stopped picking up, because that, again, anybody can skew statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| I can tell you that 1,300 stray cats were coming in until the TNR program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| until I came along and said, absolutely not, we're not picking up stray cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| Then it went to 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| After the TNR program, it went below three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| So there's still a drastic decline of 50%, and that's from the TNR program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| And the spay and neuters, that is not from me changing the policy of we're not picking up feral cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| So, again, in that aspect, what I'm saying is the correlation that you're making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| there was still a significant difference beyond our officers saying no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5547)|
| 1:32:34| But there's no evidence that the cat population decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Because you're not looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| We're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| You're less calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| We do have less calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| We have less nuisance calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| Our officers have, we have less sick and injured calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5571)|
| 1:32:59| Okay, Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| Chief Thomas, this is coming from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| So I just wanted to check in on, I believe it's Officer Keith Hogue, who is over animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5584)|
| 1:33:11| Were there conversations between you and him, and what were those like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5591)|
| 1:33:21| We did have conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| You know, we support whatever the council votes upon here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| So we did have conversations regarding the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| There is a cat problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| So, I mean, I can tell you that we did have conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| He was on board with this TNR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| One more statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| I don't think I've spoken this much all on my council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| We're hearing from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Well, hey, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| You know, I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| I mean, honestly, if all major ornithological organizations and science-based organizations, that we all want the same thing, we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5640)|
| 1:34:09| We don't want to kill cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| We want to save birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Why would they not be behind and support TNR if it were proven long-term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| Again, I don't think we have the evidence we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| As opposed to Vice Mayor Saunders, I don't think we should implement a program without having more input from the city's animal control board who handles this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5660)|
| 1:34:28| So I think we need more input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| I think Councilwoman Ryder has put forward a good proposal to postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| and we have people on the animal control board here that may be willing to have a meeting about it and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| Why are we going to rush this through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| We all want answers, but let's not implement a policy that we are not certain is going to have benefits in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5685)|
| 1:34:53| Again, we could talk about this all night, but I'm just going to leave that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| Councilwoman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| Well, I do understand that, and under most circumstances, I probably would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| So I spoke with some folks in the animal community who have followed similar types of practices for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| This is not the first time this conversation has come up in Knoxville, and it didn't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| And so there's just not agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| There isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| And, I mean, I would hope that the animal control board could find an agreement and present an ordinance that we would be able to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5729)|
| 1:35:39| What I'm seeing is that there are ordinances in other communities that there's science and there's practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5739)|
| 1:35:49| And what I'm hearing from our practitioners is we see that there's a difference in the number of animals that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5749)|
| 1:35:57| and the number of complaints in the cat population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| So I would be inclined to support the ordinance with a direction to the animal control board to monitor the outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5762)|
| 1:36:15| and make a recommendation for adjustment if they have some additions or better solutions that they would like to use to complement this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5775)|
| 1:36:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| As has been said, you know, one of my favorite expressions is that good and reasonable people often disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| and this is kind of the poster child for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| Are we going to put that in, I guess, in our ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| Are we going to ask for that to be revised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| Because you just mentioned that you want the board, the animal control board, to monitor the progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5810)|
| 1:36:59| Can I request or do we have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Let's first vote on the substitute motion and see where that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| And then if that passes, then we'll follow through with what this motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5827)|
| 1:37:15| If it doesn't pass, then we'll vote on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| If that passes, then I think the animal control board will know about this for those who aren't here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5840)|
| 1:37:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| Just in terms of the timeline, Mayor, our next meeting is January 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| and the animal control board meeting would be the third Thursday, so it would be the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5854)|
| 1:37:41| Well, the motion is for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| It's for eight, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| So if it fails, we'll be voting on it twice before the animal control board had time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| So I'm not sure if that's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| If it's postponed eight weeks, it wouldn't come back to you until in February, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| But I guess I was thinking if they were meeting the second Thursday, we could vote on it in first reading, pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| and then we'd still have a second reading of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| So what I'm saying is there's going to be two readings before the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5887)|
| 1:38:17| Which you could vote to delay the second reading if the substitute motion-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| Never heard that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Let's just vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| I'm just going to call for the vote, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| We're all confused, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| So the vote right now-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| Can I just say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| I would advise my motion to postpone six weeks, not eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| Six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| Not eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| And where's the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Who had the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| So the motion is to postpone for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| So that's what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| I think we've had enough discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| So the motion is to substitute for six weeks and ask the animal control board to review and recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| Basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5945)|

| 1:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| I need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5955)|

| 1:39:17| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| What am I voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| Yes, I support your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Vice Mayor Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Councilwoman Singh-Perez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5973)|

| 1:39:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| So the substitute motion fails six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| So we're back to the original motion, which is to pass this ordinance as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5981)|
| 1:39:48| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| I'm going to assume that's the same, two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| No, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| I'm a yes vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| So this passes seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| Thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| This is, like you said, animals are always tough issues when they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| I've seen this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| It comes before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| Thank you, everyone who came on either side, both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| So now we are on 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| 12C is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $6,670 from the Office of Community Relations Save Our Sons Budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6027)|
| 1:40:34| and donating the same to Discovery Lab Global to allow it to continue its programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| of developing valuable technical and social skills for inner city youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6053)|
| 1:41:01| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| We are finished with the regular agenda, so we now have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| There are two people who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| The first is Ms. Vivian Scheip followed by Samuel Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| Ms. Scheip, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| As you know, please state your name and address for the record and keep an eye on the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6075)|
| 1:41:27| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| As the year draws to a close, I've come to extend an invitation for you to join me Friday, December 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6090)|
| 1:41:38| at 6 p.m. in BMC's parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| It is at that time on the shortest day of the year that we will gather to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| and call the names of those homeless who died in Knoxville in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| We're going to also remember those whose names we do not know who died in the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| under the bridges and overpasses, along with no home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| Last year, over 33 names were called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| This year may be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Next year, we have an opportunity to lower this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| We have to work hard to stem this tide of unnecessary death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| This year, with the sweep of Broadway, those who need affordable housing have been spread across this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6137)|
| 1:42:25| In order for this number to be reduced, we the people, and I say we the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6145)|
| 1:42:32| because we elected you, and your actions represent the moral conscience of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| we must turn our attention to creating housing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| It can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| We do not have to wait a few years for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| We've swept, paved, gated, and are guarding an empty prime downtown property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6168)|
| 1:42:56| and we did it in just three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| We turned an empty building on Lake Shore that had sat empty for over a decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| into a top-of-the-line administration building for the city in under six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| We can create housing without it taking three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| The upcoming budget must reflect our desire to make affordable housing for our local citizens a top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6196)|
| 1:43:24| Monies allotted for building housing and monies given to nonprofits who provide services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6204)|
| 1:43:31| should be as much, if not more, as the millions allotted to move people into the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6211)|
| 1:43:40| If the last five town hall meetings that were held have shown us anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| it has shown us the face of those who need affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| including aged-out youths who have no business being dropped off in front of a shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| with all their clothes in a plastic bag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| or the elderly with no family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| or whole families on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| or those who have jobs but cannot afford the rents to live in decent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| This administration will go into the history books for the rebirth of the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| The true legacy for which it should desire to be remembered for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| is that of the intentional effort to help the least of us, our voiceless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| There have been many ribbon-cuttings this year for new venues and buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| We need to make sure we end 2019 with many ribbon-cuttings for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| But for now, come and join those you represent on Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| Come and light a candle and remember those who died with no home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| And then let us come back in the new year with a new year's resolution to create housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6290)|
| 1:44:57| so the number we remember next year will not be doubled when we come together at this point next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6297)|
| 1:45:04| I sure hope I see some of you standing among the people standing in the gap this coming Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| We are only as great as the least of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| and only what we will do for God is what's going to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Next is Samuel Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Mr. Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6321)|
| 1:45:30| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| and keep an eye on the timer, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| I'm Sam Emmons, and I live at 301 Woodlawn Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| Thank you, first, for the work that you do for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| I know that there's rarely an end in sight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| and another issue to consider is always right around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| So thank you for persevering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| It's safe to say that there's a lot that I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| but I do hope the thoughts I share tonight are helpful in the best sense I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| My goal is to better the lens through which we see decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| and to understand the motives for decision-making that are sourced in our human nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6374)|
| 1:46:22| So let us gain a clearer picture of what drives our decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| and increase our ability to question those paradigms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| A concrete example with which to consider our decision-making process is the development of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6391)|
| 1:46:40| So upon first impressions, downtown Knoxville generally feels good right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| I enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| But I wonder if in downtown sometimes we want to have our cake and eat it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6407)|
| 1:46:54| What does that even mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| The idea we have is that we can have everything turn out the way we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| the way we picture in our limited way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| All right, it's limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| And without having any negative side effects, whatever negative means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| Everyone wins, we convince ourselves, but that may not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| We have to develop the ability to question our notions about what a downtown ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6437)|
| 1:47:24| And then we have to question our reactionary view to our original thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| Our reactionary view might be, well, I'll just make sure there's plenty of workforce housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| and affordable housing, and those might be a fine strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| Those are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| But it could also be that we're still just trying to have our cake and eat it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| Right now, consumerism, abundance, entertainment, in some ways they're carrying the day in our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6465)|
| 1:47:55| And I know that there's a variety of business that takes place too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| There's lots of good, to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Art is good, food is good, commerce is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| But if we're not careful, we only pursue things that allow us to lavish good upon ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6485)|
| 1:48:12| And we're not really sure what the ramifications are for others or about the long-term effects on ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6492)|
| 1:48:20| We want comfort and control, and we can build a city that seems to give us those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6500)|
| 1:48:30| Self-love can lead us to try to help people or grow the city in ways that emotionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6510)|
| 1:48:38| and intuitively make us feel better about ourselves or the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| that may not actually be best for the people we think we're helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| Self-love and self-importance work together to bring both anxiety and a judgmental spirit towards those around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6530)|
| 1:49:00| And I can easily fall into both of those things, none of which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| But they can still affect the way we make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| So often, instead of trying to build our city or our families or places of employment into something good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6551)|
| 1:49:18| we're trying to build self-pleasing pictures of ourselves and gain the approval of others along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6558)|
| 1:49:27| Am I still just doing whatever I want as long as it makes me happy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| Am I a slave to what people think of me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| Often I find both to be the case for myself, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| So we have to wonder what actually is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| Where does the idea of good come from? Did we make it up? Does it exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| We probably have different notions of this concept than the person sitting next to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| Is your good having everything work out according to your plan, my plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| Not complete, not all-encompassing, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| And another thing is that according to the teachings of Jesus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| what's really good is to love God, love our neighbors, care for orphans and widows in their distress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6614)|
| 1:50:22| And that's what I want to imagine a downtown affected by those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| where people extend kindness to those who were formerly their enemies or just their next-door neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6628)|
| 1:50:37| So that's my hope for our city, for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| Thank you again for the work you do for our city, and have a Merry Christmas. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| Thank you, Mr. Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| Council, that is the end of public forum, and so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| I hope everyone has a great holiday. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181218?start=6653)|
