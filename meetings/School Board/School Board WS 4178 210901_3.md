| 5:21:45| Sure, yeah, I mean, I can definitely ask about that specifically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19305)|
| 5:21:51| Thank you, Ms. Christie. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19311)|
| 5:21:54| Thank you, Madam Chair. I think some of the reason why we're getting so many questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19314)|
| 5:21:58| about this is because how much more transmission there is with the Delta variant in kids. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19318)|
| 5:22:05| mean, we didn't see near the number of kids getting infected last year as we have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19325)|
| 5:22:10| year. So, just to be clear, the information that we would provide, should we have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19330)|
| 5:22:18| to the health department, is directory information, a seating chart, and is there anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19338)|
| 5:22:23| in that list, if we had it, we would provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19343)|
| 5:22:31| I can't think of anything offhand that would be included in our SIS that we legally, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19351)|
| 5:22:38| know what I mean, that we legally wouldn't be able to give them. I'm trying to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19358)|
| 5:22:45| of an example. We've tried to provide principals with examples of things that we will share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19365)|
| 5:22:49| but you've just listed all of them. So, I can't think of anything we would say, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19369)|
| 5:22:54| absolutely not, as long as we don't cross that line into we're actually doing the contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19374)|
| 5:23:00| tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19380)|
| 5:23:01| Right. So, I'm only asking you this because I told you in advance I would, so I know you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19381)|
| 5:23:05| ready, even though it's 11 o'clock. Is there anything that you feel like we can do to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19385)|
| 5:23:12| what we're doing in contact tracing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19392)|
| 5:23:16| You know, I think that our primary objective, and this again is something we've been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19396)|
| 5:23:23| on in an ongoing fashion, is to become more efficient. How can we get the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19403)|
| 5:23:30| that they request to them faster? I know Lisa Wagner worked with the epidemiology folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19410)|
| 5:23:38| over at the health department to develop a spreadsheet and do a couple things to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19418)|
| 5:23:42| to get that information faster. I know that we worked to identify specific contacts within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19422)|
| 5:23:47| each school using our school nursing staff, again in an effort to just become more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19427)|
| 5:23:54| and become faster. The issue is essentially what you just said, right? We're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19434)|
| 5:24:00| a situation where really and truly if we activated our nurses tomorrow to go contact trace, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19440)|
| 5:24:07| still not going to catch up, right? We're dealing with a different situation entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19447)|
| 5:24:13| And that's exactly what the health department today told me, too. I called them and asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19453)|
| 5:24:17| that very question, if our nurses were doing it with you, and they said we would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19457)|
| 5:24:22| be behind without a doubt. The one thing that they stressed was information. So as I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19462)|
| 5:24:29| the discussion, the only thing that I really have questions about and wondering why is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19469)|
| 5:24:35| contact tracing by definition hinges on information that's available, right? You can't do contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19475)|
| 5:24:41| tracing unless you have information about who people have been in contact with. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19481)|
| 5:24:46| fair to say? That is correct. Part of contact tracing, however, is identifying who people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19486)|
| 5:24:54| have been around, right? So once I get into, you know, now I'm contact tracing for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19494)|
| 5:25:00| because I've told you who they've been around. I've done that investigation. Right, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19500)|
| 5:25:04| there's the investigative side. But the investigation can, the more information that's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19504)|
| 5:25:09| in the investigation, the quicker it can potentially occur, right? Absolutely, yeah. So the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19509)|
| 5:25:14| information, well the more accurate information that we have that we share with them, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19514)|
| 5:25:19| faster we share it, the better position they're in to conduct the investigation, yes. So my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19519)|
| 5:25:23| only question then is if we were doing seating charts last year, and I know some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19523)|
| 5:25:28| had to do with distancing, we had 20,000 kids out in virtual and there was more room to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19528)|
| 5:25:33| do that and all those types of things, is are we unintentionally hamstringing the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19533)|
| 5:25:39| department's ability to do that quickly by not asking our teachers to do seating charts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19539)|
| 5:25:46| I don't, well I definitely don't think that was the spirit of not requiring teachers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19546)|
| 5:25:50| have it. Well, that's why I said unintentionally. I didn't think it was the spirit of it. Certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19550)|
| 5:25:55| you know, we want teachers to have the autonomy in their classroom to manage it as they see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19555)|
| 5:25:58| fit. Last year was an anomaly, so we asked them, hey, make sure you have, we need everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19558)|
| 5:26:02| to have seating charts. It's certainly, again, having seating charts in cafeterias and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19562)|
| 5:26:07| common areas would, in my measure, be an anomaly. So, you know, I think that as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19567)|
| 5:26:13| launched the start of the school year, looking at the information that we had available to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19573)|
| 5:26:17| us in terms of what it looked like with the spread of COVID-19 in our summer programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19577)|
| 5:26:23| we also had summer camps going on for extracurriculars and saw very little spread of COVID-19. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19583)|
| 5:26:28| heading into the school year, none of us were necessarily thinking, man, we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19588)|
| 5:26:32| sure everybody, every single teacher has a seating chart because that's not really a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19592)|
| 5:26:36| practice that we would have had in the past to enforce that, other than, again, last year doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19596)|
| 5:26:43| So, I agree. I think during this summer, like, I love not being masked and, I mean, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19603)|
| 5:26:48| around a lot of different places, right? Like, things were very different. And if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19608)|
| 5:26:52| at the data, it tells you that, too. But we also have said consistently in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19612)|
| 5:26:57| schools that as things change, we would adjust as well. And I think one of the things we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19617)|
| 5:27:02| might want to consider is asking our teachers to do that because there's no doubt that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19622)|
| 5:27:09| health department, it is their job to contact trace, but they are very, very behind. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19629)|
| 5:27:14| I would think that they could do that more efficiently and effectively if they had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19634)|
| 5:27:19| information. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19639)|
| 5:27:22| Thank you. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19642)|
| 5:27:24| Thank you, Madam Chair. Is there anything to prohibit our teachers from telling their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19644)|
| 5:27:29| class if they have tested positive? Let's say I'm a teacher and I test positive. Can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19649)|
| 5:27:35| I tell my students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19655)|
| 5:27:39| I'm not aware of a policy or anything. I'd have to defer to Mr. Dupler to see if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19659)|
| 5:27:44| anything that would prohibit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19664)|
| 5:27:47| And if I can tell you why I'm asking, I've heard from lots of teachers who are very distressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19667)|
| 5:27:53| because, well, they've tested positive. They can't, they've been told by either a supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19673)|
| 5:28:01| or their principal that they are not to tell their students. They've been told we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19681)|
| 5:28:06| contact tracing, you can't talk about it. And so, they want to tell their students that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19686)|
| 5:28:14| they've potentially, you know, that they've been exposed. And they're being told that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19694)|
| 5:28:20| they can't. And so, I'd like some clarification for our teachers on whether they can or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19700)|
| 5:28:27| Like I said, I can work with Mr. Dupler and see if there's anything specifically that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19707)|
| 5:28:34| would prohibit it. I guess, you know, if we look at it as something other than, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19714)|
| 5:28:40| this anomaly that's COVID-19, I guess my question would be how appropriate would it be for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19720)|
| 5:28:45| teacher to share any of their personal health information with students, right? I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19725)|
| 5:28:51| obviously COVID-19 is a different thing. But I think it's, I think the question that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19731)|
| 5:28:56| asking, I think I would have to give it a little bit more consideration, to be quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19736)|
| 5:29:01| honest. Because I don't know, you know, if we were just talking about a general health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19741)|
| 5:29:05| condition, would that be appropriate use of instructional time or school resources? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19745)|
| 5:29:13| my gut answer on that right now would be probably not. But I also recognize that COVID-19 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19753)|
| 5:29:21| an anomaly. So, I think that's something I'd like to discuss maybe more with Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19761)|
| 5:29:26| I'm thinking that it wouldn't be school resources because they are already at home. And, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19766)|
| 5:29:31| know, they have that contact information. If I were a teacher with flu and I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19771)|
| 5:29:36| that I had exposed students, I think I would want to tell them too. And I don't think we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19776)|
| 5:29:41| ever told teachers that they couldn't do that. And something just to consider, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19781)|
| 5:29:49| that the health department can use non-medical volunteers for contact tracing, but they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19789)|
| 5:29:54| so far behind that they are not even currently able to contact those volunteers. If it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19794)|
| 5:30:03| be possible to use some kind of ESSER funds to hire some temporary clerical help that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19803)|
| 5:30:09| we could maybe loan them as we do with other things to help with their contact tracing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19809)|
| 5:30:17| I think that would be significant. Thank you. And, Mr. Myers, you may not know this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19817)|
| 5:30:25| I would assume that the health department is probably getting additional federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19825)|
| 5:30:29| Do you know? Any idea? I don't, to be honest. You know, I know that based on some conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19829)|
| 5:30:36| we've had, I know they're, you know, trying to build out their staff with additional folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19836)|
| 5:30:42| But beyond that, I would have to definitely defer to somebody from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19842)|
| 5:30:47| Okay. I mean, I worry about with seating charts. That's one more thing to put on teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19847)|
| 5:30:54| So, I don't know. That would be a concern, I think. And I think it's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19854)|
| 5:30:59| that we have about 1% of Knox County residents are COVID positive, and that's the same percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19859)|
| 5:31:07| that we have in our schools. So, at least it's comparable. I mean, I think last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19867)|
| 5:31:11| our numbers were lower than the community. So, it's the same number. So, it's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19871)|
| 5:31:18| reassuring to me that at least we're not higher than the community at large as far as a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19878)|
| 5:31:26| Okay. Any other questions or comments on this? Okay. Thank you. So, we have another meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19886)|
| 5:31:38| which I forgot for a few minutes, and now I'm reminded. So, oh, yes. We'll adjourn that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19898)|
| 5:31:46| one. Sorry. Okay. Now, before we get into this, I have a question for board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19906)|
| 5:31:54| Would you like to take a few minutes break, or would you like to just quickly go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19914)|
| 5:31:58| this? I'm not sure how many questions people have on this agenda. So, I hope not many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19918)|
| 5:32:04| Because we're going to talk about it again next week, too. Yeah, there's another opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19924)|
| 5:32:08| Right. So, can we super fly through it, you guys think? Or tell me? Because I'm fine to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=19928)|
