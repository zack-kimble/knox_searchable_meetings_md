| 0:11:06| cast a ballot early in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=666)|

| 0:11:11| who helped make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=671)|

| 0:11:22| and in our country during this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| We can have different opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| we can support different candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| but I encourage everyone in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| to respect each other and to respect the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=690)|

| 0:11:35| And if you do see anything that threatens public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| tonight or any other night of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| please call 911 immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=700)|

| 0:11:45| and in the days ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| So now a little update about COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| I know you all are tracking the status of the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| And I don't need to go into the details of the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| All the numbers are going in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| As many of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I'm part of a new alliance called Knoxville Recovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| It's a group of community leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| that seeks to help Knoxville fully recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| from the effects of COVID-19 across all sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| This past week, we issued our first official message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| and the message is wear a mask and get a flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| One of the members of our group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| State Senator and Dr. Richard Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| said he cannot stress enough the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| of wearing a mask indoors in public places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| and to get the flu vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Dr. Briggs said that contracting a COVID-19 infection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| while recovering from the flu could lead to serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| or even deadly complications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| So all of the advice that Dr. Buchanan and her team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| have been giving us all along stays true to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| But the main thing I think city council can help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| is just continuing to encourage people to maintain vigilance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| and don't let down their guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| because there's more COVID in our community now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| We see it in all different parts of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| There's no single place, there's no single business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| there's no single type of location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| where you can be free of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| or where you're certain to be exposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| It's sort of pervasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| So be careful and please encourage everyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=791)|

| 0:24:15| over the life of these existing bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| I'd like to ask Deputy Mayor David Race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| to share a bit more background information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| and then happy to take any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| and listen to council's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Mr. Race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Yeah, thank you very much, mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| and good evening, city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| So the 130, I just wanted to break that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| The mayor did a great job of summarizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| the scope of this bond resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| So 60 million is exactly a refinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| So there's better rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Those rates equate to savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| about 4.7 million over the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| And so that's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| The other 70 million is new bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| to cover a number of important projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| that have previously been approved by council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| through the budget process, capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| And actually you've seen a lot of the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| that have gone towards the design, construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| or environmental work for many of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| So again, many of these projects are well underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| Some of them are nearly completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| And so because our finance team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| and previous councils and mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| have done a good job in this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| obviously of managing our resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| we're able to cashflow the initial phases of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| We don't have to take out debt early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| We've got enough to cashflow these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| up to a certain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| That saves us on interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| But these projects are now at the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| where we need to go out and secure the loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| the debt for the long-term haul with these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| It is important to note that city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| I know one of these, the public safety and all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| actually the 70 million were all discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| and there was an initial bond resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| that council passed in June of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| And again, we clearly stated our intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| that these projects, we would go out to debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| for these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| So we've got some experts on the call here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| including our CFO, Susan Janot, Mark Namentoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| Lauren Lowe with PFM, one of our financial advisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| And I believe Boyce Evans is also on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| So if there's questions, we'll dig into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| and I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Thank you, Mr. Reyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Ms. Butte, Council Member Huger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| First of all, I want to commend the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| for being able to run this without borrowing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| until the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| It's almost like cash flowing a home renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| or something and then when it's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| to do the permanent financing, you replace your cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| which to me sounds like that's what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| on part of it and the other part is refinancing debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| So just kudos for good money management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| that we're not having to borrow money until the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Thank you, Council Member Huger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| I'm not sure who to direct this to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| but I was wondering about the impact on our bond rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| with regard to borrowing this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| I don't know who to direct that to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| but I know we have many experts on the line with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| I think we'll let, Susan is much smarter than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| we'll let our CFO handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Thank you, Commissioner Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| This should not impact our bond rating at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| Certainly the last time that they looked at us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| this plan was taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| I can also turn this over to Lauren Lowe with PFM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| She can give some more particulars on that if you would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| but it has certainly been my understanding from her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| and from their group that this should not impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| our bond rating at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| and we do have a very good bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| Well, I certainly want to maintain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| and I'm glad to hear that that's a consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| and that was what you're seeing is not having an effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| I'd also just like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| I think that being in a position where you can renegotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| and save $4.7 million is a really good place to be as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Absolutely, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Any, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| On this item, I had considered trying to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| I know that we already voted on the capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| but this is, the money is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| for a couple of different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| and I would like to be able to, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| not have everything aggregated but divide it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| so that we can vote on different pieces of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| rather than, you know, I'm 100% in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| of refinancing at a better rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| But I have been speaking up against the public safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| or the police headquarters continuously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| and like I said, I know that that has already been voted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| but I would have preferred to have voted on this in pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| but I spoke with Mr. Mametov and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| in the future, that is something that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| If he's available, I would love for him to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| Mr. Mametov, could you speak to that strategy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| Yeah, I'm glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| I do, I'm Martin Mametov, 1215 Great Oaks Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Not home at the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| but good to see you all this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| When you do a refunding resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| it can be done separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| if you're also doing new money at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| and it certainly was nothing strategic on our part here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| in terms of, as I was telling Seema when we talked earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| when we have a issue of this magnitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| the cost and the refunding report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| that's attached to the exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| we'd like to try to aggregate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| because it gives you all a better idea of the total deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and the expense like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| But there's no legal reason why in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| if requested, that we cannot do the refunding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| as a separate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| What I did, and I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| certainly it's your all's call if you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| I just said it would be really hard to do that tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| because the way boring bond lawyers like me work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| is that we'd like to have a certified resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| exactly in front of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| So unlike some things where you could make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| to consider them separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| here, we would have to review the resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| and resubmit them to you to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| And so, and it wouldn't take a ton of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| and I'd be glad to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| but it would result in some delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| But yes, Councilwoman Singh is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| We could, in the future, separate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| if you all would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| And I'm not gonna ask for it to be divided tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| Okay, thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you, Mr. Mamentow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Council Member Spitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Yeah, I guess this question is for Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| At what point during these capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| is a designation made where extra financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| will be needed in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Or is that done later on an annual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| where you assess open capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| and then apply or determine which projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| require additional financing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Well, I think we anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| when the authorization resolution went in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| we knew that we needed to go out for debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| for the $70 million, up to $70 million for these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| We knew that many of these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| interest rates are low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| And so it's a balance of having cash on hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| and also just like your home budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| having debt that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| And oftentimes large infrastructure projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| it makes a lot of sense when money is cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Buildings, big capital items like the Gateway Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| even sidewalks and paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| there are times that that makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| And so our finance department, we're very fortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Mr. York was at the helm for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Ms. Janot, we work with financial advisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| with people like Mark Namentoff and Lauren Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| PFM is a global financial advisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| and we've also used Cumberland Investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| And so they help guide us on the ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| between how much we want to have in debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| and that debt service and what we can carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| and how much we want to have in the bank, cash in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| And so what makes sense to pay for directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| what makes sense to go out for debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| And so that's a pretty simple answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| I'm sure Mark Namentoff or Lauren or Susan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| can provide more details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| but we knew these projects were going to require a debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| for a number of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| but mainly because of their magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| and the fact that interest rates are low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Council Member Huguet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Just to follow up on what Mr. Brace said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| that's why we voted and we approved debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| every time we approved one of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| We go ahead and approve the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| And what this is, is to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| is we've just held off as long as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| before we had to go to the market and actually borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| I think that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you, Council Member Huguet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| Now, Council Member Parkin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| At what point should we expect a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| on how we're doing financially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| I expected us to resolve some accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| at some point before this time of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| So I was wondering if that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| Well, I guess, Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| if you have specific questions, I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I mean, Ms. Juneau is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| And if council as a whole wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| you know, discuss that as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| then, you know, there's an opportunity to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| Oh, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| What I mean is when we did the budgeting process this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| it was explained to us that about October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| the finance department would come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| We would have to reconcile some accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| deal with some transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| see how, you know, state taxes turned out this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| And how do you sort of update on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| That's gonna happen, I think, in not next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| but the meeting after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Is that right, Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Is that we're expecting to have some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Yeah, so Mayor and Council Member Parker, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| So our finance department and the support staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| throughout the city and our financial advisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| are always looking at the revenues that we receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| and where those stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| where our projections on target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| were they low, were they high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Obviously, COVID was a unique year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| So right now, Ms. Juneau and the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| are taking those assessments and projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| and seeing where they landed on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| We'll be presenting information to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| and I'm sure that we can provide a summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| on that here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| I think you also know that the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| works throughout the year to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| we close out the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| There's always the CAFR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| There's so much information available to anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| council or members of the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| on our finance department homepage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| And so I'd encourage you to look at that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| but we're in the process right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| and we will be briefing the mayor in the very near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| about the status of our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| compared to projections made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| Perfect, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Thank you, Ms. Parker, thank you, Mr. Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Any further questions about item 11E, the bond issuance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| Okay, seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2216)|

| 0:39:02| and technological upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2342)|

| 0:39:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| I would like to hear more details on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| I know that when we voted on it at our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| which was the last time we met in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| there were some unanswered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| So I think there's somebody from the school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Yeah, Knox County Schools Chief of Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Gus Produces, is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Mr. Produces, could you unmute yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| and help us understand the purpose of this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| The school systems role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| we will primarily focus on some blast-resistant film| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| that'll be placed around all the entrances and windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| And it's actually a continuation of some funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| that we are then able to obtain from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| And so most of the emphasis on our side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| will be site improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| We'll do the blast-resistant film.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| We have purchased several hundred radios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| with previous COPS grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| And so we'll purchase some additional radios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| that will be given to school personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| that are actually on site with the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| And then we're gonna pay for a annual renewal fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| for at least the next two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| to help update and renew our visitor management program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| And we have a visitor management system in every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| that was actually paid for by the initial COPS grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| So this is our second successful partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| And obviously there is some training in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| that we'll send many of our officers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| over the course of the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| Ms. Singh, did you wanna have any follow-up questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| I do, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| The cost for the trainings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I'm assuming there was one this year, but it got canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| And then I see that it's for the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| You know, and that's a big chunk of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| Is that something that can be done on Zoom is one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| The second question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| I am wondering about the National School Safety Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| What type of education are they doing for the SROs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| Mr. Palacios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Yes, ma'am, there's a variety of different trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Now we send officers every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| to the state SRO conference that's in Pigeon Forge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| And we typically have done that with state grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| And this year we had officers earmarked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| to go to the National SRO Conference in Dallas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| which was canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| The School Safety Advocacy Council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| obviously this year was canceled as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| And so we plan to send about a third of our workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| over the course of the next three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| probably a different third every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| to either Pigeon Forge, to the state conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| or to the national conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| wherever it may be held over the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| of the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| I think one year's in Florida, one year's in Colorado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| and we're not sure of the third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| And of course, I think I can speak for many of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| We hope some of these Zoom meetings go away in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| And with it, probably some of the Zoom conferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| And so we look forward to getting back on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| Because I would tell you, we've not done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| as much training this year as we would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| And of course, one of the ways you get better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| is you train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| And so we're gonna be a little bit behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| And so we're anxious to get some of our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| some different exposure to some different viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| over the course of the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Thank you, Mr. Producers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Ms. Singh, do you have some more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| The reason I was asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I guess it's the philosophy of training behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| because of the incident that occurred at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| I believe it was Bearden High School earlier this semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| where the situation got worse once an officer got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| So my concerns are about what type of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| and I want them to be an asset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| not something that ends up making the situation worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| which is what seems to have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Now, one thing that should be apparent in the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| is of course, we're using some of that money for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| And then the police department is using a significant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| of their grant funds for training as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| And we get extensive training every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| from Knox County school personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| on the best way to deescalate situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| and how to deal with diverse and special populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| And I'm familiar with the Bearden High incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| and I think we can all look back at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| and realize that there's always the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| to look back and in hindsight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| figure out ways that you can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| And I think ultimately we will all learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| from that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| And so we get training on those particular topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| from a variety of different sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| both locally, as well as across our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| as well as nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2682)|

| 0:46:17| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| Wanted a little bit more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2781)|

| 0:46:29| and how this might impact the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| Why do we have the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Amy Brooks is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| Ms. Brooks is our Acting Director of Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Ms. Brooks, could you address us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Good evening, Council Members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Amy Brooks, Knox-Lenox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| I'm not sure that I can address what their plans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| in terms of expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| And I don't know that I see the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I don't know if the applicant's available to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| But I do know that they do have some plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| to improve the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| Could you explain why they need this new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| in order to improve the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Sure, so this is one of the comparable zoning requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| that you all have seen over the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| The machine shop is currently in active use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| which is not permitted in the RN4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| It was previously zoned I3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| So in part of the update to the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| it was zoned RN4, which there are some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| what looks like residences directly adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| And I have to be honest, it's unclear whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| they're actually, for tax purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| they're designated as residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| but I'm not 100% sure that they're used for those purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| So that's the reason that this comes before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| It does, the industrial use does comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| with the Central City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| which is one of the reasons why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| the Planning Commission recommended approval of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2890)|

| 0:48:14| Ms. Brooks, my understanding from a review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| of this agenda item is this is another example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| of a property that's surrounded by industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| that was chosen to be rezoned by staff review of the maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| and the applicant came back for a post-recode review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| to get their zoning back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=2917)|

| 0:50:46| I'd like to ask Mr. Lansden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3046)|

| 0:51:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Carl H. Lansden, 1201 Clinch Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Thank you for the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Vice Mayor McKenzie, and council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| Basically, last week, my consultant and I had a webinar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| through the Office of City Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| It was about a two-hour webinar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| and there has been some false information put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| This apartment project is income-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| There has been rumor mill and innuendo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| from just a select few that have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| that this is project-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| this would be a project-based voucher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| which is totally false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Mr. Bunch and I stayed on the webinar last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| in excess of an hour and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| and this is gonna be a income-based apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| about 60% of average median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| This will be your caregivers to your parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| your nurses, mechanics, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| So this will totally be income-based apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| Okay, Vice Mayor McKenzie, do you wanna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| yeah, keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Yeah, Mr. Lansing, do you have some plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| for some commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| I do, I do, Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Basically, my architect and I are planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| on neighborhood commercial, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| more or less of two acres fronting on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| and we would like to, there is a T-dot cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| about in the middle of that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| approximately about where the old Holiday Inn office is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| We would like to move that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| approximately about 75 feet east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| towards the end of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| The access road to the apartments will elbow in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| and the majority of the parking for the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| will be along that elbow following up the access road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| where you won't see a lot of blacktop or what have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| for the commercial from Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| Thank you, Mr. Lansing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Any further questions, Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I just wanna make a comment, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I wanna thank the Office of Neighborhoods, Debbie Sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| along with Town Hall East for helping to coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| a community meeting that Mr. Lansing referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| that was held via Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| I think it was very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| I've received a lot of feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| regarding this project and this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| This property is one that I'm very intimately familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| as I pass it every day when I leave my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| and have seen it sit there blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| for the last probably 11 plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| And so taking all that feedback into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| I am gonna move to approve this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| as it will be good to have some development there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| residential as well as retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| And so I'm gonna make a motion to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| Motion made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| Second, Council Member Ryder, are you seconding it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| or do we have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| I had some additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| Well, let's see if there's a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| on the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| I'll second it so we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| We have to have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| on the floor to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Motion made by Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| seconded by Council Member Spivitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Council Member Ryder, please go ahead with your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Some of my questions, I guess, may be for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| I'll start with Mr. Lansden since he's on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| So Mr. Lansden, one of the things when you and I discussed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| was that you're still working on your plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| and you don't have plans from your architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| We initially, I have owned this site for four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| and we initially were gonna take the existing hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| and we were gonna take two hotel rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| and turn them into a one bedroom apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| affordable housing for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| But with one bedrooms, which is unfortunately the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| the rent from the one bedrooms wouldn't cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| to pay the construction debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| So we basically scrapped that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| after about two and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| of trying to constantly go through the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| and parse them time after time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| but it wouldn't pay off the construction debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| So I've since come up with this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| to basically demolish the hotel, new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| and everybody seems a lot more appreciative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| of getting rid of the old hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| and going with the new construction on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| So with the previous plan was under the previous zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| and with that, you were required to bring forth plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| and you got community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| I rewatched the 2017 Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| There was community support, but no opposition at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| and there were plans for people to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| So you paid for plans for that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| and that was to be subsidized as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| because it was for seniors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| It was affordable housing for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Yes, we applied to the Office of City Redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| with Becky Way for a affordable housing grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| Okay, so that project was not with state funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| You weren't attempting state funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| I was still attempting a bond deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| I actually went through the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| and got the bond allocation paid for my IDB meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| attorneys, what have you, because we had a deadline to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| and then obviously we made the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| but then once we tried to, not getting too technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| but we tried to get a low interest tax credit loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| through the banks, what's normally known as a CITC loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| And we went about three different directions on financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| and none of the rates were low enough, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| to sustain a positive cashflow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| to pay off the construction debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Okay, and that was for 115 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| Okay, so the old zoning allowed you to do the 115 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| in the office because it was a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| for an R2 use in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| That may be more of a question for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| Are you, Council Member Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| are you asking me for how many units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| they would have been allowed under the old code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| I'm not sure that I can speak to that with the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| I'm asking you to confirm the previous approved plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| Sorry, that's a dangerous catchphrase there for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| The previously vetted set of plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| for the senior apartments was 115 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| and it was allowed under office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| That is correct, because that was-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| Yes, R2 uses were allowed as a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Okay, but under the new zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| that we adopted last August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| and went into effect this January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| the best case is for different zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| and office is not optimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| because it doesn't allow apartments and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| There is a limit on the number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| that are allowed in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Okay, so in reviewing things with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| and reviewing some of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| that I've been seeing in feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| one of the issues that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| is the zoning that we're being presented with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| to approve here, CG1, doesn't require any review of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| So there's no public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| there's no opportunity for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| to know what is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| Whereas with the previous set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| of community supported approved plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| the use on review required plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| And now that's no longer required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| No, no longer is the use on review process required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| Okay, so this particular zoning example for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| has shown me a shortcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| to the zoning code that we adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| One of the reasons that was cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| for adopting the new zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| is that we took, we had better standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| more intensive landscaping standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| less parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| As examples, Ms. Brooks could probably fill in the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| that I'm not remembering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Setbacks were different, more urban setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| If you look at the sector plan for this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| there's a talk about making things urban and walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| and how the public input from the 2014 sector plan required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| had a strong response of community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| and case-by-case analysis of rezoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3669)|
| 1:01:17| And my hesitations with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| are that there is no use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| and there is no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| there is no anything that requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| some of the things cited in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| and design standards that are cited in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| design standards that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| that can be implemented or required in the CN zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| or the CG2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| And I think some of the public pushback on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| is they don't know what they're approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| And when I look back at some of the Elmington projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| that we as a council approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| the Pond Gap project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| the Southside Flats project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| those all were planned districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| that required elevations and plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| So I have issue with blindly approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| and we, this has nothing to do with Mr. Lansdow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| this particular request per se on that note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| It's just when we changed the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| that was lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| And so now the public doesn't have any sense of comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| of knowing what's going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| even though last time there was a set of plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| for this particular parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| there was a set of plans approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| and it went through a public vetting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| and it got public support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| And so I think some of the discomfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| is because it's a blind acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| and a change from what they approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| and supported last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| And so I'm having difficulty supporting it based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| and I'm having some serious misgivings about the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| because we've taken that part away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| And now the decisions and the review are all done by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| and the public never sees them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| until the work is done on the ground and they drive by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| which I understand would be a positive for this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| because they're living next to a blighted hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| And I drove out there all the way around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| into Sunset Real and all the way up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| and it's a negative detraction to live next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| for those who pass it every day and live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| But Ms. Brooks, when I talked to you this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| you talked about design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| and it turns out that the CG1 doesn't require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| So there's absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| the Elmington projects were very nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| but those design standards won't be applied to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| So my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| why when the rezoning was requested for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| were CG2 and CN, are those comparable options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| and what are the negatives to having those zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| instead of CG1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| Thank you, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| I'm gonna have Stephanie Welch answer that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| and then go to Ms. Brooks if she has something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| Ms. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| You're muted still, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3874)|
| 1:04:34| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3876)|
| 1:04:36| And I just wanted to make a quick comment about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| I think Councilwoman Ryder's making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| some really good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| I would like to just clarify that one of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| one of the things that was discussed in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| as we were updating the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| is that those standards for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| were being increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| So the bar was being raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| and we were also wanting to make the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| more predictable and require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| one of the trade-offs was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| okay, we're gonna raise the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| and by raising those standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| there will be some reduction in things like special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| and use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| particularly when the zoning is in keeping with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| the sector plan and one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| And I think this is a good example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| I think that what, at least my recollection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| of sitting through all the many hours of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| that we all sat through during recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| the entire idea was to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| or a big focus was on increasing density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| and a mix of uses along major corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| and increasing some standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| So landscaping standards, parking standards, setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| And so I think that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| the property owner makes a request for a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| And if that rezoning is recommended by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| after they review the one-year plan and sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| Ms. Brooks can speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| It isn't really the role of staff to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| well, the zoning that you're requesting does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| it is in keeping with that particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| but we're gonna recommend that you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| for a different zoning anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| So Ms. Brooks may speak to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| Sure, Amy Brooks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| So the proposed zoning request is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| with the East City Sector Plan and the one-year plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Mixed use special district references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| EC2 designation in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| There are references to the old code zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| and tools, but the 2014 plan specifically identifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| that the general commercial zoning should be replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| with a zone that allows mixed use building forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| that are more urban in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| That could be multiple stories or smaller setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| and really designed to enhance the pedestrian experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| with allowances for references, parking reductions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| landscape buffers between commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| and residential zone properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| And these are all standards as Ms. Welch just outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| that can be found in the updated code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| and are specifically addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| in the proposed CG zone as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| The CG general commercial zone is intended to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| for a mix of retail, personal service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| office, residential uses along Knoxville's commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| main nodes and corridors, which Asheville Highway is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| And so I think that, you know, to Council Member Ryder's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| question about, you know, CG2 or I think you mentioned CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| but CG2, all the CG zone, all the CG is the same uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| There are some additional design considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| that are taken into account with the CG2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| but all of the, the purpose of the district is the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| as well as the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| So if I'm a developer, why would I choose CG2 ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| in lieu of CG1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Well, because as you, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| For example, you could go higher in the CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| and the CG3 in particular is unlimited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| So there are some reasons that developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| would want to pursue those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| Except for the CG2 has setbacks or step downs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| for being a budding residential, which this property does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| What I appreciate Mr. Landson purchasing this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| and taking it on and making a second attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| at trying to make a project work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| I know folks in East Knoxville want investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| and want to see some of these properties rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| But one thing that he said that stood out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| in the webinar was he wanted the least restrictive zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| There were some questions about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| And so what that says to me is CG1 versus CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| And this morning when I asked questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| about what would be built because there's no plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| there's nothing to review or vet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| because the public has been caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| I agree Ms. Welch, I was there with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| and I remember the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| about making a predictable process and raising the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| But literally what we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| is we've moved everything behind the curtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| and the public only sees it after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| And when we have a process like use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| where things are publicly vetted, the public gets to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| They get to like it or not like it, but they get to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| And it gives them a sense of being a part of their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| and being able to voice their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| Their opinion doesn't have to be right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| doesn't have to be liked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| but now you get to see things go up and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| And with the Elmington projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| there was a public review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| And that is all, I want all of council to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| that our public is letting us know that is all gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| That's not a reflection on Mr. Lansden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| that is a reflection on the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| By making things predictable and raising the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| it's all gone, but the standards for design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| that Ms. Brooks discussed with me this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| are in CG2 and they're not in CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| And so I have some serious concerns about the statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| about wanting to have the least restrictive zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| and not having to have any of the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| which by the way, if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| some of the design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| they are employed in the Elmington projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| But with this project, we have no way of knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| because we've seen no plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| and they're not applicable with the CG1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| So my discussion point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| is CG2 a consideration that would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| for this particular parcel and for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| Okay, thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| Are you, any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| All right, Council Member Kesterman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| There are, I completely appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| Councilwoman Ryder point about involvement of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| And it's been a long time neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| There are a lot of people that have lived there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| and invested in that community for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| So I'm certainly very sensitive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| One thing about it is just, I kind of go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| Mr. Lansdon has had this property now for four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| and is trying to make it, I feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| mutually beneficial to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| And it is private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| And so therefore, he has the prerogative to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4336)|
| 1:12:25| But I also feel like he's tried to be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| And I think moving forward, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| I feel like in just conversations that I've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| that moving forward, I think he's willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| to participate or have the neighborhood participate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| From a development standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| it's incredibly cost prohibitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| to go out and have architectural renderings done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| when you don't know if you're gonna get the code rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| So it's hard to incur that expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| before he's even sure how he's able to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| And so to that point, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| this has been a 30-year blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| where I do feel like he's trying to be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| I see he's raising his hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| but I would like to hear from him just on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| as well, moving forward and how he's willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| and to involve the community when he does have renderings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4406)|
| 1:13:33| Would he be willing to have a community meeting, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| to share his vision for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| again, to dispel any fears or any rumors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| on certain types of housing or whatever the case may be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| Mr. Landsman, did you wanna, are you still on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| Yes, Mayor, can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Yes, could you speak to Ms. Testerman's question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| Yes, every opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| that Town Hall Leased has asked me to meet with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| I've done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| I met Ms. Sondra Korblick several times on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| with my architect, Glenn Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| and about the only request that I couldn't appease them on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| they wanted to keep the existing office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| of the Holiday Inn with the mid-century architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| with the portico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| And as history tells,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| Ms. Ryder's seen me do it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| I've saved houses in Old North and Fourth and Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| that nobody else would touch that's been condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| And believe you me, if that would have been possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| to save that building, I would have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| But the people responsible for the syndication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| on this bond deal, as I told Town Hall Leased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| this is a $15 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| And since that office has no historical significance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| we actually went to Nashville and we were gonna try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| to get historic tax credits on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| but they said there wasn't enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| of the original building left to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| But at every, any from the webinar to meeting Ms. Korblick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4521)|
| 1:15:29| never wanna bore people with personal details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| but up until a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| I lived at 5315 Nashville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| which is less than a mile from this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| My grandfather built that house in the forties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| My grandfather, Hugh Ammons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| was captain of Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| in the fifties and sixties, was my grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| My grandmother, when she was over on ML King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| she was one of the founding members of that church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| before it moved to its current building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| adjacent to this site now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| So had family members that would come visit my grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| that stayed at that motel at the Holiday Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| So I lived in that house at 5315,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| it's own record for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| Everybody on my team is from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| Merritt Construction, they're my general contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| Buddy Hines, Mark Bunch and Christine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| Bunch and Associates, they're here local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| and Partners Company will probably be my project managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| which everybody knows here is local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| So I've got a local team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| and I was literally raised less than a mile down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| So anytime that Town Hall East wants to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| I've never not once met them and I'll be more than happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| even told them that I would incorporate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| They told me, Carl, we'd like to keep our mid-modern theme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| I said, I have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Lynn Johnson, my architect on site told Ms. Corblett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| that he would institute some mid-modern features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| the same way we did with the one bedroom apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| We did the mid-modern architecture in those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| With the existing building, I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| that was a lot more difficult with the existing hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| to try to keep it from looking like a rehab motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| So the new construction, we'll be able to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| a lot more mid-modern architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| which Town Hall East wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| and Burlington seems to like as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Just a couple of quick things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| I know we've talked about Town Hall East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| but I know that they don't necessarily represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| the Holston Hills community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| I don't know if Holston Hills has their own HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| I guess Councilwoman Parker can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| But I think there are some other communities around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| that definitely would want to be represented and included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| But my other point too, is that based on the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| there's, I presume, a likelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| that you may approach the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| from the Affordable Housing Rental Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| And at that point, it would have to come back to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| and go through that public process as well again, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| I guess I can defer to Deputy Welch or Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4701)|
| 1:18:33| Yes, Mayor, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Yes, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| Councilwoman Testerman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| That is absolutely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| If Mr. Lansman decides to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| for Affordable Rental Development funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| if that process moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| this would come back to Council for a vote for funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| if that successfully moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| Thank you, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Ms. Testerman, any further questions at this juncture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| I mean, again, Vice Mayor McKenzie too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| having lived there in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| I would second this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| but I would also please encourage Mr. Lansman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| to continue that public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| with the neighbors and the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| to help them realize your vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| And again, as a good neighbor and a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| for them to be included in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| Thank you, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Councilmember Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| and then we'll go to Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| I share the concerns that I've heard from my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| about the public process and then the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| I went back and reviewed the standards for C3 and C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| in the previous zoning code, and they're three pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| There's no standards in CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| except for setbacks and landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| and those are in every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| So I understand what Councilperson Ryder was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| That being said, I also weigh heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| what the district representative said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| in Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| She lives down the street and drives by a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| that hasn't been used in a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| and I can understand that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| So I think I'm inclined to support this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| but I do think there are structural issues here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| with public process and with design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| that I think do need to get looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Thank you, Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| I've got a question for Mr. Lanza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| Mr. Lanza, I understand you can build apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| and other residential-oriented zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4860)|
| 1:21:07| and I think there's been some suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| to split up the property and have part of it be commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| and have part of it be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| It's kind of a two-parted thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| that will lead to a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| but we also have a planned development process that's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| So I wanted to just ask you why you didn't pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| one of those two options for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| Mr. Lanza?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Did you understand the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| I did, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| I pursued CG with the intention of mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| on the site from the apartments on the back of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4905)|
| 1:21:52| with the density and then the neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| basically Croning Nashville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| And during the webinar last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| one of the questions that was asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| from someone attending the webinar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| why could you not parse the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| So basically, what's applicable now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| What is it RN for for the density needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| on the five acres of the multifamily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| And then the two acres Croning Nashville Highway with the CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| And one of the things I'm currently working on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| I am working on a warehouse at 1403 9th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| 9th Avenue is located off of Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| I'm on the corner of Mitchell and 9th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| And talking to city inspections and city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| I think I'm the first new build warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| once again, in over 35 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| in the warehouse district over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| And I see why now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| But to give you a case in point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| right now I'm currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| this warehouse has been in construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| a steel building for about a year and four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| And one of the reasons that the extenuating circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| and the length of time has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| past the normal construction time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| the tenant requested, my architect and I were calling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| 300 square foot space retail office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| And the tenant changed the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| and wanted to call it retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Well, in having doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| I had to go back and comply with additional parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| civil engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| civil engineering problems on the site that that created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| And I had to deed over a half acre of my existing land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| on an old industrial warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| that's adjacent to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| to be able to, for the additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| And I talked to my civil engineer about this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| And he said, if you parse this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| with two different zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| he said, I can promise you site and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| especially doing new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| where as of last time we were taking the existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| he said, you will have problems such as this arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| And with two different zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| what if you have to have that additional land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| and you stop construction six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| So that's the reason when Town Hall leased and after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| and I might add, this is after I went to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| and they gave me, I had a successful vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| and they said that the CG fit in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| for this address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| But they're just, my civil engineer advised me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| against parsing this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| I've tried to, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| I've been a neighbor in this area for my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| And I've tried to appease the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| as much as I can, hence the reason for the two bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| not the three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| And then once again, this is income-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| There are no project-based vouchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| but putting the restriction on that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| such as two different zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| my civil engineer said, what would happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| if I had to go ahead and get a half an acre additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| in order for some site prep or additional parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| or a detention pond or things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| And I had to wait six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| I could see the bond deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| I could see lawsuits happening and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| let alone the other challenges on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| as far as an old hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| Thank you, Mr. Lansing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| I think Ms. Parker, did you have a question on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| I thought you'd raised your hand before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| Yeah, I'm not sure if Councilman Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| got his full question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| Go ahead, I'll follow you, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| And then we'll go to Vice Mayor McKenzie after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| I live in this area, I'm in Holston Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| so I drive by this area all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| and watch the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| and had some of the same concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| that have already been shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| One of my main concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| which Councilman Ryder covered to some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| is that if we approve the commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| DG, we could have a similar situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| as the first attempt to redevelop this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5197)|
| 1:26:44| where a couple of months down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| the numbers don't work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| and the developer decides a new project is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| to meet cashflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| And I'm concerned that since this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| abuts a residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| we won't be able to have any say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| in that commercial activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| that we just put right next to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| What has been suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| oh, it might be a little coffee shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| doesn't sound too bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| but if it doesn't end up being that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| I have major concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| So it would be my preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| if we could find some sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| I appreciate all the questions that are being asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| because it seems like there is some sort of compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| that could be reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| where the developer is able to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| but the neighborhood is still protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| from adverse commercial activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| that could negatively impact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| And so I'm just racking my brain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| trying to figure out what might be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| One question I had for Mr. Lansden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| we have had proposals come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| where the property owner will agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| in writing with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| that if you do not move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| with the plan you're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| you would not object to the city pursuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| a rezoning of the property back to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| Is that something that you would be in opposition to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| Mr. Lansden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Yes, I most definitely would be in opposition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| One thing that I would like to add through my research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| this former Holiday Inn was built in approximately 1953.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| And the zoning that was used back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| with this existing blotted hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| would be no different than the CG zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| that the MPC commission saw fit for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| It would be 57 years later or 67 years later, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| it would be the exact same zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| that would require that hotel to go on there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| But the site is complicated enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| with a 67-year-old hotel as far as demolishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| And I think mixed use for this site is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| that's what the city, was my understanding with the recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| was trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Everybody agrees mixed use is to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| the highest and best use for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| You know, the density, I tried to keep the density down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| basically no access on Carter Road except for emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| access for fire and ambulance, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| All the access is coming off of Leaveny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| better known as Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| I mean, you know, I've tried to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| the neighborhood at every turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| especially since I've been a fabric of it for my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| Thank you, Mr. Lansing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Ms. Parker, do you have any further questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| or some of your colleagues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| I covered it, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| and then we'll go to Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| I'll speak last, may I let Council Member Ryder go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| Go ahead, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| Mr. Lansing, have you looked at the CG2 zoning code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| Just briefly, like I believe you said it's how many pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| but I just briefly looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| Okay, it's not very many pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| There's a diagram that goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| So you were right, the goal was mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| And I'm not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| The issue is with the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| you get a rezoning and you can do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| And there's no public review or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| Once it's rezoned, you get any of the uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| any or all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| But what I will say is with CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| there's some requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| specifically A is building facades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| that abut a public right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| excluding alleys must not contain blank wall areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| that exceed 30 linear feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| There are examples of that on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| new builds prior to recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| which is why that's in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| So you don't put a giant blank wall against the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| Building facades in excess of 100 linear feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| that about a public right of way, excluding alleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| must have a repeating pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| with no less than two of the following elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| So they're design standards that require you to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| windows and doors that address the streets and right of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| and not giant blank walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| And so it ends up being a better project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5519)|
| 1:32:06| if it looks like a building with windows and doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| and that's what CG2 does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| And CG1 doesn't, and we have no plans to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| So we don't know what is gonna end up on the site with CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| It's any and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| Which is why, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| You mentioned you were at the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| for the one bedroom senior apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| Well, I wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| I think it was brought to an ice cream social event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| at the park after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| and I watched it recently, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| We had renderings at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| but the town hall, at least the members of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| found the drawings were about 50% completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5574)|
| 1:33:01| As Ms. Testament said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| it gets expensive to have preliminary drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| But having said all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| the neighborhood was quite fond of what I was gonna do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| with a 67-year-old hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| as far as implementing the mid-modern architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| the theme, what have you, I can assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| And you're aware of the past condemned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| and blighted residential buildings that we've won| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| Knox Heritage Fantastic 15 awards on and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| So I'll put design guidelines via the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| and town hall, at least on myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| because like I said, at every turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| I've met with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| and I intend to do so with this project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| I've owned it four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| and I won't do anything different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| that I'll try to make the neighborhood as proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| as I would be living next to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| So when do you anticipate having plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| The deadline for the bond issue with THDA is January 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5644)|
| 1:34:13| And so when I submit the requirement for the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5653)|
| 1:34:20| basically, I'll have to have plans 90 days from then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| about permittable plans or a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| about permittable plans or a letter from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| saying that I'm within 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| on being able to pull permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| So 90 days from January the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| 90 days afterwards, that's what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| Yes, yes, because of the THDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| I think they opened up the bond year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| starts around January the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| So, and are there other apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| I know you've done single family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| Is there, are there other apartments that you've done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| No, I've done the industrial warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| the new build on the warehouse and some mixed use retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| But as far as apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| this will be my first apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| But I might add, as far as my team goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| they've done several merit construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| will be my general contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| and partners will be my construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| And they've had several apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| under their belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| And so just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| you are not interested in the standards that are in CG2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| Well, without having access to them right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5742)|
| 1:35:50| probably not interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| Okay, I'll defer to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| Council Member, Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| but she wanted to wait till the final speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| before the vote, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| So Council Member Smith and then Council Member Spivak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| Yeah, just one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| I just want to say I really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| there's a lot of different types of feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| related to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| I just wanted to say that I think the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| that you're proposing conceptually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| is really great for this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| the commercial along the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| and we need more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| As Councilman Ryder mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| the Elmington projects along Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| Southside Flats and Young High Flats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| particularly are comparable to this apartment project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| and this development that you're pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| And they're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| They abut, one of them particularly abuts a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| that and meshes really well with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| And so I think that affordable housing concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| that you're proposing without seeing design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| I think is really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| I do have some caution similar to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| associated with permanently rezoning this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| and what happens if the project falls through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| I know we have landscape standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| associated with these zoning types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| but my main concern is what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| if you don't do the project in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| So I just wanted to kind of tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| that I support what you're doing in concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| and grateful for the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| that you're trying to make in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| Council Member Cugat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| You're still on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| You.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Hello, I'm just talking away without unmuting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| Mr. Lansing, could you, for the record again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| really explain what you mean by income-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| and not project-based so that people actually hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| and understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| You said there was some confusion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| And I know project-based developments are different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| than what it sounds like you're planning to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| which is income-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| So could you explain that a little more clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Yes, Council Member Cugat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| This will be, they call it workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| Basically, it's based on income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| The property management team, they have been trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| and they have their certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| to be able to go through tenant applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Everybody, obviously, being income-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| will be required to have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| And the standards is 60% AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5934)|
| 1:39:01| So once again, without looking at the actual number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| I think that's around 36,500, 36,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| 6,800 maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| So you're talking about nurses, your caregivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| There was some rumor mill even after the webinar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| that this was, the pastor of Chill Highway Hills Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| called me up before the webinar and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| he got anonymous texts that this was gonna be project-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| And he and I have a good rapport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| and I told him absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| Project-based is mostly what KCDC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| Project-based, the voucher, what they call the PBVs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| that goes with the tenant versus an income-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| which is right there on the income basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| the apartment complex itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| A project-based voucher goes with the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| I do think that that gets a little confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| for people who aren't real familiar with all those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| So thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| Thank you, Mr. Lansman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| I just wanna throw out one last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| I just, I do commend you, Mr. Lansman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| as well for those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| that you're looking to partner with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| being partners in merit construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| I do know they do quality projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| I don't think they would put their name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| and stamp a project unless it was high quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| And again, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| hopefully something that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| will be most proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| for your feedback and your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| One thing that I wanna say is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| I have received a broad range of feedback and comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6067)|
| 1:41:14| regarding this project and what people feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| should go in that space, up to and including,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| they've got several people that reached out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| and wanted that to be housing for homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| that they felt that that was a great space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| and a great utilization for that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| because of the access to the bus lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| and to resources, to CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| and also to the post office and the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| which absolutely do we need to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| more housing for homeless, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| However, I do know that Mr. Lansing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| has had this property for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| and his desire has been to do some type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| Originally, we heard that it started out as senior housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| and now is two bedroom that are going to be income based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| more workforce development type housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| which we absolutely have a need for as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| And so I have heard some really good dialogue around CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| I feel like we as a council may need to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| how do we go back and take a closer look at CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| and how it is written and stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| However, that does not fall on Mr. Lansing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| because of the way CG1 is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| That is an option, a viable option for he or anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| and it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| And so at this juncture, I'd like to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| since we have a motion and a second to call for the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| if there's no more discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| Okay, seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| Mr. Johnson, would you please come back to the roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6176)|

| 1:43:28| but I have trouble with the commercial rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| and the permanence of it without seeing any plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| I understand the conflict with our zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| but for this one, I'm going to have to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6217)|

| 1:43:52| Mr. Johnson, what was the final vote, Callie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| The vote was six-three in favor, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| Council Members, do you want to take a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| I think a brief recess of 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| would be consistent with our general health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| So let's reconvene at 7.53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6249)|

| 1:54:12| let you keep voting even if it's after 8 PM. Let's see. All right, council members, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6852)|
| 1:54:42| to keep to our schedule, so I'll go ahead and resume. Next items on our agenda, J, K and L all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6882)|
| 1:54:51| go together, but Mr. Johnson, why don't you go ahead and read J, and then we also have speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6891)|
| 1:54:59| signed up to speak all three items. There's one, two, three, four, five speakers in favor and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6899)|
| 1:55:07| against, and I'm not sure how they divvy up. I mean, the topic is general. Mayor, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6907)|
| 1:55:14| that all the persons who had signed up to speak in favor are present, so it may not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| Okay, well, why don't you go ahead, and if you could read item J for us, please. Yes, ma'am. 12J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6919)|

| 1:55:53| made to approve by Councilmember Singh, seconded by Vice Mayor, Councilmember Fugate. Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6953)|
| 1:56:02| I just want to give a few remarks to your discussion. I'm really excited to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| introduce these next agenda items related to the former Knoxville Center Mall property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| There are a lot of really positive aspects that I want to briefly highlight. First and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| jobs. This rezoning paves the way for hundreds of quality jobs at a fair wage with benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6979)|
| 1:56:25| Creating pathways to good jobs is a priority for my administration. Second, this proposal would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| revitalize an important but deteriorating tract of private property that is ripe for investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6991)|
| 1:56:36| and redevelopment. It's going to be great to see this vacant property come back to life and come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=6996)|
| 1:56:41| back on the tax rolls. Third, community responsiveness. I've been really impressed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| how responsive the applicant has been in listening to the community, making adjustments to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| plans in order to respond to that feedback. Even at this early stage, they are demonstrating what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| it means to be a good partner. Kurt Nelson is on the call here from Hillwood to speak to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| specifics of the proposal. Mr. Nelson, thank you for being here and thank you for making this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| investment in Knoxville. I look forward to seeing this project move forward with council support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| So, council members, there's some people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7029)|
| 1:57:16| We'll take the pro, three pro speakers first. Mr. Johnson, the list I had, Doug Lawyer is signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7036)|
| 1:57:26| up first. Mr. Lawyer, are you on the call? I am. Can you hear me, council? Yeah. If you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| start by stating your name and address for the record, you have up to five minutes. Okay. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| you. My name is Doug Lawyer. I'm vice president of economic development with the Knoxville Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| 17 Market Square, and I really appreciate the opportunity to brief council this evening on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| what we have is an amazing opportunity for redevelopment and economic development project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| for our community. So, in economic development land, projects often come to us under code names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7074)|
| 1:58:02| and this project is no different. This is Project Malibu, which started discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7082)|
| 1:58:08| with us back in May of 2020, and the project has evolved over time, even since we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7088)|
| 1:58:15| discussions. I think what we're looking at here this evening is a potential capital investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| of $30 to $40 million in the creation of at least 370 direct jobs with the end user company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7101)|
| 1:58:31| and then an additional 370 contract positions that would also support this facility. So, a total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7111)|
| 1:58:40| 730 jobs. We're being told that these jobs start at a minimum of $15 an hour. The full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7120)|
| 1:58:47| positions, we are told, would offer full benefits day one when somebody starts working for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7127)|
| 1:58:54| operation. There's also an additional 15 to 20 kind of senior management positions to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7134)|
| 1:59:02| this center, and these wages are in the $60,000 to $80,000 a year range. So, we estimate once this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| facility is up and running at full capacity, an annual net new wages coming to our community of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7148)|
| 1:59:15| approximately $22 million every year. So, the 730 direct jobs, we always look at multipliers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7155)|
| 1:59:24| and indirect jobs that would support this facility. So, for every direct job, we estimate another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7164)|
| 1:59:31| 0.864 jobs would be created in our community, which brings another 630 jobs potential to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7171)|
| 1:59:39| this operation. So, all in, we're at a total of 1,300 direct and indirect jobs with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7179)|
| 1:59:47| I know public transit is important to our community and certainly important to me in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7187)|
| 1:59:55| role as chair of the Knoxville Transit Authority Board, and we have already made introductions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7195)|
| 2:00:02| CATBUS to talk with Hillwood Development about permanently serving this location, we hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7202)|
| 2:00:08| with public transit to help folks get to and from good-paying jobs here at this operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7208)|
| 2:00:15| And then finally, I'll close with saying that the Knoxville Chamber Board of Directors recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7215)|
| 2:00:21| passed a resolution in support of this project unanimously and to help us achieve our mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7221)|
| 2:00:28| as a chamber, which is to drive regional economic prosperity. So, with that, I'll pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| and thank you guys for your time and consideration of this important project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| Thank you, Mr. Lawyer. The next person signed up to speak in favor is Mr. Benjamin Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7241)|

| 2:01:43| the end user, and the neighborhood and the city. We have, as Mr. Lawyer indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7303)|
| 2:01:51| we've been working with people in the city, in the administration since May. I became involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7311)|

| 2:02:50| with him directly. I had a conversation with him this afternoon and we have presented in the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| that I emailed yesterday some revised plans which show a less intensive impact to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7376)|
| 2:03:04| and outline some of the mitigating conditions that we're willing to voluntarily place on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7384)|
| 2:03:11| property via deed restriction and by revised site plan changes. I mean, it started out being two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7391)|
| 2:03:20| buildings, one approximately 298,000 square feet, one being 119,000 square feet, is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7400)|
| 2:03:29| evolved into a single building of 219,000 square feet oriented to where all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7409)|
| 2:03:37| tractor-trailer traffic that would be required for this project would be entering off of North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7417)|

| 2:03:49| The ports to the east and west of the property, if you're looking at the revised site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7429)|
| 2:03:56| that would be for four-axle vehicles only. We are willing to deed restrict a 360-foot buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7436)|
| 2:04:04| zone to where there would be no tractor-trailer parking or any docking in that area. We're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7444)|
| 2:04:13| willing to deed restrict certain uses that are allowed now in the IG zone that we're seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7453)|
| 2:04:21| that would not be allowed in the CR2 zone to minimize any potential impact and concern as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7461)|
| 2:04:27| to what would happen sometime in the future if this use were to change to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7467)|
| 2:04:36| As far as the noise and the light standards, we also are willing to, by deed restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| comply with the residential standards for light and noise, with one exception. I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7483)|
| 2:04:50| a difference in the height of the light poles between industrial and residential, between 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| and 20 feet. We probably would need 20-feet light poles. But other than that, the lighting standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| we're willing to comply with. I've had conversations with Mr. Brown today. I think, you know, he is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7503)|
| 2:05:10| pleased with the changes that we have made. His number one concern, and I completely understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| this, is protecting his investment in his property. At the same time, he understands that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7515)|
| 2:05:22| the mall being closed, being deteriorating, something's going to have to be done with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7522)|
| 2:05:29| property. It's going to have to be demolished, and someone's going to have to come in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| redevelop it. And we are willing to make the investment that Mr. Loyer spoke of into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7532)|
| 2:05:39| development in a way I think is in the best interest of the community and East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| in particular. Mr. Mullins, that's about it for your five minutes, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| It goes by so fast. Thank you. All right. Well, I'm sure you council members could call on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| for further questions as the discussion proceeds. If you want to, is that okay, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7555)|
| 2:06:03| Let's see, who's next? Kurt Nelson. Mr. Nelson, if you could start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7563)|
| 2:06:09| for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes, and all these speakers can be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| for further questions from Council later. Good evening, everybody. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7573)|
| 2:06:19| Yes, we can. Great. So my name is Kurt Nelson. I live at 69 Cherokee Drive in Memphis, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| and as Ben said, I'm with Hillwood, and we are working to get this project developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7586)|
| 2:06:33| I think this is a really good project for the community on many fronts, and Doug and Ben have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| done a good job of kind of explaining what it brings to the community and some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| that we can do to alleviate concerns. We have listened to the neighbors. We tried to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7601)|
| 2:06:47| early and made significant changes. We've worked hard with the city, worked hard with our customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7607)|
| 2:06:53| and our design team to figure out how to accommodate the requests and mitigate the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7613)|
| 2:07:01| from our neighbors, and I think we have a good plan going forward. I will say that I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| the way everybody has worked on this from the city administration side, council side, planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| side, even our neighbors who had concerns. I think everybody has done a really good job of working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| towards a solution, and I say that because it is incredibly complex to get this to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| with four different owners that are at this point willing to sell their parcels on the mall to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7644)|
| 2:07:31| something redeveloped, so I think this is a great opportunity for us to actually execute this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| and I think it's a good plan going forward, so I appreciate your consideration, and I'm happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| answer any questions. Thank you, Mr. Nelson. Council members, there are two other members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| who signed up to speak in favor. I would suggest that you could speak to them if you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7668)|
| 2:07:55| It's Alan Grissom and Kent Manault. There's also one person who signed up to speak against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7675)|
| 2:08:01| Mr. David Brown. David Brown, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7681)|
| 2:08:11| Mr. Johnson, is David Brown on the call, to your knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| Mayor, there's a Brown. He has unmuted himself. Perhaps this is him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| Mr. Brown, can you speak up and see if we can hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7699)|
| 2:08:32| He is unmuted, ma'am. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| Well, Council, why don't Mr. Johnson, maybe you could communicate with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7716)|
| 2:08:43| offline, and if he's able to reconnect to the meeting, we'll give him an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7723)|
| 2:08:49| share his comments to Council, but in the meantime, maybe Council wants to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| and start their discussion. Is that okay, Council? Mayor, I think he may have called. I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| enable a phone caller to speak. Perhaps this is him. Mr. Brown, if you've called, I've enabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7738)|
| 2:09:06| you to speak. You need to hit star six to unmute yourself. I think you've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| Yes. Can you hear me now? Yes, please. Mr. Brown, if you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes to share your comments with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| Yes, ma'am. My name is David Brown, and my address is 2020 Chapman Highway in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| Tennessee, 37920. And I'll tell you, in light of these new developments with this new SALT plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7768)|
| 2:09:37| um, it's alleviated a lot of the problems that I had with the original plan. And so at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| at this point, I'll just reserve, I'll just say no comment and, and, uh, let y'all go ahead. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| not, I'll just, I'll pass on this for right now. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Brown. Uh, Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7789)|

| 2:10:07| already got a motion and a second to approve this, um, item and the preceding, uh, items. Um, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201103?start=7807)|
