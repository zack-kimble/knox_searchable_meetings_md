| 0:06:44| And what we're doing is inviting the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| to come if you're not a part of Neighborhood Watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| or a neighborhood organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| If you'd like to get involved, to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| and to interact with the folks in these neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| associations and then also for an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| to meet the command staff at the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| and several other initiatives we have on the Citizen Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Academy, the Alumni Association, our volunteers in policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| So basically, a community event to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| how you can get more involved in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| And of course, we will invite council to attend as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| And again, it's June 7th at the Knoxville Expo Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| 5441 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Seeing no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Ms. Mitchell, I guess we can go to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=456)|

| 0:07:50| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=471)|

| 0:08:01| And moved and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Mayor, I have a question after we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=489)|
| 0:08:09| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=492)|
| 0:08:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=492)|
| 0:08:12| Is there anyone here could tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| if there are any other city vacancies on this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=504)|
| 0:08:24| Are we current with our appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| I had a question from someone about that earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| and I wasn't sure the answer, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| thought I would bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| It has not been on the list we've looked at recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| And do I understand, Mr. Mayor, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| is a replacement of someone who stepped down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| 9A is an ordinance amending the Knoxville City Code Chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| 13, Article 1, Subsection 13-2, 3, 14, 15, 16, and 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| and adding a new section relating to recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| And moved and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=542)|
| 0:09:02| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| And so audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Yes, sir, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| I've intended to ask if there is no objection to move 11-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Of course, this is the pension task force committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| so I just wanted to hear what you had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| You want to make a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=568)|
| 0:09:28| I guess we'll have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Did you second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| That's me, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Been moved and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| So audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| All right, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| 11-0 is a resolution creating and appointing a special pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| task force to review, analyze, and evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| the sustainability of the current city pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| and, if necessary, to offer advice and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| to city council pertaining to maintaining or enhancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| the long-term viability and sustainability of that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| Councilman Del Valle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| In reading over this resolution, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| like the wording of it and the purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| but I did not see in the actual resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| a deadline for this committee to report back, or task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| to report back to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| And I suggest that, with a deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| people kind of gear up and focus and know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| that they have to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| And so I'd like to see us pick a deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| and I'd like to see us pick a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| And I don't know if there's a magic date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| but I'll suggest September 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| It could be later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| It could be earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| But I think we ought to have a deadline so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| that they can proceed in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| gets the issue in front of this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| and we can be looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| And we could add a section after section three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| that says something like, we'll talk about the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| but the task force shall report back to the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| with its findings and recommendations on or before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| blank, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| But I think that that would be helpful as a focal point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=667)|
| 0:11:07| And thank you, Councilman DeLavalle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| I am not supportive of a deadline for this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| to complete its findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Task force have a life that, typically when you're on one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| does not exceed the amount of time you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| I served on a task force earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| And believe me, we knew when it was past time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| for it to have the work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| So I have confidence in the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| who are going to be on this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| that they understand that this isn't a task force that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| lasts the rest of their lives and that they become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| part of the retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| So consequently, I would not be supportive of an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| or a movement to put a deadline on the completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| of their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Vice Mayor Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| I have a few other comments, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| would like to respond to Councilman DelVolpe's remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| and also just echo what Councilman Palmer, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| And that is that I believe that the task force should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| take the adequate amount of time they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| deem necessary to fulfill their task here at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| And just to go back a little bit, when Mayor Haslam left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| and saw the need for this, his recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| was that during the mayoral election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| and the current council races that this task force would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| convene, and by the time the new mayor was sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| and the new council was sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| it would be presented to them as, well, it could be nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| but maybe as a report or as with recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| Now, having said that, the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| that I've asked to move it to the front of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| is because we have the several members of our task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| with us, including the two co-chairs, Denise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| Moretz and Bob Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| And they're with us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| And we really appreciate all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| that you've taken thus far in working with Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| on assembling this group, which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| is just a blue ribbon panel and will serve this issue very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=798)|
| 0:13:18| And so thank you for all your work so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| and thank you on behalf of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| If this passes in advance of all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| you're about to do, to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| And we look forward to your findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| and I hope that the council will support this resolution as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| I think we've got a great group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Of course, any of the issues, timing, deadlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| what have you, whatever the wish of the council is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| but I've looked at this and worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| with the administration and Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| that they really need to go about this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| and come to some findings and conclusions, recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| when the timing's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| So I look forward to the council's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| but I'm going to make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Let me recognize Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| I just wanted, before we get into further debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| I just wanted to point out that Vanita Basaria is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Mr. Basaria, if you'd stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Mr. Cross, if you'd stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| And Ms. Moretz, if you'd stand up and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Not everybody here knows you, so I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| like for you to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| And thank you for your agreement to serve on this task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| and we appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Let me also say that I would also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| like to ask the employee groups if they could submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| their committee member to the council office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| hopefully in the next week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| And if it's the wish of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| we'll put that into a resolution and fully put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| this committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| So I know there are some members of the employee group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| out there, but we look forward to a great effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| on behalf of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Mr. Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Yes, thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| I appreciate the effort that's gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| I commend everyone's work to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| and I think you've got a blue ribbon panel as well pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| some more additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| And just out of curiosity, I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| know if it would maybe help if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| would be periodic times where they could just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| come and give a report and a progress report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| if nothing else, just to maybe put that in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| I don't know if that kind of makes it doesn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| speed it up, but it certainly gives the council a good sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| of where the progress is being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| and if they've got questions of us or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| So I don't know if it would be appropriate to say every 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| days or 60 days to perhaps just have a progress report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Maybe that was going to already be done anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| But just to throw that out to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| to start a little conversation about that as well, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| And I meant to ask Mr. Swanson if you have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| And I hear, again, I want to appreciate all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| You've done more than anybody, and thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| But, Deb, I forgot to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| But I've simply done as I was directed, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| by the vice mayor, you by your colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| I really don't have anything else to add other than that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| think we took a great deal of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| in putting together the composition of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| to invite persons to serve on this task force who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| bring something special to the process, who have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| to offer to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| It truly is what you would refer to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| as a blue-ribbon committee or a blue-ribbon task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| If you look at the qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| of the proposed membership, it's frankly incredible to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| that folks with this degree of talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| and these folks who are so busy have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| agreed to perform this civic responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| And in talking with them, I know that each and every one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| takes very seriously their commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| to look at this objectively, fairly, thoroughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1033)|
| 0:17:21| to analyze it, and to provide you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| the benefit of their experience and expertise to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| that that is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| They have also expressed to me their intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| to move forward in a very deliberate fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| I think they would like to get this work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| In my view, the work takes however long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| the work takes to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| You do have, I think it is important to take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| that you have a number of folks on this commission who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| have other things to do as well, have many other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| to do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| And so scheduling with any type of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| is a problem, but particularly with a commission of this sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| you're going to have to recognize that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| going to be some times when scheduling is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| I have every confidence that the co-chairs of this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| do not intend to let it sit on the back burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| They intend to move forward with as much speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| and with as much accuracy and with as much expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1106)|
| 0:18:26| But it's going to take them a while to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| And so my recommendation to council, to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| that you're interested in my recommendation, which you may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| be, is that you allow them to do their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| and to do their job correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| And I think you'll be proud of the result if you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| I do resonate with Councilman De La Lopez's notion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| but I also hear Councilman Bailey said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| that there is an implied deadline because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| want the incoming mayor to have our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| Would the two chairs be willing to come forward and say hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| And I'd like to have a, if you could introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1147)|
| 0:19:16| Denise Moretz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Bob Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| Could you tell me what your philosophy of convening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| this kind of a task force is going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| And is it your understanding that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| are going to provide some feedback or a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| or some recommendation before the new mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| Certainly we want to get started as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| as soon as all the members of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| are approved and the employee and retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| representatives get appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| As far as reporting back on any sort of periodic basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| that's not something that we, as a task force, have discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Certainly we'd be willing to do that based on Council's wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| And you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| I would concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Just candidly, we work, sir, with your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| To get this done within three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| is going to be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| It's a super group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| I'm thrilled that we've been able to put this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| At the same time, there's some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| of education with respect to pension systems, even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| So I think it's going to be challenging to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| completed, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| I think ongoing or updates on an occasional basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Very supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Barbara, in your seat, I would request and want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| So I think that'd be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Well, thank you for coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| And thank you very much for your willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| to serve as co-chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| So good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Councilman De La Voca?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Before you leave the podium, if you could come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Would it be possible for your early order of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| to set sort of a schedule once you got your team together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1272)|
| 0:21:12| The one thing that I fear, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| think that you will fall into this trap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| is that it just seems like tasks fill up the time you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| And there's a danger this stretches out without end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| Maybe some people in the group itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| might not even want to see a conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| So in a sense, a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| And obviously, 90 days is too short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| but a deadline is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| But maybe setting your own schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| is something you'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| But if you could do that and then maybe have an interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| report, that would be a good thing, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| to show that we're making progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| and that you have a tool in your kit bag to say, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| we have to meet and resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Here's where we're going, and you progress along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Because human nature tends to backslide a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| So what do you say to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Setting your own schedule and maybe one interim report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| Well, certainly without having met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| with the group and the task force, speaking for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| I am not a pension expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| I can't tell you as we stand here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| how long it's going to take me and the rest of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| to get up to speed on where we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| to be to be able to provide the guidance that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| been requested to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Certainly, scheduling is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| one of our first orders of business as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| And we're volunteers, so we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| to want to get this done in as efficient a manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| as we can do it and move the process along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| I would concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I very much get the task done and complete it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| on a timely basis, so very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| You're the actuary in the group, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Do you have a sense of timing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| You said three months was too short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| given the learning curve and the getting people together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| Do you have a sense of what it would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| I would say I'm very respectful of the other members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1398)|
| 0:23:18| Again, I'm just one individual having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| worked on similar projects, I think, three to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| I know that's a very broad period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| but I think that's a reasonable period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| again, to Diane's comments, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| upon the schedules of the various individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| in the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| And again, giving due respect to input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| from the committee members and the viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| that those individuals have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| Using my crude finger calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| that would be on or before November 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| if that's three to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Does that sound like a time frame you can live with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| Well, I think as far as setting a specific time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| without the group having met, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| going to be a little bit difficult for the two of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| of the task force to commit to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| But certainly, we're going to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Let me say, I think that we should allow the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| to at least meet prior to setting sometime a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| element, at least let them meet and talk to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1469)|
| 0:24:29| That's my comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| And I want to thank both of you and everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| who's on it for your willingness to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| and your civic participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| I concur with your thoughts about letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| the group not be pushed into a deadline or a schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| We have about seven or eight months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| until we have a new mayor and a new council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| And once again, I want to repeat that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| you're on a task force, you know that you have a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| and you really don't want to spend your whole life doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| So I have every confidence in the selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| of these people who are on this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| that they will move forward and get the job done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| without council micromanaging it by putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| some kind of a schedule on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Obviously, to have some updates are always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| But I am not comfortable with trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| to press people for a schedule tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| when the full task force is not together and has not yet met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you, Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Councilman Avalos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| And I concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| I'm not pushing for any type of a time frame whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| And, you know, if it's January or whatever it is, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| But I think it's good public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| And I think I heard right from both co-chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| that a periodic update, if nothing else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| just for the general public that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| perhaps just can't keep up, but they watch council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| And I don't think that that's too restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| I think it's very healthy for people to come down every 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| days and just say, this is where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Because, you know, I don't want to tell my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| that I have no idea, you know, because I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| going to be able to attend their meetings and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| So I don't think it's unreasonable to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| a public report every 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| And there's been, if I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| there's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| But I want to move to amend it to where from the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| that they convene that every 60 days that they will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| to council and give a report, just a status report as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| to where the committee is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| I'll second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| And that gives them the leeway to meet and kind of set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| their own schedules, but to keep both the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| and the public in the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Because otherwise, it looks like it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| deferred without a future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| The amendment we will do first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| That's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1623)|
| 0:27:03| Mayor, I don't think that that would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| So we'll make sure that we get some type of report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| back to council on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| You have this motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| We're going to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1641)|
| 0:27:21| Your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| This is the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| We're voting on the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| You want to restate it and make it clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1653)|
| 0:27:33| From the day that the committee convenes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| that from that point forward, every 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| that they will come and give a progress report just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| to where the committee's standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Just a progress report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I don't know how to state it other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Mayor, I just want to say, I think we're OK with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Well, it's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1681)|
| 0:28:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Now we need to vote on the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| itself as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| Will entertain a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1699)|
| 0:28:19| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1702)|

| 0:29:17| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| With Council's pleasure, I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| to discuss 9D and 9E together, since they're related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| 9D, of course, is the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| and 9E is the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| And Mr. Kyle, who made this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| is he here this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| I don't know that he was here on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| When we discussed this on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| I had not had the opportunity to drive by the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| on Texas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| But when I looked at the maps today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| and saw that, particularly on 9E, what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| is a rezoning from residential to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| in the middle of a strip of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| that it's all residential, looking at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| I had some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| If you look at your map in 9E, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| see in the middle of a completely residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| and very near to our Lonsdale Homes area managed by KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| it's a single property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| And it felt on the map like spot rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| so I went out and looked at it to see what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Drove up and down Texas Avenue several times today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and noticed a couple of things that I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| to bring to council's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| I'd like to call on Chief Roush, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| apologize because I didn't call him earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| to ask him about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| But I have some concerns about this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| and how it's transitioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| And in making some telephone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| I understand that there were some studies about this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| looking at perhaps where commercial could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| concentrated and where our investment in residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| And I have a couple people I'd like to call on and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| probably make some further comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Mr. Nance, you're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Would you mind coming up and addressing this a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| KCDC has made some significant investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| in many of our housing communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| to rehabilitate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| And if you could talk to us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| about the investment that KCDC has made in Lonsdale Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| and your future hopes in terms of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| along this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| A couple of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| First of all, Alvin Nance, 1735 Woodhaven Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Executive Director of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| And speaking with Councilman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| one of things I shared with her was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| as we worked on the redevelopment of Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Homes and making that initial investment back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| in that community, you may recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| we spent close to $22 million in redoing Lonsdale Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| Also, we were charged with assisting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| the City of Knox's Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| with the commercial development that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| was initially proposed for the corner of Texas Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| and Sherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| That was a location directly adjacent to our public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| That was about a $1.2 million budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| that we had available to develop commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| within that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| We began to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| We thought that the location directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| on top of the public housing site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| was not the right location for the commercial piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| particularly while we were in the process of continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| to acquire residential lots that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| located on that side of the street of Texas and Sherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| We decided at that point to contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| to do a market study to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| where is the most feasible location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| to develop commercial activity within this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| That report came back to us and indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| that it would be better if the commercial development appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| either on the Texas Avenue end where Western Avenue begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| or on the high school end where I-275 was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| So through that process and through community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| that we held at Friendship Baptist Church there on Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| it was decided that we would move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| with seeking proposals to develop that commercial site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| out near the high school I-275 area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| As I share with Council Member Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| we are pleased to know that Mr. Cowell is interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| in investing back into this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| We like that idea, but we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| concerned about his long-term success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| at this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| And if we are trying to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| the concentration of commercial activity in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| where they're going to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| I tend to think that he would be better served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| to be in that location than to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| to establish commercial area in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| where we're going to be developing residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Mr. Nances, is it my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| that KCDC is continuing to acquire property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| to help to assist with residential redevelopment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| We are acquiring property along Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| down to the Stonewall area on the eastern side of Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| One of the things I noticed today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| when I drove along Texas Avenue is that it's residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| as you can see on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| This particular piece of property is currently vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| And I wish Mr. Kyle were here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| to address his proposal, because frequently when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| we talk about zoning, what we see on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| can be a very positive proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| In this case, he's proposing a barbershop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| on the ground floor and office space up above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| But as we all know, the base zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| goes with the property, whether the barbershop is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| in five years or 10 years or 15 years or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| And I remember well when this council looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| at a proposal across from West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| along the Sutherland corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| And there was a blighted piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| And we had an applicant who wanted to do a garden store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| And it required outdoor display of merchandise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| to set out the plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| And ultimately, council decided to turn down that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| because that particular zone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| allowed for outdoor display of merchandise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| would have eventually allowed used car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| sales or a number of other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| that there was concern that that particular zone wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| going to be most complementary for that redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| So my concern is not about Mr. Kyle and his proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| for the barbershop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| But long term, do we want to knock out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| the front tooth of a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| by allowing commercial right in the middle that may or may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| be an addition to the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| I mean, it may create reinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| But on the other hand, we're inviting in commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| to an area where I'm not sure the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| process has supported that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| My question for Chief Roush, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| don't know how familiar you are with this, chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| But as I drove down that strip, obviously there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| a neighborhood commercial right at the corner of Stonewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| and Texas that's kind of a convenience store that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| appears to sell convenience items like lottery tickets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| and beer and cigarettes and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| There's an empty retail establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| of some kind in that block between Sherman and Stonewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| that's now closed, that's now shuttered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| And I wondered if you recalled why that was closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| and if KPD has had any interaction that you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| be able to speak to in this forum in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| of the history in that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| I'm not exactly sure which business is closed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| It's been a few days since I've been over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| in the Lonsdale community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| But I'm familiar with the history of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| And of course, the work that Alvin and his folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| have done in changing the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| has been very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| We have had issues with some of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Now, the one I think you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| of that was a hot spot of some criminal activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| and we had a lot of focus on that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| If that's the location you're speaking of that's closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| then I'm very familiar with the issues we had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| And it was everything from an open-air drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| market in the parking lot to some problems happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| inside the business as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| And those are issues we combat and fight all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| When you have this kind of a setup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| where it's that close to the lower-income residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| they tend to magnetize to parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| And so that specific spot that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| talking of that I think you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| is a spot that we had a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| It's right across the street from this vacant lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| that the request for the resenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| And again, I wish Mr. Kyle were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| and we may want to consider a postponement at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| to talk to him further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| I think the barbershop might be a great enhancement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| but my concern is opening that door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| to commercial along this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| And I know I've been a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| I'd like to ask Ms. Wade if she has any recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| I understand from Mr. Nance that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| were some discussions at the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| there that engaged the neighborhood with their hopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| for this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| And I just wondered if you had anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| to add before I proceed to my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| I do know that at one point, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| was the area adjacent to this lot, which is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| zoned for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| It was the area that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| wanted to see some commercial development back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| in the early days of the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| And through discussion and over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| I think since the RFP that went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| for redevelopment of that area did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| produce any developer, the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| convened again through several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| And through a market study, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| determined that most likely development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| would be more successful at either end of Texas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| So although this area was seen originally by the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| as a place for neighborhood commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| it really turned out to be more successful over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| by High School Avenue, where the empowerment zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| funds have been invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| I'll let my colleagues weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Yes, that's, of course, in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| And I've been by that property over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| and it's a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Most of it is actually vacant lots, several in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| And overgrown, there's maybe a couple of residences there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| that are not particularly well kept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| And then there's a store, as Ms. Roddy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| there on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| I think something we can all agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| is that the area could use some help of some kind, whichever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| I think the question is just some consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| about how we approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| And I'm keeping a very open mind on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| It seems like what I may be hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| is KCDC and community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| may have maybe different attitudes about what to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| What I'm hearing, it seems like KCDC is more favorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| toward more of a commercial development there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| which is consistent with this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| but that it may be conflicting with KCDC's plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Are you in agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| I'm in agreement with development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| You want to come down, Mr. Nance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| I think Ms. Wade and I are in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| with the redevelopment of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| We're still looking to develop that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| and working within that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| My comment a moment ago was that as we continued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| as Ms. Wade said, as years and time passed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| yes, the community initially wanted something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| at that particular location right at the adjacent corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2432)|
| 0:40:32| But as we went through a marketing study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| to determine where is the most feasible location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| for development to succeed, that report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| came back to indicate those locations were more prominent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| And through that public process of making certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| that the community was aware, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| we went out and sought proposals for those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| So I don't think we're a counter to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| in the development of the community, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| We would love to see commercial development in the Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| community, but we also would love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| to see commercial development happening in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| where it could be sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| But just, I guess, just to get straight to the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| do you have an opinion on this particular parcel of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| whether it would be favorable to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| to rezone it to allow Mr. Cowell to have a barbershop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| with an office above?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Or would you think we should not rezone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| and keep it residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| I'm just looking for some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Well, and I hear clearly what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| And I think the answer that I offer to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| is, again, if we're looking for long-term success for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Cowell and that community, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| got a market study that indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| there are some areas more suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| for commercial development than the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| that he is presently looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| With him being directly across the street from the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| that Ms. Roddy has spoken to, and that Chief Rouse has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| mentioned, this is very close to the original site that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| was being looked at for the empowerment zone development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| So I think with that short distance from that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| I would anticipate that he may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| some of the same challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| But again, as we continue to develop residential housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| along that particular stretch of Texas Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| I think it's better if we can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| to develop residential housing in that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| and bring more households in to support commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| Ms. Wade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Right now, our primary residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| that we're doing through acquiring vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| and selling those to homemakers is in another area of Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| where we've found houses sell a little more easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Habitat builds houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| We've had some of our community housing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| organizations build and sell some houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| Right now, just about that whole block is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| We don't really see anybody coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| wanting to develop this other than Mr. Kyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| I mean, this is his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| He brought this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| He owns the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| This is something he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| It is adjacent to a commercially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| That's right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| We do not oppose his development of this barbershop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| And like I said, he is the only person right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| with any interest in developing that property right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| along Texas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Councilman, let me ask you, have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| heard any feedback from the neighborhood residents on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| That's one reason why I went ahead and moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| to approve it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| And there was no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| And it was offered as a favorable thing for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| So I personally haven't heard anything negative at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| I guess I'm a little confused because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| went through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| It was approved 14 to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| I don't see any evidence that KCDC opposed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| in front of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| I'm going to ask Mr. Donaldson about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| And the report we have says that KCDC in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| had advertised a request for proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| to implement a project there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| But no developers responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| And this report from MPC is telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| that a mixed use is an appropriate use in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| And that's how they approved it from the looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| of the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Mr. Donaldson, what did you see down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| in MPC that said this was a good idea for this block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| If I might, the current sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| for this area of Lonsdale calls for mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| of low density, medium density, and neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| on 3 quarters of the lots fronting Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| between Sherman and Stonewall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| All of the property on the east side of Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| and half of the property on the west side of Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| are already classified in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| as mixed use and zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| And in fact, had this particular owner owned the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| immediately to the west, he would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| be asking permission for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| He would be pulling a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| There is a provision in the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| that allows what's called a logical extension of a land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| plan designation and zoning when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| there is immediate adjacency to a comparable land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| classification and or zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| That was the basis for the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| And it was approved 14 to nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| I believe it was on our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Well, I'm going to second the motion that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| thought I heard was pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Did you make a motion to approve this or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Actually, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| I wanted to hear input from other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| if there's some hesitation or some basically I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| wanted to fit my motion in with the vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| that the city had of developing that block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| And so I think what I'm hearing is-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Well, I noticed on this form that this man actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| had a request for a postponement so he could sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| and work with Mr. Rogers in community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| And I don't hear anything out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| that says that this is dramatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| opposed to what they're trying to do there, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| is get some life on that block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| So it's a blighted block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| There's nothing going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| I've got a property owner who wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| to take the risk to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| And I don't see any upswell saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| it's going to disrupt anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| I don't have any reason to oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| But I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| I appreciate Councilman Del Vopi's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| I'm sort of in the same line of thinking that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| I did hear Councilman Roddy say that she thought maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| a postponement might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| I did have a phone call today from someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| who wanted to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| And unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to return the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| nor did I go over to the area that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| But I would be in favor of postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| so that we could have a further conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| and get Mr. Kyle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| And I was also trying to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| what took place two weeks ago when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| we passed it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| He wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2850)|
| 0:47:30| I don't recall there was any military discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| No one came to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| I'd like to personally investigate it and even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| make sure Mr. Kyle is here so we can have a discussion with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| Because I think we do need some to turn the lights on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| But if there's a bigger, better plan out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Well, I'd like to ask Mr. Nasket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| if you don't mind coming back, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| to ask you, you have a lot of interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| with the residents in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| And have you gotten much feedback from the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| concerning the particular plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| Concerning this particular plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2894)|
| 0:48:14| You have not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| I want to be really clear about the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Is the issue that how we rezone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| will always go with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| so we don't want to rezone something that possibly should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| remain residential into a different kind of zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| Or is the issue that if this man had this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| one lot over, this wouldn't be an issue before this council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| And I know that we have talked about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| that the zoning goes with the piece of property forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| With that in mind, if the adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| is zoned for something other than residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| and this property down the road is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| successful as the barbershop and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| it would seem that that would be a bigger block of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| that could be available for infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| or some other kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Because I do know that this part of Texas Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| does need some attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| Yes, Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Mr. Donaldson, in looking at this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| this one parcel is very, very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| So it's difficult to see where there is other C1 adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| I know in the notes it indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| that to the north of this property is a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| And it's zoned R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| To the south, it says that there are vacant lots and perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| something that's zoned C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| And I would guess that's the closed market that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| talked about with Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| And then to the east, it's residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| And then to the west is the single property to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| This is in the middle of the block, and it's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| So it's very difficult to tell what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| what when you drive along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| And from this map, I can't ascertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| where there's any other commercial along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| And I understand oftentimes, as Mr. DelaVolpe pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| a recommendation is made because there's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| a contiguous property that's zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| But one missing front tooth along a residential block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| can lead to two, to three, to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| And then pretty soon, you have a transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| that maybe wasn't intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| And I guess I support the idea of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| I think it would be nice for Mr. Kyle to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| But if we do that, I'd like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| a map that's blown up a little larger so that we can see more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| clearly where commercial encroachment has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| happened in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| And again, I want to make very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| I'm not opposed to Mr. Kyle or the idea of a barbershop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| I'm just concerned about the long-term viability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| And I don't think, in this struggling area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| we need another location that primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| trades in commodities that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| supportive of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| Mr. McThomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Yes, I would be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| I wanted to hear from Mr. McThomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| I can talk you through the map that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| associated with item number 9E, which is the zoning case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| The subject property is lot 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Lots 35 through 44 on that same block are all zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| And all of the lots across Texas Avenue from lot 1 to lot 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| plus lots 1 and 2 on the north side of Stonewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| are zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Lots 33 on the west side of Texas through 26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| are zoned R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| So this particular lot, literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| is bounded on one side by residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| and on the other two sides by other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| and across the street by commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| And I'm sorry, Mr. Nance, have any of these lots along Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| been acquired for redevelopment by KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3137)|
| 0:52:27| We've been acquiring lots on Texas and behind Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| So in this section right here that he is looking at on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| we have not acquired any of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| On the north side of Texas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3156)|
| 0:52:36| But you have on the south side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| On the south side, we've acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| on the back side of Texas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| I guess I'll cede to the councilman for this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| but I would support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Yes, a postponement's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| I don't see any reason to rush into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| If we need a little bit more clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| I would like to talk to Mr. Kyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| I got a call in to him this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Unfortunately, I couldn't reach him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| I guess my leaning is if Mr. Kyle wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| to invest in this neighborhood and he comes before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| and asks for it, I would be, unless I hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| some very strong objections, I would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| be inclined to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3193)|
| 0:53:13| But I'm keeping an open mind on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| So I would move to postpone it probably just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| to the next meeting and act on it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Is that both D and E or just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Yes, both D and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Been moved and property second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| So audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3214)|

| 0:53:41| LP, for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| from neighborhood commercial to general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3223)|

| 0:54:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| So audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3242)|

| 0:54:41| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| We have one person signed up to speak to this, Dr. Joseph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| Kendrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| If you would come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| I'm very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| I don't need five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| My name is Joe Kendrick, and I live in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| where this house is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| We live in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| We got enough things that work against us from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| But this house has been empty for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| and we have complained to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| about trying to get the yard cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| The grass is about, I went back today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| and I measured the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| It's about four feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| And it's almost embarrassing for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| to have people to come to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| to visit us because you got to pass this dilapidated property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| Most of us in the neighborhood now are in our golden years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| I don't like the word senior citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| so I say golden years, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Some of us, children are gone, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| thinking about retiring and maybe downsizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| There's no way in the world anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| would come to my neighborhood now, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| to buy my house if they got to pass this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| And we have been in contact with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| on numerous occasions about getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| the grass at least mowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| And sometimes when someone comes out to mow the grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| they have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| And they mow at it because nobody's coming to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| And I don't want to sound negative because I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| generally a negative guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| As a matter of fact, if I weren't afraid that I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| get arrested, I would go cut the darn grass myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| and give the city a reasonable bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| If somebody would say it's OK for me to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| I'd have that grass cut tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| It's very, very ugly to pass that house every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| The door is not locked, and the roof has fallen in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| And what has happened is what was once a decent house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| has become ruined because the water is continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| coming through the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| It has warped the floors in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| And in another year, if it takes the city that long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| to acquire the house and to do something about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| the house will be just bulldozed to the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| because it would be absolutely worthless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Right now, I estimate it's going to take $40,000 or $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| to make the house livable again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| So what I'm asking is that whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| the city has to do to expedite the matter of trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| to get control of the house, to hurry up and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| If not, next thing you might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| to do is get me out of jail for cutting that grass myself, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| That's how I feel about it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| You'll post the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3442)|
| 0:57:22| You'll post the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Thank you, Dr. Kendrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Councilman DelaVolt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Yes, I want to thank Dr. Joe for coming to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| And he has just expressed something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| that I expressed privately to Ms. Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| but I'm going to express it publicly again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| That is, when you read this write-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| this property was condemned since May of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| And here we are six years later still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| struggling with the absentee kind of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| And I think it's time for the city to move on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| And I think the city has to ramp it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| When we have problem houses, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| need to drag down good neighborhoods and good people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| with a problem in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| So I think we should move forward on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| and urge them to acquire by negotiation or condemnation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| as it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3496)|

| 0:59:25| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| But my question was, we're lowering the maximum size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| of the grant we're going after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| I didn't know if Ms. Wade had a comment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| We're going from $3 million to $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Maybe that was just a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| It wasn't a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| HUD issued some guidance very recently, some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| about this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| And because this is the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| that we're applying for this, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| is the maximum we can ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| So this is getting in the right slot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| so we can have our application reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3596)|

| 1:03:53| Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Maybe Mr. Lyons can just tell us briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| what was the idea of not parking on the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| just to have the bikeway safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| It was connected with bikes, with allowing bikes to go on the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| I'll let Mr. Wetzel fill in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| A couple of things, going back to the bikeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| I'm a cheapskate and sometimes I park there, so I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Well, so if you would identify yourself, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Bob Wetzel, Director of Redevelopment, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Councilman DellaVolpe, there was a discussion six months to a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| that in discussion of bikeways in and out of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Hill Avenue was in discussion, Church Avenue was in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| Remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3873)|
| 1:04:33| Church Avenue was right by the transit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| We thought the bikeway might run by the transit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| There were several issues that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| So we decided to put that street into parking, take the bike lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| put that on Hill Avenue, especially since we were developing a new parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| that could take care of the parking that you're taking off the Hill Avenue bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| And that's that section by the sign that says volunteer landing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| the little parking area over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| We've been, that's now the real person, the big first person to get accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| parking to the elevator, so there's accessibility to the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| You know how many spaces you got there at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Right at 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| How many did you have on the bridge, just as a matter of curiosity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3911)|
| 1:05:11| Probably more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Steve might have some idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| I'd say maybe 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Yeah, I'd say 10 or 15 on each side, probably, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Okay, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| I second it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3924)|
| 1:05:24| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3924)|

| 1:05:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3928)|

| 1:06:03| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| I have a question on that, Mr. Wessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| In that area is Austin Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| I might have to ask Mr. Nance, so you can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| What's the long-term plans for the remaining part of Austin Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| that's in that area there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| I'm going to turn that over to Mr. Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| I think he might can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| I thought Bob was going to be my friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| And he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3993)|
| 1:06:33| He pushed me under the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Mayor, long-term plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Well, on a bus route, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| Long-term plans for the Austin site has been is that we took out 200 public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| housing units at that location, and we acquired the property across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| which was known as the former Town View Terrace 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| So we replaced the units we took out with the newer units that we brought in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| Currently, we have about 124 units that are still left down on the Austin site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| Long-term, we would love to see a replacement of those units and find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| another location to bring in a better unit, housing units that we can bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| into our portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| We do not envision rebuilding public housing units back onto this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| but it will be located in the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Would that be a possible HOPE VI type, possibly, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| If we're going to pursue a HOPE VI, which we plan, as well as a choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| neighborhood, we will apply for that at the Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Taylor site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| I was concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Nick, Councilman Delafoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Well, I just want to thank Mr. Nance because he's been part of the engine out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| there trying to get good single-family housing going in that area, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| going to be one of the major boosts to that Magnolia Corridor, and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| what KCDC is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Do you have something else, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| We had Mr. Wessel for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| This is pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| This is the first leg of the Magnolia Corridor, and you're the part closest to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Would you just tell us briefly what this project is going to attempt to do, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| I'll give you a little background on, just very briefly, how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| The Magnolia Corridor plan was adopted in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| One of the recommendations of that plan was we'd create a redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| district and spend some time discussing with KCDC and city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| We looked at how we wanted to structure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| We took areas really one and two of the MPC study, which is closest to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| which fits our strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| We need to develop to the core of the city, develop the downtown, the core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| neighborhoods right around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| That needs to be strong as we move in the other directions, which we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| stuff in all the time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| So we identified study areas one and two, which I think the thing that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| interesting to me, and just I'll mention this here, a lot of the great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| industries in Knoxville were located here at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| One time you had the standard knitting mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| At one time you had the white lily flowers, white lily mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| You had the Lays Market, Lays Processing Facility was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| The old Knoxville Trolley Yards, where Cat now operates, was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| So there's a lot of old industrial uses that were a great part of the late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| 19th, early 20th century in Knoxville that we need to take on and make sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| get good reuses and good street patterns and those things develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| So we're going to be working on all those things as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| Could you make a note to contact the owner of that standard knitting mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| He went to a meeting about several months ago, I guess over by the Park Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4177)|

| 1:09:50| And he was interested in doing some residential, but he really hadn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| coordinated with the city and the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| He and I have talked a couple of times since that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| He's still interested in trying to do some sort of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| The projects he went forward with, the ones that occupied his time the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| couple of months, he's applied to a couple of other cities for that type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| funding he was hoping to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| He certainly was looking forward to getting a redevelopment district because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| a big opportunity here is to create tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| Certainly expect that what we do with standards is key in this entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| It's a large piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| It's adjacent to a residential neighborhood that's doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| And it's less than a mile from downtown and has a chance to put a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| residential units there that kind of supports the economic base that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| building in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| I appreciate that and I appreciate that you're contacting him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| You just answered or you mentioned something I want to ask you about, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| residential part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| Do you envision long-term new residences being built or renovated or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| combination of both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| A combination of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| So I would certainly hope that it would be some of the older industrial sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| would be converted to residential, especially those that are vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| We should tell you in our public meetings that the property owners there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| now that are operating the commercial businesses, they're pretty satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| with the way things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| And there are some pretty good operating commercial businesses in there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| But those are kind of vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| We think some of those could go to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| And certainly there is some land, not a lot, but some land in there that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| be used for new residential, for new construction of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Probably not single-family housing, probably not a lot of that, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| some other type of housing developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| And the mixed-use plan from MPC is, you know, continue to work on a mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| integrated vertical system with commercial on the ground floor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| residential above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Let me just say, when I read about urban renewal plan, I hope that we as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| city will be sensitive because when we had an urban renewal plan in the early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| 60s, it devastated part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| And some businesses and private residences never recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| So I'm hoping that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| I think everybody's cognizant of exactly the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4327)|
| 1:12:07| That never happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4330)|
| 1:12:10| Just wanted to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| I guess we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110531?start=4344)|
