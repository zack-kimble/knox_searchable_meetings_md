| 0:10:06| We just need surrender of the previous beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Do I give that to you guys now or later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| Oh, we got all kinds of lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Yeah, I was just going to ask, is this sort of a continuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| of a new style of the same business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| What is the relationship to Sague 37194?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| I don't know that store, but we just change owners and we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| set the same name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Are you going to change the style of business or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=641)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Yes, Officer Husky and Sergeant Hunter, there is an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| who's not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| What's the status of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| He hasn't been in for fingerprinting, background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| or anything as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Generally, it's a policy of this board to postpone a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| permit until all the managers and owners have been in for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| processing, and particularly since this is the owner of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| business, I would make a motion to postpone hearing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| permit until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| I attended task class and they took my fingerprints for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| background checks and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| So I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Yeah, we've got your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| You're listed on the application as the manager, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| is a Sadiq Gilani?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=690)|
| 0:11:30| That's listed as the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| That person has not been in yet and has to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| He has to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| I was just going to point that out, what the problem was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| and how to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Well, let me ask this, just because this hasn't come up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| maybe some of the newer members may have, you know, questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Would it be appropriate because we do approve a lot of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| subject to final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| I think I'm going to get my answer right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| It seems like it would fall under that same category, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Vice Mayor Becker, I think you can probably shed some light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| I will try and shed some light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| We've had a lot of discussions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| And I think the sense of the previous council, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| it was a good sense, is that task program and this are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| two things that we won't just wait on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| And at some degree, this one especially, it's not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| a yes, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| This is not a black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| There's a chance that something shows up on there that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| absolutely clear, that is something that could go either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=754)|
| 0:12:34| So I don't think in this case, it would be a mistake to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| things go without them being in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| And that's always been our policy on this and generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| the task program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| We want to see that completed before we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| I guess my question would be to Ms. Martin, would there not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| be, I mean, there's a safety net for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| So what would happen if something did show up and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| would the process be then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| If something came across our desk that looked problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| or if the inspectors indicated there was a problem in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| background check, this would come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| We would not release a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| So I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| But we, of course, defer to the board's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| Officer Huskin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Maybe I can help a little bit on the task part is they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| get a certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| So that's a cut and dry deal as to whether they come or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| And they can present that to Ms. Day and she could release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| a permit based on the certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| But the record check could be a little bit more complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| if something comes up, maybe under another section that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| all want to question or something like that, because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| something that you might want to look at actually yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| instead of us, because we would have to do the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| check and get with Ms. Day and let them know that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| good to go or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| But it's probably better if you made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| Councilwoman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Yeah, I was just going to underscore what Officer Huskin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| said, and that is that this board has taken a strong stance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| on the importance of keeping alcohol out of the hands of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| underage and that task program where that education takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| place in terms of responsible serving and also the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| check in case someone does have a conviction for past underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| service, I think is critically important to this board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| our work in terms of trying to address access to alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| for underage in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| Well, I'm sure that this board wants the continuation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| keeping alcohol out of young people's hands, and I can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| where you all are going to on this, and you're right, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| probably, it's not probably, it is a decision that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| make. So there is a motion on the floor and a proper second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| to postpone this for the next regular scheduled beer moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| Okay, that's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| So you understand to come back at the next, to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| get those requirements completed and come back to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| beer board meeting, it will be the second meeting in July, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=913)|
| 0:15:13| Okay, so the only requirements that I need are my dad's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| fingerprints, pretty much, or his background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| The task class also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| For him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=923)|
| 0:15:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=924)|
| 0:15:24| Okay, you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| And it will be July 27th, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| July 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Well, you're looking at a calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| That's the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| July 27th, I believe, is the proper date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| Santa Fe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| Santa Fe restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| They were not here last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Well, we do have administrative hearings, so I'll go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| make the motion that we postpone this until the end of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| Motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=963)|
| 0:16:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| Okay, so let's get into the administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| You all bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| It's been a year or two since I've done this, so we'll kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| work through it together here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| First up is Al's Market, 2900 Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| And I want to go ahead on the front end of this one and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| Mr. Swanson, I want you to please weigh in on this, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| think this one, because there has been two convictions, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| beyond this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Yes, it's my understanding that the permit holder has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| convictions and not simply an employee of the permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| And under our code, a permit holder is not permitted to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| convictions for alcohol-related offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| So this is probably one where you really don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| choice other than to send it on to a suspension or revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1020)|
| 0:17:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| Do you understand what we're talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| Yeah, kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Not exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| Do you want to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Our law requires that a permit holder be a person who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| someone who has not been convicted of any offense related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| to selling alcohol to underage people, a variety of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| alcohol-related offenses within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| Our information that has been furnished to us tells us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| you have two different convictions for furnishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| alcohol to underage persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| And so those convictions would make you a person who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| ineligible to hold a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| As a result of that, what the Beer Board is doing is voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| to send you to a suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| You will hear from the City Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| They will prepare the necessary charges that will be furnished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| to you that will start the process of revoking your permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| because you have these convictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| And so that's what the Beer Board has voted to do, to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| you to that suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Did you vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| No, we haven't voted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Well, we do have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Are there further questions on this action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| If not, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| At the hearing that he's being sent to, that's a different body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| with a hearing officer, I take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| It is a hearing officer that has been appointed by the Beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| Board to hear these types of offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| Do they have authority to deal with the sentencing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| condition it and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| They have the same authority that this Beer Board would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| However, in these circumstances, if those convictions remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| convictions, unless those convictions are in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| overturned in some way, unless those convictions are overturned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| he will be a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| He is legally disqualified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| He is disqualified under a state statute and the city code from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| holding a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I was just going to call on Officer Husky since he attends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| his hearings and takes part in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Is there anything else that you want to add in terms of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| process or how that works for permit holders that we send?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| I mean, in this case, it's kind of cut and dried, but sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| there is some decision making that happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| A lot of times the law department will work out a deal with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| permit holder prior to the hearing, whether it be based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| their history, a five-day suspension and a fine, a 20-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| suspension and a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| So a lot of times it's worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| But, obviously, in this case, we will push with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| department for revocation based on the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| You'll be contacted by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Magnolia Quickmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| Name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| My name is Forrest Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| I'm appearing on behalf of Mr. O'Rourke tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Address is 3039 Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Well, this is their second violation and under our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| then they're to appear before us and kind of plead their case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| if you will, and let us know about the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| surrounding these and what, if anything, that you've done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| prohibit this from occurring in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Rourke could not appear tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| I'm here on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| His wife is, I think, giving birth to a child in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| So he was unable to attend the hearing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| I can, however, report to the board that he has paid the fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| and submitted a revised remedial plan for this board's review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| Unfortunately, I'm not here prepared to go forward with the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| tonight, and I believe Mr. O'Rourke would be the better person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| to be in front of the board to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| We defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| So you're not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| No, that's now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| We've got a Christmas tree here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| So let me start with Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Yeah, I guess two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Do we have the revised plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| I have the one after the first violation, but not one more recent than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| I have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| That's the one from his first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| He submitted a second, a revised remedial plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| That's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Do we have that someplace, if we can do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| I guess my inclination, I think, if somebody is giving birth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| that's probably a legitimate reason to miscourt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| So it's here someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| So I would be willing to consider a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| I will say that given this is one that we got an initial violation back in July of 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1350)|
| 0:22:40| and the plan was to get a scanning machine and then we had one after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| which wasn't even carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| My inclination would be to vote to send it to a revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| I don't know if it wouldn't make sense just to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| It might be a better use of his time just to go straight to there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| but I want to hear what everybody else is thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Not to postpone tonight, but to send this on to the next step would be my inclination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Well, I just wanted to know as well where the revised plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| because I'm always up here to hear, you know, the sincerity and the plans and the proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| and just exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| I don't have a copy of it, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Why not put it at everybody's desk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| It has the agenda and then behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Well, I'll just look for it and turn my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| The new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| The new one or the old one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| All we have is the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| No, and that's a different piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| July 2, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| It's one that has a different cover sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Ms. Wilson just held up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| No, not this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Hold up the cover sheet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Is that this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Yes, that is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Let's let her gather herself here for a second and just take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| We've got plenty of time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Mr. Chairman, while he's looking, I might just add that I think in fairness to the owner-proprietor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| I think we shouldn't send it on until he has a chance to appear and explain his situation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| I think we owe that to him unless he wants to bypass and just go straight to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| But I think if he wants to be heard, we should hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| I think that's both courtesy and maybe even due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| Ms. Wolman-Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Thank you, Chairman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| I respectfully disagree with my colleague in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| What's new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Looking at this situation, I certainly understand that things come up in people's personal lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| However, my opinion is not going to change between now and a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| The reality is we have two sales to underage, only seven months apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| And the most recent sale, the individual was not even carded, which says to me that after the first sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| this situation was not taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| We only seem to have one remedial plan, and that dates back to July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| You know, I don't know what he's done differently as of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| And the fact that we have two cases, seven months apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| and the most recent one, the individual wasn't even carded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| says to me that this business is not taking seriously keeping alcohol out of the hands of underage youth in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| And I can't see anything about those facts changing between now and a month from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Well, I agree with Councilman Della Vopi that I, over the years, have looked forward to hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| and seeing the owner face-to-face and looking in their eyes and seeing their sincerity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| and looking for their plan and seeing what's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Now, I see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| And as well as I look at it, I would have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| So I'm for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| I guess I'm going to make a motion to send it because it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| We have one copy of the revised plan, and I'll just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| In the original plan we got, it's not dated, but this is one after the July conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| It says, you know, I sold, in the second sentence that you're going to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| therefore, in order to prevent further problems, I have purchased a machine to scan IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| And in the revised plan, it says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| recently my business was cited for sale to an underage cadet during his staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| I have bought a verifying machine, which has been placed next to the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| I think this person wrote a plan saying they'd done something and clearly hadn't done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| And that makes no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| So I'm going to make a motion to send this to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| I still have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| And I'm confused because I was looking at the column on this saying disposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| This man has a case pending in Knox County Court, so I don't know that it's resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| We have carded no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I don't know if that, in fact, is an admission on his part or our charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| And I noticed the first charge indicates diversion is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| In my mind, that means that they were going to wipe his slate clean on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| But I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| But, again, I don't think this is clear enough to simply say that he's dropped the ball completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1627)|
| 0:27:15| and needs to go on to the next stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| But I'll abide by whatever you all decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Let me explain briefly the sheet you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| This is what we prepared for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Where it says carded, that is actually whether they looked at our cadet's ID or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| So that part would be factual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| No, they did not look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| So the minor is a cadet going in and seeking to make a purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Now, on the disposition, sometimes these things can drag out for three years if they so choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| So what that is is this case that he was charged with is still pending in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| It's still pending in outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| If you'll look at the second one there from the 2009, it says diversion pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| What that is is if you don't have anything on your criminal record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| for the most part you're eligible for a probation, which is like a diversion, automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| And you'll get that and you'll get a suspension for 11 months and 29 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| Then if you don't get in any more trouble for a year, it will go down as dismissed on cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| That's what you'll see a lot of times, dismissed on court cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| But now he's had another event within that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Well, this is a different person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| It's not the same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Now, if it was the same person, a lot of times they will wipe that diversion off and they'll get two convictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| As in the top one, it says two convictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| In one of those, it was a diversion pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| But once he got the second charge, they went back and revoked that diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| So it's a diversion pending you keep your nose clean for a year or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| So this case could be pending for another year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| It just depends on how quick the court moves with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| Thanks for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Counselor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Officer, is this located across from the auto zone down Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| Is that where that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| This gentleman was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I do not know, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| It's close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| I couldn't tell you exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| I know there are a couple of people around this room who would like to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| And I always try to avoid parliamentary mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| And it feels to me if some people want this fellow to have a hearing, we should talk about the postponement first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1765)|
| 0:29:34| And I might have been a little, although Mr. Swanson, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| because I can see something where somebody voting against the move to a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| and revocation because they want a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| And, in effect, the guy getting off scot-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| And I don't want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| So my inclination pending Mr. Swanson's advice is actually to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| Well, you don't really have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| A motion to postpone is a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| So if someone wants to make a motion to postpone even while another motion is pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| that motion takes priority over any other motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| And, therefore, it doesn't have the effect he was concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| If somebody wants to postpone, we should talk about that first if people seriously want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| I'll make the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| For postponement for the next scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| And the idea is because the prior to Mr. Rourke cannot be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Let's go ahead and do a roll call on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| So the motion is to postpone any action until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1842)|
| 0:30:51| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Chairman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1869)|
| 0:31:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Then we'll postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| So you understood all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| So have your person to be here at the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| That was July 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| I don't have a calendar in front of me, but I believe that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| It will be the second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| So Backdoor Tavern, 4951 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1899)|
| 0:31:52| Barry Cook, 4951 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1912)|
| 0:32:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I think you've been sitting out here and I understand the reason that you're down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| this evening and just wanted to let you plead your case, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| I have a neighborhood tavern, and we did sell to a — not myself, but a girl sold to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1934)|
| 0:32:24| miner, and we're making different deals to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1944)|
| 0:32:34| And what we're going to do, we're making more signs up, wearing ID buttons instead of on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| our pants and our hats and our shirts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| We're writing down the age and expiration dates of — or the age, rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| of being under the age of 21 on our check-in and check-out sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| I'm requiring every employee, every new employee, to go to the task program before they start working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| and every current employee to take a task program every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1988)|
| 0:33:18| Our average clientele is 40 to 45 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| But what we're going to do is we're going to make — it doesn't matter how well we know them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| first or last name, they're required to show an identification that we will check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| I've also acquired cameras in the bar to make sure if any of the employees do not check IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2012)|
| 0:33:42| they will be immediately terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| I had a meeting last night with all of them, and I had all of them sign the piece of paper that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2026)|
| 0:33:54| beer board got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| And I guess that's what I've done so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| If there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| I believe you have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Again, I guess the first question, the second plan, the one you just held up, I don't know that we have that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| Is there a copy of that someplace that we can send around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| If we could do that, that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| The one with the signatures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Well, it's the revised plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| I want to actually ask — I'm going to pass that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Not having read your revised plan, I was very impressed with the plan that you submitted on March 16, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| after the first violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| I like the attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| You're going to stress it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| I like what you just said then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| My concern is that you did all that last year, over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| You started carting more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| You started getting — you got the drug commission involved for advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| And then you had a second violation five months ago, four months ago, and the person wasn't even carted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| Tell me what went wrong with the revised system, because that concerns me greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| It sounds like you're working hard and something still went wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Well, what happened, it was a change of shifts, where you have a person counting the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| and I've revised that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| They're coming in early on a shift, so there's plenty of time before the shift changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| And I'm requiring them all that it doesn't matter who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Every person that comes in and asks for a beer — and that's all I have is beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| I don't have liquor — is required to show an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| I don't care if I know the first name, last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| I just go with them, or they have — they're required to, or they're going to be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| And that's the new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Plus, have cameras to watch them to see if they do do this and make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| Because I'm not — I told them we're a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| We can't put up with it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| If one person does something, we're all out of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| It's just do or die at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| And I've explained to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Councilman Bailyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Yeah, Mr. Cook, you said that your employees are going to come in earlier than before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| because you think the mishap was because they were counting money and probably had a different priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| How much earlier did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| They're required to be in there ten minutes early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| First time I told them what will happen is it will be written up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Second time, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| And they're allowed to call and let us know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| So the other employee is prepared to wait on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| And also, I live close enough to where I can make up the time to be there and make sure everything is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| You say you have age calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| What are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| I have age calendars up in the tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| Plus, I have —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| It tells the date of birth for a person 21 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| And I'm going to —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| I required each employee at the start of the shift to write this number down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2229)|
| 0:37:16| for the required being the age of 21 to write this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| So it will be a reminder of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| Is that what you're talking about on the check-in, check-out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Is that what you said you were writing that down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| And then you said you're going to send all your employees back to the task for another certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| whether it's required or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| Every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Every year in June, I will send —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| But all your current employees are going back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| We can't afford not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| And how are you going to review these cameras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| I mean, are you going to go back after the shifts or —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Randomly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| If I need to, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| And I call my girlfriend, Hawkeye, because no telling when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| she types it right in and she's watching, look at what they're doing, look at this and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| So they'll be reviewed, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| And they know about Hawkeye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Now, did you give us a copy of that revised —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| You did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| I see it here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Not with the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Last night in the meeting, I got signatures from all the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| The text is the same, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| The text is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Of all your employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| You don't have that copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| I've got the copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| This is what you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| And also, these are going up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| That's all I have, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| In your first remedial plan, you mentioned that you consulted the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| Did you consult them this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Not yet, because obviously that didn't do what I have going, but I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| I didn't quite understand what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| You consult them —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| I consulted with them before, and I will consult them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| Obviously, it looks as if it didn't do much good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| I mean, I thought it did, but obviously to one employee for one split second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| So, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| Was that employee that was charged this time, was she employed — it's not the same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| She there then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| The first person is gone, and the second one is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| She's got two kids, and they kind of need employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| And the way unemployment is going, as you all know in this world of today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| we need to keep people working as much as possible, I imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Hi, Mr. Kirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Could you give me the average age of your servers, your help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Are we having young people, older people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Older people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| The average age —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| 30s, 40s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Well, I'm 57, and I'm one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| And then a girl, 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| I'd say it's about 35, and I've only got seven employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| So, this kind of stuff shouldn't be going on at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| And you talked about the incident happening because there was sort of a shift change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| and someone takes the drawer and is counting the money to close out their shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| What does that — how does that put the second person at jeopardy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| I'm not sure I understood the sequence of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| We get a new bank, and we ring out the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| And in the middle of this —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| You have to count for all that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| And count the money, and ring the register out, and get your checking sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| And in the middle of this, excuse me, these people are wanting a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| So, they decide which one's going to go serve the beer, and that's when it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| But a new —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Was there a table with like a mixed group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| It was at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Some were older, and some were younger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| It was at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| It was at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| And there were older people sitting at the bar, and a younger person kind of — you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| see them right to the side, because there's poles there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| So, someone puts a round of beers out, basically, at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| And serves the minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| And serves the minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| And, yeah, that should be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| It is corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| It's been —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| So, it wasn't a situation where a new customer is walking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| You had a group of folks at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| You got a changeover, and the person, as a human, makes an incorrect assumption that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| everyone's already qualified and starts serving and doesn't double-check because it's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| shift and it's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| And that's not what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| What's going to happen is, as soon as a new person comes in —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| They've got to check everyone again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Everyone else again, all the way down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| I was just trying to understand the —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| I appreciate you asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| What are your hours of operation there at the back door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| I'm glad you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| I open at 3 in the afternoon and last calls at 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| And all the containers and people are out by 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| It used to be, when we first got it over 25 years ago, it used to open at 8 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| And I can't see people really needing to drink at 8 in the morning that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| So I chose to open at 3 in the afternoon after people work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| Even though I know there's a fourth shift and some people like to drink after work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| get off at 7 in the morning, but I just —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| Even though I've had a fourth shift before, I don't want to really cater to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2592)|
| 0:43:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| So, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Mr. Cook, obviously the board has some discretion in these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| This case is remarkably similar to the last one in that there was a violation with one employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| and that employee did card but served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| And then a period of time later, in this case a year later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| again a different employee and the employee wasn't carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| And normally in the interest of being consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| I would say that these cases are so similar that this should go on to suspension revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| I have been impressed with the plan that you have presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| and the sincerity with which you have talked about training your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| Mr. Swanson, would you review for us again if a third violation would occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| and it's within a period of three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Within two years, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| It goes automatically to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| So, if another violation occurs within two years from the original date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| which was 2-12-09, so that takes us to 2-12-11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| you won't even come before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| It would go straight to suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| And I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| I'm willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| I just, as I said, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| That's Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| I think I could have said everything you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| And the one thing that feels different is I usually will just make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| on every one where there wasn't carding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| And I guess I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Because at some level, no, I guess I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Because there is a level where you're taking this seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| I see an effort to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| When I asked you the question about what went wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| and what are you doing to deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| you had very specific things about what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| And I'm not exactly happy with where I'm at, but I can live with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| Let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| I mean, earlier, I think you said the job has been in business for 25 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| How many citations have you had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| I really don't know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| I had several, but not, you know, for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| Any citation, believe me, is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| And that's why I've come to put bottoms on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| You know, as far as I'm concerned, if you all weren't even involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| if it happens again, I'm out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| And so are my employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| I mean, I've told them last night it was the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| We're all in this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| It affects every one of our jobs, 100 percent, mine as well as theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| So if one person messes up, we're all out of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| And I don't want to be in business that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| You know, I wish sometimes that when these kind of administrative hearings go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| that your whole team could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I know it's impossible probably to close it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| I think everyone needs to understand the severity and what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| I mean, like you said before, everyone can be out of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| And that has been you and your family's business for, I know, a lot of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| So you've got a lot on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| And a beer license is a privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| It's not a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| So I don't see any more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| And I think that you will walk away from this understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| And I hope you'll convey to your team that it is a privilege and not the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| I certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Thank you for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Teho, as you all saw, turned in their license, and I believe they're going out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2816)|
| 0:47:05| So there will be no further action there, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| And we did have one item left over from the regular part of the beer board agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| So I'll ask if anyone from Santa Fe Restaurant is here this evening to address their beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| Seeing no one at this point, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| Thank you, Chairman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| We have some guests this evening that I'd like to call up to the microphone, with your permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| I got ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| I'll make the motion to postpone to the next regularly scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| And I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| And is there any discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| I'd like to call Heather Sutton and Karen Pershing up to the podium and make some introductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| I know they were here earlier and spoke with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| We have been fortunate as a beer board to work very closely with the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| And you heard Mr. Cook state earlier that he was appreciative of the assistance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| Drug Commission in formulating his remediation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| And wanted to introduce to this board and to the community the new Executive Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| of the Metropolitan Drug Commission, Karen Pershing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| And she can introduce one of her staff members and tell you all a little bit about some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| the things that are currently ongoing at the Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| I appreciate the opportunity to stand before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| I did want to introduce Heather Sutton to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| She's our new Media Relations and Project Director for the Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| I appreciate everything I've heard here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| I can tell you all are really on the access to youth issue, which very much impresses me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| As you know, that's our focus at the Metropolitan Drug Commission is to reduce access to youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| And it's very important, the role that you all play in helping us achieve that as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| So anything that we can do to strengthen our partnership and our relationship with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| please don't hesitate to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| I'm looking forward to working with all of you and as well as the vendors that are out there, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| to help educate any way we can and help reduce access to youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| So thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Ms. Pershing, I believe that when there are violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| the Drug Commission provides materials to those folks who have been charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| Can you talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Yes, we certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| We send out letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| We receive lists from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| And you do do compliance check from our law enforcement folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| We send follow-up letters to those vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| offering our services for consultation as well as materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| And we're happy to sit down with any vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| either on the front end before they even apply for their license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| or if they have a violation, to try to correct those issues and help them with their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| So we will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| And in a larger sense, outside of your work in partnership with the Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| since we have many new members of the Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| could you tell us sort of in general about the mission of the Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| and the kinds of activities that are undertaken community-wide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| We have a coalition of over 70 different organizations in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| that works on both access for youth, reducing access to youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| and also working on adult abuse in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| We do a lot of treatment referrals at the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| because it's important if someone does have a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| that they have access to appropriate treatment services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| But our primary focus is on the youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| and to make sure that youth understand the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| We work especially with high-risk youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| We have a great partnership with the Richard J. Oakley Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| which are teens that have had some difficulties growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| to try to really focus on those higher-risk populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| We also have a Youth Above the Influence group that we work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| with Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| We work with those students to get the message out to their peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| of the dangers of alcohol and other drug abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| And we hope to expand the Yaddy groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| to some other schools as well in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| So we're continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| We mentor other communities to start drug coalitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| anti-drug coalitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Drug coalitions is probably one of the oldest ones in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| so we're very proud of the fact that it's still vibrant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| still moving forward, and still looking at the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| We do a lot of data monitoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| so we have access to a lot of data that shows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| which drugs are prevalent in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| and try to look at ways through our coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| to address those issues and to make the community aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| of what's going on in terms of access as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| Right now, prescription drugs is a huge issue among our youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| so we're looking at different interventions and different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| we can address and educate the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| on reducing access to prescription drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| Let me recognize Councilwoman Roddy in the interest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| We do have agenda review that we probably need to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| and I assume they'll be here at further meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| so we can continue this dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| but I'll recognize Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Thank you. I wanted to thank Ms. Pershing for coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| and as President of the Board of the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| I also wanted to recognize the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| because our partnership with them is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| As Ms. Pershing said, the issue that we're seeing coming down the pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| and really in our community already is prescription drug abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| and the Knoxville Police Department has started an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| where a couple of times a year there's a collection site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| where folks can bring in old prescription drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| that are not being used properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| and so we work together to bring a lot of partnerships to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| And thank you all for being here, and if you want to address us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| at the end of the next Bureau Board, we'll welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Thank you so much. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Vice Mayor Becker? Yeah, agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| We all try and take a little bit of time here to talk about anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| that's going to be postponed or withdrawn for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| My resolution, I think it's 11-D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| I'm going to ask it to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| They're changing the date of it, and they're changing the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| tomorrow morning, so I figure we can wait two weeks to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| I spoke to Councilman Grieve. He will not be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| He has asked that we postpone the sign ordinance question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| He also is comfortable with us talking about the chicken ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| He'll be watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| He will call in if he has things to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| but he doesn't feel well enough to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| And I guess I just want to ask if other people have either agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| they'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| If I could, just from a parliamentary. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| Let me adjourn the Bureau Board. I'm sorry I didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| If we could, there was no other business come before the Bureau Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| I do need to adjourn that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| Hearing nobody else, any other business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| we stand adjourned on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Should I repeat everything I just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| If you would, beginning back at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| Any other items dealing with the agenda that folks want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| I know there's a resolution to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| Anything like that folks want to go over before the meeting starts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| I think we can just, maybe for the ease of getting through the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| consolidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| There's a whole lot of those 202 fund things into one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| action item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| 202 fund things into one acclamation kind of vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| It goes from 12G all the way through S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| We probably should ask Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| we should probably talk about whether we want to do 202s as consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| on a regular basis, which I think we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| but we have to formalize it somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Yes, you'd have to formalize it in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| But tonight, it would certainly be appropriate for somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| on the agenda, to move that those items be included in the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3325)|

| 0:55:31| there may be an extra large number on this particular occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| as the fiscal year is ending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| it's appropriate to deal with it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| It may be that ordinarily there aren't very many of them on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100615?start=3343)|
