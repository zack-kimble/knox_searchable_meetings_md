| 2:31:19| Stand up, please, if you've shown up in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| And also, I wanted to reinforce earlier what I said about the developed areas in this area of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9083)|
| 2:31:33| You see this 18 acres is steeply sloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9093)|
| 2:31:37| It's got a blue line stream that comes through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| If you don't know what a blue line stream is, a blue line stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| one of the criteria for a blue line stream is it has fish in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| and that's why this is a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| It has fish in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9108)|
| 2:31:49| And so there are Knox County regulations and federal regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| the Clean Water Act, that apply to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| And you can't have development within 50 feet of the top of the banks on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| You also have a sewer line that runs through this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9122)|
| 2:32:06| That property, that part of the property, is therefore undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9126)|
| 2:32:10| The slope, Mr. Mays already talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| I'm not going to repeat what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| The other areas that Mr. Seymour talked about, Heritage Lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9135)|
| 2:32:20| it's built out at three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9140)|
| 2:32:26| But Augusta Hills is built out at 1.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9146)|
| 2:32:33| Gettysview South is 1.85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| Now, those are developed properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| We worked with the folks to develop them at that low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9159)|
| 2:32:45| Did you say Heritage Lake was built out at what, three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9165)|
| 2:32:49| 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9169)|
| 2:32:50| That's an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| There's only three per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| It's built out at 3.0 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9174)|
| 2:32:59| Anthem, 1.98 is developed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| Woodland Springs is developed at 1.91 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9183)|
| 2:33:08| And so I wanted to make sure that you understood the work that we've been doing out in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9188)|
| 2:33:14| to keep the density low in spite of the fact that, at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9194)|
| 2:33:18| the rezoning has been up to 3 and 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9198)|
| 2:33:25| With all that in mind, we're asking that you keep this at no greater than 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9205)|
| 2:33:32| I wrote you all letters talking about 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| And, you know, we think 40 to 44 units is appropriate for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| given all the things that Mr. Mays talked about, all the reports that we've given you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| And we would ask for that for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| Arthur or Scott, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| Right now you guys were at six minutes and the opposition's at 19, so we're going to keep them even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9235)|
| 2:34:01| Could I let Mr. McGehee speak just for a second on behalf of the Beal family that owns this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9241)|
| 2:34:16| Members of the commission, my name is Daniel F. McGehee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| I live at 237 Dedrick Avenue here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| I represent the Beals family and the trust that is involved in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9266)|
| 2:34:31| Many, many years ago, Dr. Dan Beals and his wife Donna placed this property in trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9271)|
| 2:34:38| because they knew that at some point after their deaths that it would probably be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9278)|
| 2:34:43| And they also anticipated that it would probably be sold as a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| This is a glorious piece of property in West Knoxville that had a really nice residential home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9288)|
| 2:34:55| The property was appraised by G.T. Ballinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| The price that we have offered this to sell this property now is significantly less than the appraised price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9298)|
| 2:35:07| But we feel like that this is property that needs to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| We have out-of-state owners at this point except for one of the heirs who lives down in Hickson, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9313)|
| 2:35:22| And we are very concerned that if this land continues to lie fallow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9322)|
| 2:35:27| that it just will not be something that we can sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9327)|
| 2:35:32| Mrs. Beals died in 2007, and the property was put on the market in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9332)|
| 2:35:40| We've only had two other people who have considered a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9340)|
| 2:35:44| but the banks were unable to get their financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| And Mr. Mosley is the only person who's been able to get the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9348)|
| 2:35:52| I would also like to assure the members of the commission that there's not a backup plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9352)|
| 2:35:57| We do not have any other contract that is outstanding or anyone who is interested in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9357)|
| 2:36:04| But we feel like that this is an appropriate use of the land, and we would ask for your vote to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9364)|
| 2:36:12| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| Thank you, Mr. McGeehan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| If I may, I'd like to use a few more minutes of my time and then turn it over to Aaron Gray, our engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9380)|
| 2:36:26| First, the way a subdivision under plan residential is developed is, first, you have to have the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9386)|
| 2:36:33| If we don't get the zoning tonight, this ends it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| Second, you do a concept plan, which was submitted to MPC in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9396)|
| 2:36:42| And there was a lot of discussion about it at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9402)|
| 2:36:46| That still doesn't give you the right to turn a spade of dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9406)|
| 2:36:50| At that point, if the concept plan is approved, you go to Knox County Engineering and Knox County Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9410)|
| 2:36:58| which is part of the engineering department, and lay out your plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9418)|
| 2:37:03| They look and, one, do you have site distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| Cindy Pianky, the county's employee, says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| Do you have an adequate stream buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| Leola Camera, who's in charge of that, says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9434)|
| 2:37:18| The detention basins have not been approved yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| We will have to get design approval for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9441)|
| 2:37:24| They are probably going to be relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9444)|
| 2:37:27| Mr. Mays had some criticism of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| But until you have a design plan approved by Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9450)|
| 2:37:36| that complies with all your laws and regulations that you all have enacted over the years, you cannot proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9456)|
| 2:37:44| So that's how it proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| Mr. Mays was criticizing particular parts of the plan which have not been approved, part of which have not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9466)|
| 2:37:52| but the stream protection has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| Yes, you have to lay out 50 feet on either side of the top of the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9476)|
| 2:38:01| but there's more to it than what Mr. Mays says in your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9481)|
| 2:38:05| This time I'd like to turn it over to Aaron Gray, our engineer, and let him speak to some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9485)|
| 2:38:11| By the way, one of those subdivisions that was approved at only two units per acre, Augusta Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9491)|
| 2:38:18| one of the others, does not have sewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9498)|
| 2:38:22| This property has sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9502)|
| 2:38:25| And you know you cannot build over about two units per acre unless you have sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9505)|
| 2:38:31| They're all on septic tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9511)|
| 2:38:37| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9517)|
| 2:38:38| Aaron Gray, 10330 Hardin Valley Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9518)|
| 2:38:44| I guess I wanted to address just a couple of issues that Mr. Mays brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9524)|
| 2:38:49| As far as the slope at the entrance road, it's still within the regulations that MPC says you can apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9529)|
| 2:38:58| You can go up to 15% with variance and recommendation, and we're still within that design range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9538)|
| 2:39:06| As far as the vertical curves, the same thing applies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| The vertical curve that we've got shown at the front entrance is well within the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9549)|
| 2:39:14| So, I mean, you know, it's got slope to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| but you can reference many, many subdivisions all over the county that have the same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9557)|
| 2:39:22| As far as the detention goes, we are still within the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9562)|
| 2:39:27| There's also another detention pond that was kind of off the page on the monitor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9567)|
| 2:39:33| It's going to catch a lot of the water at the front of the site as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| So there will be, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| all the water still has to go through the same treatment train that the county stormwater regulations require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9579)|
| 2:39:44| It will have to meet all those codes, and we're still working through all the final details of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9584)|
| 2:39:49| So we feel pretty confident that that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9589)|
| 2:39:53| As far as the building slopes, the slopes that he had shown on the cross section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| those will have to, you know, still meet the TDEC requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| which goes through the SWIFT review through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9602)|
| 2:40:06| You know, there's obviously many techniques that you can use to maintain and keep your slopes stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9606)|
| 2:40:13| mattings, vegetation, so forth and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| even go so far as benching slopes, things like that, to try to help that situation out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9617)|
| 2:40:22| So as far as site distance goes, we've looked at that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| and there doesn't appear to be any issues that we can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| We've got more than the required amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| So I think in terms of engineering, there are still a few details to work out during the final construction drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| but I think that we can get there, so I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9639)|
| 2:40:45| Dr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| Thank you, Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| When I looked at the drawing that you did, it appears to me that it was just laid out on flat ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9650)|
| 2:40:56| that the topography issues weren't really addressed other than the area about the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9656)|
| 2:41:03| Did you actually do that based on the topography of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| or did you just kind of just say, hey, this is a concept, I'm going to put lots here, here, and here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| We did look at the topography as far as where we laid the entrance road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9672)|
| 2:41:17| The road that runs, I guess, parallel to Moorfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9677)|
| 2:41:23| that road, it goes again into the slope and rides the slope of the ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| that runs up through the back of the property as best as we could get it to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9689)|
| 2:41:34| So there will be grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say that there's not going to be grading involved to get the roads cut in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9695)|
| 2:41:40| to get the lots cut in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9700)|
| 2:41:41| That will certainly need to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| But I think as far as what we've got laid in and how it lays to the site, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9704)|
| 2:41:50| it's probably the best fit for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| So the lots on the southern portion were laid out based on topography?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| Well, they're laid out based on the road is laid out on the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9718)|
| 2:42:04| and then the lots obviously come off of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9724)|
| 2:42:07| But everything on the east side of the road is going to be into the slope just because of how the site sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9727)|
| 2:42:16| There's not really anything you could do, in my opinion, to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9736)|
| 2:42:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9745)|
| 2:42:26| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9746)|
| 2:42:31| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9751)|
| 2:42:32| Just don't count on your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| As we talked a while ago, MPC approved the concept plan seven to six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9757)|
| 2:42:44| but they approved a concept plan that doesn't meet all of the current codes and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9764)|
| 2:42:52| from what I'm hearing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| So how does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| I think we've met all the code requirements that they've asked at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9778)|
| 2:43:03| The drainage details that we have remaining to work out will be permitted through the stormwater department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9783)|
| 2:43:11| But I think in terms of site distance and road slopes and road profiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9791)|
| 2:43:18| I think we've got all that nailed down on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9798)|
| 2:43:22| Well, looking at this and looking at your maps, the movement of that detention pond is not a small matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9802)|
| 2:43:30| You're talking about a major issue there when you look at the slope of all that land around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9810)|
| 2:43:36| That's a major, major change to that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9816)|
| 2:43:43| I guess what I'd like to say is-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| Scott, can you give your name and address for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| Scott Smith, 1476 Lyons Bend Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| The problem is that Mr. Mays may not be as familiar with the process in Knox County for building subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9831)|
| 2:43:59| The rezoning usually is ahead of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9839)|
| 2:44:04| The concept plan is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| It's conceptual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| It's a layout of how the subdivision would look once it goes to design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9847)|
| 2:44:13| What it does is it gives us enough confidence to spend the engineering money to go ahead and engineer the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9853)|
| 2:44:20| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| It goes from concept to Knox County engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| With our engineer and their engineers, they work through the hydrology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| They work through the stream buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| They work through the site distance, the traffic, the road profiles, the grade of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9872)|
| 2:44:37| None of that's really supposed to be done on a concept plan because otherwise what would happen is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9877)|
| 2:44:44| we would spend enormous amounts of money engineering in full a concept plan that may not be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9884)|
| 2:44:50| So it's a step-by-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9890)|
| 2:44:54| The concept plan really you should not and you would not expect to find the final engineered product in a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9894)|
| 2:45:01| Well, I would certainly think, though, that the location of a detention pond would be close to where it should be on the original concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9901)|
| 2:45:09| Well, I guess I don't know that it won't be where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| I don't know that it won't be where it's shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9912)|
| 2:45:15| If the elevations that he was giving us a while ago are correct, it can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9915)|
| 2:45:20| Those elevations have not been shot in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| That's off a KGIS map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| That's why the engineers will look at that stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9925)|
| 2:45:30| See, here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| These concept plans, once we approve this, all we're approving really tonight is the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9931)|
| 2:45:37| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| Zoning and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| We never see the concept plan again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| That all goes back through to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| By one or two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| What I would say is really the fact that the concept plan was submitted early, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9947)|
| 2:45:53| we did that trying to accommodate the Beal family because they're trying to get the property closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9953)|
| 2:45:58| So we were moving quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| Normally you would be voting on a rezoning, but you had two other ones tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| There was concept plans, I think, but you would not have seen a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| It really is better that we submitted this so the neighbors have something to see and complain about or like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9970)|
| 2:46:19| But it's not intended to be a final product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9979)|
| 2:46:24| I realize that, but they ain't making any more ground, and all the flat stuff in Knox County is eaten up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9984)|
| 2:46:32| I went out and took a look at this piece of property, and it is extremely hilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9992)|
| 2:46:39| I mean, I'm not sure that these figures that are on this sheet right here as far as acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9999)|
| 2:46:47| according to the map that Mr. Mays had up a while ago, that you've got really less than five acres of the whole place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10007)|
| 2:47:01| that would be considered above 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10021)|
| 2:47:07| There's got to be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| When I go look at that piece of property, and I've been doing this, I'm not a builder, and I'll be the first to admit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10030)|
| 2:47:16| but I've been doing this kind of stuff for over 40 years, and I know a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| I served time on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10042)|
| 2:47:23| I know a little bit about what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10046)|
| 2:47:27| But it would not be the grade A number one choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| Now, I don't want to get into what we did with the other one over on Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10051)|
| 2:47:35| where we have transfer of development units from one piece down to another piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10055)|
| 2:47:45| That's just not right in my book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| I mean, if you've got five acres there that's above 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10067)|
| 2:47:53| that should not be included in your total density for the two and a half or 2.4 or whatever you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10073)|
| 2:48:00| So I'd like to make that, you know, point up front too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10080)|
| 2:48:04| So what is the minimum that you can live with on this piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10084)|
| 2:48:08| Fifty-seven lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10088)|
| 2:48:14| I mean, I'm not trying to deal or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| I'm just saying we've already offered that to Mr. Klein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| and that would be cutting our request from 3.5 to 3.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10099)|
| 2:48:24| and, you know, that would be the lowest approved density in that area in a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10104)|
| 2:48:32| The lowest density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10112)|
| 2:48:33| Question to the staff, MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| On page, I guess, 6 of 47 on the packet on this, the one that's in our agenda packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10115)|
| 2:48:41| it's a colored map, but it's got, I guess it's the percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10121)|
| 2:48:50| The slope analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| Yes, rezoning slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10132)|
| 2:48:53| If I'm looking at it correctly, there's a little bit of a small percentage of 40 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10133)|
| 2:49:03| and then some acreage of 25 to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| And that's all the untouchable in the hillside and slope and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10147)|
| 2:49:13| Actually, I made some notes on this anticipating this might come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10153)|
| 2:49:16| I can give you the actual numbers if you want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10156)|
| 2:49:21| The non-hillside portion, as shown, is 10.02 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10161)|
| 2:49:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10166)|
| 2:49:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| The 0 to 15 percent at 1.69 acres, that would be included with the non-hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10168)|
| 2:49:36| and the maximum recommended density would be five units per acre for both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10176)|
| 2:49:41| So for 10 acres or 10.02 acres, you'd get 50 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10181)|
| 2:49:47| For the 0 to 15 percent, you'd get 8.5 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10187)|
| 2:49:53| For the 15 to 25 percent, the recommended density is two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10193)|
| 2:49:58| so that comes out to 8.3 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| The amount of acreage at 25 to 40 percent at 1.75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10203)|
| 2:50:11| the recommended density is half a dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| So you'd only get 0.9 units, one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10215)|
| 2:50:19| So what you're saying, based on your calculations of the slope analysis, 66?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10219)|
| 2:50:26| It comes out to 67.8 in terms of, and as I'm sure you're aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10226)|
| 2:50:32| this is a guideline for you to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10232)|
| 2:50:35| I hadn't heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| That's at the max, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| Yeah, that's what I'm just, that's what I wanted to understand that map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10238)|
| 2:50:43| because the one that Mr. Mays showed, showed that there was very little buildable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10243)|
| 2:50:48| And I just wanted to, I'm trying to clarify, and another question, Scott, on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10248)|
| 2:50:57| and I don't know the, one of the maps that Mr. Mays had up, it had the, in the blue line stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10257)|
| 2:51:03| there was lots drawn on the blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| Now those, you can't build on those, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| No, we would not be infringing into the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10269)|
| 2:51:13| And actually, if you look in the packet that Arthur or that Eric handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| I think there's a section right behind Leo La Camera's approval email, it shows the buffered area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10278)|
| 2:51:25| And so we would be able to build between the road and the outermost limit of the buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10285)|
| 2:51:31| but we would not be infringing on the buffer in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| And Leo has looked at this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| We really kind of rushed him on that because it kind of was obvious it was an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10298)|
| 2:51:42| and we asked him to act on it, and he went ahead and told us to work with Aaron,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10302)|
| 2:51:47| and they got it to what he needed to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| Is this the map you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10310)|
| 2:51:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10311)|
| 2:51:52| And so the back of those lots, on the drawing they go all the way to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10312)|
| 2:51:58| the current boundary line, but in reality the back of that lot is half of that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10318)|
| 2:52:03| Yeah, the back of those lots on the opposite side of the creek from our road will be undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10323)|
| 2:52:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| The way they were drawn, it just kind of confused me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10330)|
| 2:52:12| It looked like you were drawing, the lot was inside the blue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| I was just checking to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10335)|
| 2:52:16| No, we will abide by all the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10336)|
| 2:52:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| Mr. Mays, did you want to speak again, or you stood up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| I don't want to ignore you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| No, I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| I understand the process here, and I understand it's not a design exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10348)|
| 2:52:33| and I in no way intended for it to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| My main point here is with the way it is right now, the conceptual design is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10356)|
| 2:52:44| you cannot make a determination that it can accommodate that kind of density of 3.5 on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10364)|
| 2:52:51| The map, I think this is the map that you're showing right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| and that's what I showed in that one where I had the red and the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| Yellow right here is 15% to 25%, which is, that's the area that I showed in the red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10378)|
| 2:53:04| and that's where I was saying that it should be two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10384)|
| 2:53:09| The park, but the creek, and north of the creek is unbuildable because of restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10389)|
| 2:53:16| And then the green area right here, if you wanted, you know, what they were talking about before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10396)|
| 2:53:21| I think for the 0 to 15% slope, they used five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10401)|
| 2:53:27| Well, five units per acre has not been used in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| They've used 3.4 or something like that, I think, down the road from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10409)|
| 2:53:33| So if you put 3.4 in there and you subtracted this area north of the creek out of the blue line stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10413)|
| 2:53:40| then you would come up to the 2.4 units per acre that we came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10420)|
| 2:53:44| So that's where you get the differences between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10424)|
| 2:53:47| Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| Any questions so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| All right. Arthur, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10432)|
| 2:53:53| Do we still have any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| Yeah, we'll accommodate because I think there's one more person that Mr. Temple wanted to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10435)|
| 2:53:59| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10439)|
| 2:54:00| Are you trying to close right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| I'm talking to you, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10443)|
| 2:54:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10444)|
| 2:54:05| Okay. Mr. Temple, do you still want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| Okay. Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10448)|
| 2:54:11| Steve Temple, 9206 Pinebrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10451)|
| 2:54:16| We live in the Pine Springs subdivision, which there's Pine Springs 1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10456)|
| 2:54:21| We're in Pine Springs 2, and I think there's 53 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| And Moorfield is a direct route from our neighborhood, which I don't know how many kids there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10464)|
| 2:54:29| There's 14 elementary children on our street to go to A.L. Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10469)|
| 2:54:34| And if you've been on Moorfield, like I appreciate Mr. Brown going on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| It's a really – I've seen driveways that are a little bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10478)|
| 2:54:42| It's not a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10482)|
| 2:54:43| It's a small road and very hilly, and it's similar to driving up to Cades Cove in the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10483)|
| 2:54:49| It's really hilly and wavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| And it's difficult enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10491)|
| 2:54:58| And so right when Moorfield comes out to Westland, when parents are dropping the kids off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| the road can back up, the traffic can back up almost to Moorfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| In fact, I've seen it to Moorfield talking, I don't know, almost an eighth of a mile from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10507)|
| 2:55:13| So if you put in 57 more or however many more homes on that small road that's probably an eighth of a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10513)|
| 2:55:19| I guess it would be an eighth of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| It's a really small road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10521)|
| 2:55:23| It's going to compound a lot of the traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| And probably you have to – that's the only route for us to go, a logical way to go to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10527)|
| 2:55:32| so I would encourage – we probably have to – I know it's getting up earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10532)|
| 2:55:36| but there's a – traffic's already a major issue there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10536)|
| 2:55:39| which is why they've probably done a lot of work on the exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| So, I mean, I've heard a lot about concepts and regulations and zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| but driving to school, I don't drive with a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| I mean, the traffic's tough enough already, and so it is really – the grade's bad on those hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10550)|
| 2:55:56| and I've seen a lot of the flooding that have had to turn around and go another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| So I can't imagine any grading or any kind of more construction in that development area would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10559)|
| 2:56:08| And I know that – I mean, I know that the 2.4 compared to 3.7 probably is a maximized amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10568)|
| 2:56:17| for the development area, but I think it's still – I think at 2.4 they can still, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10577)|
| 2:56:23| be profitable in building development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| And I think that really the difference here is the number between really if it's dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| versus kind of what's beneficial to the committee or the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| and I think that's why so many of us showed up from the areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| because I feel strongly about the area and how it would affect the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10596)|
| 2:56:40| and affect the school zone and just the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10600)|
| 2:56:43| There's kids that actually are dropped off on Moorfield, so just right up from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10603)|
| 2:56:48| So it definitely affects a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| So I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10611)|
| 2:56:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| Before he walks away, I have a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10614)|
| 2:56:57| And this is another part of it that I wanted to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| I mean, I hear the pros and the cons of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| but I was curious if we'd hear from some of the people that just live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10623)|
| 2:57:08| and want to know about the quality of life, which I think is important to respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10628)|
| 2:57:14| And how long is Moorfield Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| How long is Moorfield Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10638)|
| 2:57:19| I mean, I've driven it, but what is it, two and a half miles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| Oh, no, it's an eighth of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| Is it that far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| Eighth of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10644)|
| 2:57:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10645)|
| 2:57:26| I'm a terrible judge of length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| Eight-tenths of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10647)|
| 2:57:28| Eight-tenths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| I wouldn't say it's an eighth of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| It's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| It's about a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10651)|
| 2:57:32| It's not an eighth of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10652)|
| 2:57:33| Eight-tenths of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| I'm talking about from Westland to Bluegrass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10659)|
| 2:57:40| It's an eighth of a mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10660)|
| 2:57:41| Eight-tenths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10661)|
| 2:57:42| Eight-tenths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10662)|
| 2:57:43| Hey, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10665)|
| 2:57:46| Turn the hearing aid up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10666)|
| 2:57:48| It goes back to once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10669)|
| 2:57:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10670)|
| 2:57:51| We've been here all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| So it seems shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10672)|
| 2:57:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| And I'm glad you clarified that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| How many people live on Moorfield Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10676)|
| 2:57:58| Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10678)|
| 2:57:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10679)|
| 2:58:00| I mean, I know you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10680)|
| 2:58:01| But do we know how many residences there are on Moorfield Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10681)|
| 2:58:06| Does anybody know that fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| I think they're all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| I think they're all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| Well, no, there's a road up there that has several houses off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10692)|
| 2:58:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10696)|
| 2:58:17| So I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| From our neighborhood, there's 53 homes in ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10699)|
| 2:58:24| That's in Pine Springs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| And there's a one and a three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| So there's probably a hundred just in that small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| And that is their main route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| To get to Air Lots, it's either go all the way down, go past Bluegrass School Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10711)|
| 2:58:36| which you would not want to do, drive all the way up Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| and then cut over to Westland, so drive several miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10719)|
| 2:58:42| or go Moorfield, which takes two minutes if you don't hit traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10722)|
| 2:58:46| But we hit traffic, so it takes 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| And so any change in that would be detrimental to the morning route to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10728)|
| 2:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| I just was curious if you had some figures on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10737)|
| 2:59:00| And we've got more people that have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| About 20 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| 20 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10745)|
| 2:59:06| 20 residences all on Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| Adjoin Moorfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10750)|
| 2:59:11| Commissioner Scudamica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10753)|
| 2:59:14| Can I ask you a question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10754)|
| 2:59:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10755)|
| 2:59:16| You said you're from Pine Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10756)|
| 2:59:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| Would you classify your subdivision as somewhat hilly back in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10758)|
| 2:59:22| It is hilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10762)|
| 2:59:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10763)|
| 2:59:24| Did you realize that in your acreage there you have 75 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10764)|
| 2:59:28| and that your density built out is at 1.8 dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10768)|
| 2:59:32| I assumed it was something like that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10774)|
| 2:59:35| And with that kind of slope that you have in Pine Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| And most people don't understand you're directly behind A.L. Lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10780)|
| 2:59:41| You can see where the water tower is at that height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| We're behind A.L. Lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| You can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10786)|
| 2:59:47| We have two boys that are 7'9".| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| If they dig a hole in the yard, it screws up the whole drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| I can't imagine what a development would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10794)|
| 2:59:55| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10795)|
| 2:59:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10796)|
| 2:59:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10797)|
| 2:59:58| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10798)|
| 2:59:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10799)|
| 3:00:00| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| You just need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10801)|
| 3:00:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10802)|
| 3:00:03| Patricia Mayhew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10803)|
| 3:00:04| 1112 Traymore Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10804)|
| 3:00:07| I live in the condo development that is accesses from Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10807)|
| 3:00:13| and our unit directly abuts Moorfield Drive or Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10813)|
| 3:00:19| I have several concerns regarding the process and the development of this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10819)|
| 3:00:25| I am not opposed to it being developed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10825)|
| 3:00:28| But first thing is I want to express concern regarding any changes in the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10828)|
| 3:00:35| when they built the development across the street from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10835)|
| 3:00:41| and also the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| We had drainage issues and flooding at the front of Traymore Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10843)|
| 3:00:49| We have a problem where the blue stream is basically our property line in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10849)|
| 3:00:57| Any changes to the water and the drainage on the back will directly affect those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10857)|
| 3:01:02| condo units that are in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10862)|
| 3:01:05| Those back units were built on fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| So I have some concerns about retention ponds and water drainage coming off of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10869)|
| 3:01:15| The other thing that I have a concern about is the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| Right now, yes, I am directly affected by the traffic that's coming across Moorfield Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10879)|
| 3:01:25| and coming to Westland Drive to turn right or left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| Prior to my retirement, I had to change my work hours in order to be able to turn left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10889)|
| 3:01:34| to get on the Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| Now that I'm retired, I set my schedule so I avoid problems in turning left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10896)|
| 3:01:42| to get on to Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| Sometimes I turn right and then turn into the power station in order to turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10905)|
| 3:01:51| and then go west on Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10911)|
| 3:01:55| There has been nothing to address the traffic problem that is going to be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10915)|
| 3:02:01| by that many units being put on Moorfield when you take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10921)|
| 3:02:07| the addition of 320-some units of apartments across the road on Emory Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10927)|
| 3:02:14| the addition of 60-plus units across from Getty's View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10934)|
| 3:02:20| in addition to other development that is occurring on Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10940)|
| 3:02:25| based upon MPC's calculations of what that's going to do in road trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10945)|
| 3:02:31| It's going to increase traffic on Westland Drive and in front of Traymore Village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| and there is only one entrance and exit, and that's on to Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| It's going to increase that by 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| How am I and my neighbors who are elderly and much older than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10963)|
| 3:02:49| how are we going to be able to get out of our development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10969)|
| 3:02:54| The last point that I have is based upon the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| that we as neighbors to this development have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10979)|
| 3:03:03| I am concerned that we as a community are denuding the land and the beauty that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10983)|
| 3:03:12| that is natural to this area by putting more concrete and more asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10992)|
| 3:03:19| and more homes in areas that are not designed to have housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=10999)|
| 3:03:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11004)|
| 3:03:25| Can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11005)|
| 3:03:26| Is Traymore, am I looking at it right, is that Emory Church directly across from Traymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11006)|
| 3:03:30| Emory Church is directly across, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11010)|
| 3:03:33| Isn't that getting a red light with that new development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11013)|
| 3:03:37| If it's warranted is the phrasing that we have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11017)|
| 3:03:42| There is no timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11022)|
| 3:03:43| Okay, I just thought TDOT said they were going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| There is no timing that has been designed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11025)|
| 3:03:49| And right now is Moorfield is within, Moorfield and the entrance to Traymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11029)|
| 3:03:54| is within 150 feet of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11034)|
| 3:03:58| So we have to deal with traffic that's coming off of Moorfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| traffic that's traveling west on Westland, as well as Emory Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11042)|
| 3:04:06| and the traffic that's coming off of the Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11046)|
| 3:04:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11049)|
| 3:04:10| Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11052)|
| 3:04:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11053)|
| 3:04:17| Just need your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| John Julies, 1307 Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| Mr. Thomas asked about the homeowners and their concerns there about the livelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| or the topography, and I don't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11068)|
| 3:04:31| I know that if it snows tonight, don't come down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11071)|
| 3:04:36| Two days, maybe three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| People park in my driveway, and I sent you all a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11078)|
| 3:04:42| And don't even leave their name of who it is that's in my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11082)|
| 3:04:46| I have to cut through my neighbor's, Kirk Naylor's, backyard to go out his way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11086)|
| 3:04:51| to hit Moorfield and then go to Bluegrass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11091)|
| 3:04:56| That's just living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11099)|
| 3:05:00| I've had people come up to my house with their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| and their cars are stuck out there, so they can get a tow truck to get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11102)|
| 3:05:07| And you're going to add this with more kids and cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| That doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| That's all I've got to say, so I'll leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11114)|
| 3:05:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| Oh, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| My name is Sharon Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11120)|
| 3:05:21| We live at 9520 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11121)|
| 3:05:25| The creek, our driveway crosses the creek from Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| We're on the west side of Tremor is our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11129)|
| 3:05:34| We're concerned about the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11134)|
| 3:05:37| We can see those detention basins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| I don't even think it takes anybody but an amateur can see that they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| in a place to collect water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| This is a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11146)|
| 3:05:47| It's a continuous stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11147)|
| 3:05:51| We don't want to be the detention basin for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| We don't want to have to sue the individual property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| in this development if it's put in, sold to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11158)|
| 3:06:02| and they end up with the decision that's made here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11162)|
| 3:06:10| It's a big, wide valley there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11170)|
| 3:06:12| In a big rain that comes down, suddenly that valley will fill up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11172)|
| 3:06:18| The ditch along Moorfield just handles the water in a normal rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11178)|
| 3:06:23| If you denude that hillside, you put that many houses in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| that will make that whole valley just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11187)|
| 3:06:30| total water in any kind of rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11190)|
| 3:06:33| When Lots Elementary School was built with no detention by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11193)|
| 3:06:37| we had problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11197)|
| 3:06:40| And so this is just a continuation that's directly upstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11200)|
| 3:06:44| and I think we'll have a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| And they won't be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| And Knox County's regulations, even at the best, are minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11208)|
| 3:06:52| They don't put it in a pre-development state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11212)|
| 3:06:55| So I really ask you to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| And the last thing is that planned residential is supposed to be a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11218)|
| 3:07:03| in which you take property and you make the best of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11223)|
| 3:07:09| You don't just destroy the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11229)|
| 3:07:12| You're supposed to, you know, put some density here, some density there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11232)|
| 3:07:16| so you can preserve the trees, so you can preserve the hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11236)|
| 3:07:19| so you can preserve the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| And what you see here is just take a map, draw in as many lots as we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11241)|
| 3:07:26| to make this work, and that's what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11246)|
| 3:07:31| And planned residential and the density that you set should be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11251)|
| 3:07:37| in a positive way, not just density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11257)|
| 3:07:41| It should be used so there's big, large trees can be left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11261)|
| 3:07:46| There's some slopes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11266)|
| 3:07:48| The water's headed adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11268)|
| 3:07:51| That's the kind of thing that we don't see in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11271)|
| 3:07:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11276)|
| 3:07:57| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11277)|
| 3:07:59| This is a question for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| How wide is the road from one end to the other of Moorfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11281)|
| 3:08:05| What's the average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11285)|
| 3:08:06| One end to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11286)|
| 3:08:08| I mean, the width-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11288)|
| 3:08:09| You start on Westland, go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| Is it about 18, 18 and a half feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| 18 to 19 feet, I think, was the estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| I measured four or five different places, and I didn't get anything less than 18 and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11295)|
| 3:08:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| Is the property line from the center of the road to the end of the pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11301)|
| 3:08:26| or is there an easement on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| 25 foot from the middle of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| Usually it's from the center line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| I think the applicant could tell you if there are any easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11318)|
| 3:08:39| 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11319)|
| 3:08:40| 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11320)|
| 3:08:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11321)|
| 3:08:42| So there's 30 feet from the center of the line over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11322)|
| 3:08:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11325)|
| 3:08:46| It's already got an easement on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| Well, it'll be as it's redrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11328)|
| 3:08:50| Whenever he purchases it, he loses that right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| I'm not talking about the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11333)|
| 3:08:54| I'm talking about the road itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11334)|
| 3:08:56| Is it like in my area out here, most of the road in my area is from the center line to the edge of the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11336)|
| 3:09:04| I believe that this is unplanted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11344)|
| 3:09:07| So the right of way, the 30 foot from center line, will actually describe the property boundary as it's platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11347)|
| 3:09:17| Okay, as it's platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11357)|
| 3:09:18| So if anybody else sells property out through there, it will be going up to 30 feet from the center line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11358)|
| 3:09:24| If you replant it or redivide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11364)|
| 3:09:26| Redivide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11366)|
| 3:09:27| If it's already platted, then it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11372)|
| 3:09:33| Now, someone said that there's going to be an improvement or there has been an improvement to the Westland entrance from Moorfield right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11373)|
| 3:09:45| I believe if there is one, it's fairly minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11385)|
| 3:09:49| I don't believe there are any deceleration, acceleration lanes or left turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11389)|
| 3:09:57| The one thing I was going to say is you do note, and this was part of the discussion earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11397)|
| 3:10:03| there will be two intersection signals installed as part of the Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11403)|
| 3:10:10| Pellissippi Parkway improvements being constructed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11410)|
| 3:10:14| And in talking with Knox County Engineering, if warranted, the woman who came up and spoke was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11414)|
| 3:10:21| The next logical candidate would be right out in front of Tremor Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11421)|
| 3:10:26| So you have the possibility of three more intersection signals as traffic continues to grow, which is happening out on Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11426)|
| 3:10:36| Well, the one thing that I'm asking that about, about how things have, I was there when they developed Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11436)|
| 3:10:44| and they were talking about entrances and exits, and finally there were some people who wanted to exit, I guess, on Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11444)|
| 3:10:51| The Westland Drive, when Pellissippi was first started talking about planning, there wasn't supposed to be an exit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11451)|
| 3:10:57| but they got it there for planned development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| And I know the land's going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11460)|
| 3:11:02| I also went to the schools and sat out there during school times, and somebody had this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11462)|
| 3:11:08| but would you have your kids walk that street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11468)|
| 3:11:10| Well, everybody that I saw delivered their kids to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11470)|
| 3:11:17| I even went to my school, which is bricky, which has got a walkway in front of it and a walkway all the way back up to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11477)|
| 3:11:23| and not one person let their kid off on the sidewalk to walk back to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11483)|
| 3:11:28| So that wouldn't be an argument for letting kids out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11488)|
| 3:11:33| And the width of the road, that meets the minimum state requirement for development, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11493)|
| 3:11:39| It's going to be county standard, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| County standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11502)|
| 3:11:43| So that's 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11505)|
| 3:11:46| At this point in time, 18 to 19, I believe that the applicant may be able to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11506)|
| 3:11:52| I'm sorry that I can't answer your question in terms of what types of improvements might have happened right at Moorfield and Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11512)|
| 3:12:00| but the one comment I did want to make is the characterization that we go from zoning to concept plan to design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11520)|
| 3:12:11| to final plaid is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| The design plan is actually the most intensive technical part of the exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11533)|
| 3:12:20| so that would be the point in time where any improvements off-site required of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11540)|
| 3:12:28| or the developer would really take form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11551)|
| 3:12:32| Even at that point when you do the development site, the concept plan and turn it into what's going to really be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11552)|
| 3:12:38| because this is just a concept, but the design plan, what's really going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| it could even reduce the density of the property, could it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11562)|
| 3:12:45| It could significantly change the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11565)|
| 3:12:49| and the extent to which that plan might be altered could force it to go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission for new review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11569)|
| 3:12:58| or it could be altered in a less significant way and be allowed to continue forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11578)|
| 3:13:03| as long as it meets the minimum requirements of Knox County Engineering and your codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11583)|
| 3:13:10| So the engineering department has not given their blessing on anything right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11590)|
| 3:13:14| They have given their blessing on the zoning in terms of not finding adverse impact and also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11594)|
| 3:13:22| and I don't want to even say adverse impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11602)|
| 3:13:26| The statement that we evaluate applicants based on minimum requirements is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11606)|
| 3:13:33| So that is what Knox County Engineering has looked at for both the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11613)|
| 3:13:38| and for the concept plan and use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11618)|
| 3:13:42| The next stage is the design plan, which becomes much more intensive and requires some fairly expensive studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11622)|
| 3:13:51| So the sector plan in that area is, as for density, is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11631)|
| 3:13:57| It's low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| And that goes up to how many units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11639)|
| 3:14:01| In the county, it goes up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| It goes up to five, but we're looking at what the sector plan is that they're asking for there is 3.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11643)|
| 3:14:09| and it could be even less than that if they don't do the engineering, like was told to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11649)|
| 3:14:14| that needs to be done on the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11654)|
| 3:14:17| There is no way they're going to avoid doing the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11657)|
| 3:14:20| They are going to have to meet the minimum requirements that any other applicant would have to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11660)|
| 3:14:25| and that would be during the design plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11665)|
| 3:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11669)|
| 3:14:30| That's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11670)|
| 3:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11671)|
| 3:14:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11672)|
| 3:14:34| I had a question for MPC staff, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| Commissioner Bussler asked about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11677)|
| 3:14:39| I'll ask about the slope ridgetop protection, and does this meet the guidelines set forth by MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11679)|
| 3:14:49| On page 33 of the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11689)|
| 3:14:55| there is an actual table that is what we use to conduct our calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11695)|
| 3:15:03| and we are very careful to give you a number simply because there is a disclaimer in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11703)|
| 3:15:09| and it says it's to be used as a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11709)|
| 3:15:13| It's not adopted by regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| and it's really meant to be kind of a way for the commission to be able to measure this particular proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11715)|
| 3:15:25| up against perhaps any other property that might be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11725)|
| 3:15:29| because we're trying to find a way to consistently apply these guidelines throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11729)|
| 3:15:36| The actual wording, and I'll read it to you if you want me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11736)|
| 3:15:43| says these factors should be considered guidelines to determine an overall recommended residential density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11743)|
| 3:15:49| for requests for changes to the zoning map to planned residential zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11749)|
| 3:15:55| that are considered by MPC prior to being considered by the appropriate legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11755)|
| 3:16:01| The resulting zone district development right would be considered a budget for dwelling units to be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11761)|
| 3:16:08| over the entire proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11768)|
| 3:16:11| So I guess my point is it tells you what you get in terms of a total number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11771)|
| 3:16:18| It does not tell you, and you can go to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11778)|
| 3:16:22| and see how they talk about how those units should be distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11782)|
| 3:16:26| Again, this is all a guideline and all recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11786)|
| 3:16:31| Did I answer your question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to recognize Mr. Luthold to speak for a minute, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11796)|
| 3:16:41| Can he address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11801)|
| 3:16:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11802)|
| 3:16:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11803)|
| 3:16:44| And then I have some follow-up questions for Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11804)|
| 3:16:47| Craig Luthold, 1320 Zachary Taylor Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11807)|
| 3:16:52| I was glad to hear from some of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| I live in Augusta Hills, which was referenced tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11814)|
| 3:16:58| I was glad to hear from some of the other neighbors and the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11818)|
| 3:17:01| I've had a chance to speak to a lot of you about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11821)|
| 3:17:06| and I was glad to hear some of the same folks, my neighbors in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11826)|
| 3:17:10| have echoed some of the same concerns that I echoed to you about the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11830)|
| 3:17:15| about how it's the only connection from Bluegrass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11835)|
| 3:17:18| and how many people use, they live on Bluegrass, all the subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11838)|
| 3:17:22| and there has to be thousands of residents that live along Bluegrass Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11842)|
| 3:17:27| or in subdivisions along there that use Moorfield to get over to Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11847)|
| 3:17:33| so they can access the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11853)|
| 3:17:36| And the bus is having to go up and down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11856)|
| 3:17:41| And the one gentleman here, I'm sorry, I forgot his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| talked about coming from east to get on to Moorfield, to get around to A.L. Lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11864)|
| 3:17:54| I sort of assumed people on the east side of that would have gone around the other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11874)|
| 3:18:00| since I live west of Moorfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| and that just shows me that more people are using this road than I even felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11883)|
| 3:18:09| because I've never been up and down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| I've not either been in a line and hadn't passed a line of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11891)|
| 3:18:15| But I've heard questions and I've heard talk about people talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11895)|
| 3:18:19| there's going to be use on review, it's going to go before engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11899)|
| 3:18:25| This is these citizens' one and only opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11905)|
| 3:18:31| and have their concerns in front of their elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11911)|
| 3:18:35| You are the elected body of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11915)|
| 3:18:38| You get to make a decision tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11918)|
| 3:18:40| You have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11920)|
| 3:18:41| This is your only chance to influence what's going to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11921)|
| 3:18:44| You only get to do it with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11924)|
| 3:18:46| You don't get to impact the plan, the engineering, or how it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11926)|
| 3:18:52| You only get one opportunity to decide the density of the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11932)|
| 3:18:57| It's very important that you use your discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11937)|
| 3:19:02| what you feel is best for this area given all that you've heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11942)|
| 3:19:07| You can go back and forth as to engineering this versus that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11947)|
| 3:19:13| I think what I've heard tonight is that the people that live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11953)|
| 3:19:16| that are going to be impacted most by this other than the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11956)|
| 3:19:22| is that they feel like this is too dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11962)|
| 3:19:25| And we're asking that you use your power, your one vote tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11965)|
| 3:19:31| on this piece of property to alleviate those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11971)|
| 3:19:35| because most of that's going to happen not in front of the TV lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11975)|
| 3:19:41| but behind the doors of an engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11981)|
| 3:19:46| and how they figure with the engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11986)|
| 3:19:49| And it's a little bit awkward tonight because I've got family on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11989)|
| 3:19:53| Aaron Gray is my nephew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11993)|
| 3:19:56| Dan McGee, he's a long-term friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=11996)|
| 3:20:00| But this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12000)|
| 3:20:01| This affects me and these other citizens out here personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12001)|
| 3:20:05| on how it's going to affect their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| So I'm asking you to please think about what you're getting ready to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12007)|
| 3:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12013)|
| 3:20:14| Can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12014)|
| 3:20:15| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12015)|
| 3:20:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12016)|
| 3:20:17| And I wanted to ask Mr. Kline a couple questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12017)|
| 3:20:18| before they get to closing statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12018)|
| 3:20:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| Mr. Kline, your organization has been very valuable out in West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12023)|
| 3:20:27| for the past 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12027)|
| 3:20:29| And I think your organization sometimes gets a black eye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12029)|
| 3:20:33| because the development community says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12033)|
| 3:20:36| you guys are always against rezoning of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12036)|
| 3:20:39| You don't want new homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12039)|
| 3:20:40| You don't want new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12040)|
| 3:20:42| And that's not really a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12042)|
| 3:20:43| I think your organization has done a great job of working with the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12043)|
| 3:20:48| particularly on the Westland Drive corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| where like the Anthem, when that was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12050)|
| 3:20:53| I think that could get up to four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12053)|
| 3:20:56| but yet they realized that they could maximize their potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12056)|
| 3:21:01| as a development real estate group by making it 1.91 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12061)|
| 3:21:09| And then you look across the street at Woodland Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12069)|
| 3:21:12| right across from A.L. Lots, and, of course, going up that front grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12072)|
| 3:21:16| you know that's tremendous slopes all the way through that whole property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12076)|
| 3:21:20| And I think it's basically about 48 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12080)|
| 3:21:24| But yet that developer realized that they could put 93 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12084)|
| 3:21:29| and it comes out to about 1.9 acres, you know, dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12089)|
| 3:21:36| So I think a lot of people seem to think that you guys are fighting everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12096)|
| 3:21:41| and you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12101)|
| 3:21:42| You guys pick your fights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12102)|
| 3:21:43| When something's wrong, you guys step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| It's very fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12108)|
| 3:21:49| and we've been as reasonable as the regulations would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12109)|
| 3:21:54| I'll point out that at one time when the Pellissippi Parkway was just built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12114)|
| 3:22:00| there was an area of development right around the intersection that was commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12120)|
| 3:22:06| and we stepped up and forced the Food Lion strip mall out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12126)|
| 3:22:12| and brought in Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| That was us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| We did that along with the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12137)|
| 3:22:20| What we're talking about is the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12140)|
| 3:22:22| in a community that cares about its quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12142)|
| 3:22:25| and we have people that work diligently on that behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12145)|
| 3:22:30| We're not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12150)|
| 3:22:32| That would be foolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12152)|
| 3:22:35| And then lastly, I noticed that initially in the correspondence that was sent in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12155)|
| 3:22:40| that the neighborhood said that they wanted, you know, two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12160)|
| 3:22:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12164)|
| 3:22:45| And now that you guys have kind of agreed that maybe 2.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12165)|
| 3:22:49| or somewhere right around there would be equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12169)|
| 3:22:52| So in other words, you've moved upward by 25% in the number of dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12172)|
| 3:22:59| or actually lots that you have, say, 45 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12179)|
| 3:23:02| We have, and the reason we have is because we went and talked to experts in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12182)|
| 3:23:09| and came up with an appropriate, reasonable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12189)|
| 3:23:13| We think 2.4 dwelling units per acre is reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| and it's appropriate for this area, this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12195)|
| 3:23:18| this particular unique piece of 18-acre property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12198)|
| 3:23:22| And then the developer has dropped by just four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12202)|
| 3:23:27| So far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12207)|
| 3:23:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12208)|
| 3:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12209)|
| 3:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12210)|
| 3:23:31| And I just had one question for Mr. McGahee, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12211)|
| 3:23:33| I just want to make sure I understood his comment correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12213)|
| 3:23:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12225)|
| 3:23:46| You may recall we spoke on Friday and I was kind of in the middle of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12226)|
| 3:23:49| I didn't get to ask this question, and you kind of summarized it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12229)|
| 3:23:53| But once you guys reduced the price of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12233)|
| 3:23:58| it now was attractive to developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12238)|
| 3:24:03| Do I understand that if Mr. Mosley decides to walk away from this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12243)|
| 3:24:08| that you do not have somebody else in line that's willing to exercise an option on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12248)|
| 3:24:14| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12254)|
| 3:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12256)|
| 3:24:17| But typically a developer wouldn't exercise an option on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12257)|
| 3:24:21| if there was already an option in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| He would wait until that expires and then come and approach you and make a deposit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12263)|
| 3:24:27| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12267)|
| 3:24:28| But the person we're dealing with as our agent has certainly not given us any indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12268)|
| 3:24:36| that anyone else is interested in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12276)|
| 3:24:39| But you don't know for sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| Oh, I do know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12281)|
| 3:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12282)|
| 3:24:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12283)|
| 3:24:44| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12284)|
| 3:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12285)|
| 3:24:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12286)|
| 3:24:47| There's nobody else in the wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12287)|
| 3:24:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| Just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12289)|
| 3:24:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12290)|
| 3:24:51| This is a very difficult piece of property to sell simply because of the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12291)|
| 3:24:57| as we looked into it more and more, the only practical use of this property now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12297)|
| 3:25:05| is to go on to become a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12305)|
| 3:25:09| Which the community agrees with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| So, you know, this is one of the, we've had a very difficult time selling this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12311)|
| 3:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12317)|
| 3:25:20| Let me make one more statement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12320)|
| 3:25:24| And I want to say this to the community and I want you to listen real carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12324)|
| 3:25:27| You're going to set a precedence of about two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12327)|
| 3:25:31| And when you do that, that means that's going to reduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12331)|
| 3:25:34| I see about seven or eight pieces of property here that are developable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12334)|
| 3:25:39| that probably can use up to four units an acre in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12339)|
| 3:25:45| That means you're going to set that property out there that you're going to go up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12345)|
| 3:25:50| and they're going to say two units per acre is what you're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12350)|
| 3:25:54| That's what you're requesting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12354)|
| 3:25:56| So that means without getting those extra traffic on Moorfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12356)|
| 3:26:03| you're not going to get that road widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12363)|
| 3:26:06| You're still going to have the problem of getting out from Westland and Bluegrass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12366)|
| 3:26:13| You're still going to have that problem, but you're still going to have the traffic problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12373)|
| 3:26:16| And only government reacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12376)|
| 3:26:19| It does not proact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| So in my area out in Powell, you talk about hill developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12381)|
| 3:26:25| We went from one to four to five to six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12385)|
| 3:26:28| We built on hills and everything out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12388)|
| 3:26:30| When I moved out in Powell, Emory Road was smaller than Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12390)|
| 3:26:37| That's five lanes, four lanes with a turning lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12397)|
| 3:26:40| And we've got all kinds of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12400)|
| 3:26:42| But it's going to reduce your amount of what you've got invested in your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12402)|
| 3:26:47| what you're going to sell it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12407)|
| 3:26:48| It's going to set a precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| And I just want you to know that whichever way it goes, if it goes to 2 to 2.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12410)|
| 3:26:56| it's going to be a problem down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| And I know because we have some in our area that we set that precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12419)|
| 3:27:04| and we lost a lot of beautiful developments out there because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12424)|
| 3:27:08| So, anyway, it's y'all's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12428)|
| 3:27:10| You know, you've voiced your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12430)|
| 3:27:12| We just have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12432)|
| 3:27:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12433)|
| 3:27:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12434)|
| 3:27:15| I think everybody's made their statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12435)|
| 3:27:18| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12438)|
| 3:27:22| Yeah, I'm Bradford Smith, 1220 Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12442)|
| 3:27:27| You mentioned widening Emory Road to five lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| I don't know if you realize that Moorfield Road runs right through the ridge cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12450)|
| 3:27:35| There's no way you could widen that, for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12455)|
| 3:27:38| We had the same problem out there on Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12458)|
| 3:27:43| Have you been out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| I believe Mr. Brown's been out there and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| I don't know if anybody else has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12467)|
| 3:27:48| I know through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12468)|
| 3:27:51| Well, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12471)|
| 3:27:52| I've been on roads that we find in Powell out there, and it's been worse than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12472)|
| 3:27:56| Anyway, we live on the driveway that runs straight up the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12476)|
| 3:28:00| right at the south end of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12480)|
| 3:28:03| And, again, the traffic is getting out of our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12483)|
| 3:28:07| Being able to see where traffic comes around that curve is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12487)|
| 3:28:11| People come down the hill at a rapid rate of speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12491)|
| 3:28:15| And we've had numerous cars in our ditch at both sides of our driveway from the slant of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12495)|
| 3:28:23| and when water runs across it, it freezes, and it's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12503)|
| 3:28:30| I'm very concerned about the traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12512)|
| 3:28:33| If you want to see one development out there where we had, try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12513)|
| 3:28:38| Tate Trotter going down to Vickie Road from my subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12518)|
| 3:28:42| It's worse than anything that you've got out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12522)|
| 3:28:46| Well, I've lived out there since 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12526)|
| 3:28:48| I used to be able to jog along that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12528)|
| 3:28:50| I wouldn't dare do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12530)|
| 3:28:51| And you had, like I said, 60 more houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12531)|
| 3:28:54| You're just asking for more trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12534)|
| 3:28:56| But you don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12536)|
| 3:28:57| You've got a beautiful piece of property out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| A lot of people want to get out there, and that's what I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| A lot of people want to be out there, and that's very exciting for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12542)|
| 3:29:07| because that makes your property valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| But limiting the development also makes your property less valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12550)|
| 3:29:13| And the other thing you said, setting a precedent for the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12553)|
| 3:29:16| I mean, this is specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12556)|
| 3:29:18| As you said, it's a specific piece of property with quite a big slope there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12558)|
| 3:29:22| It's not the rest of the neighborhood is on different terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12562)|
| 3:29:25| I understand, but what it is is a developable piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12565)|
| 3:29:28| We've had people ask for a lot of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12568)|
| 3:29:32| and they can only build on about a third of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12572)|
| 3:29:35| and they get about a third of the density they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12575)|
| 3:29:37| And EPA is not going to let them touch that blue way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12577)|
| 3:29:40| I mean, it's going to be really hard to develop on that end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12580)|
| 3:29:44| But anyway, I mean, you've made your talk, and I just want to express to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12584)|
| 3:29:48| people want to live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12588)|
| 3:29:49| That's the situation, and that's why the demand is for that property out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12589)|
| 3:29:53| You ought to be very proud of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12593)|
| 3:29:56| I'm just concerned of the safety for everybody that lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12596)|
| 3:29:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12599)|
| 3:30:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12600)|
| 3:30:01| What we're going to do now is allow for five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12601)|
| 3:30:06| and then we will, if there's any questions after that, the commissioners will have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12606)|
| 3:30:11| So let's go ahead, and Arthur, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12611)|
| 3:30:19| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12619)|
| 3:30:21| just a couple of things in response to the speakers we have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12621)|
| 3:30:26| The traffic counts on Moorfield, and this is from 2013, are 2,200 trips per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12626)|
| 3:30:37| and that's developed by Knox County and the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12637)|
| 3:30:43| During the past three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| the Sheriff's Department reports that there have been seven accidents on Moorfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12645)|
| 3:30:50| So you multiply 2,200 a day times 365 days a year, and traffic accidents are very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12650)|
| 3:31:01| So the road must be in pretty good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12661)|
| 3:31:03| Mr. Jules talks about problems with cars maybe in his driveway at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12663)|
| 3:31:11| That describes roads all over Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12671)|
| 3:31:17| Go anywhere in the city of Knoxville, which plows the streets and salts them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12677)|
| 3:31:23| you're going to find people that can't get out of their driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12683)|
| 3:31:27| Now, Commissioner Brown raised an interesting issue when he said, you know, all the flat land is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12687)|
| 3:31:38| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12698)|
| 3:31:40| There's a few pastures out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12700)|
| 3:31:42| But in response to that, Knox County Engineering and you all as commissioners or your predecessors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12702)|
| 3:31:51| have enacted fairly strict new ordinances regulating streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12711)|
| 3:31:58| Now, a lot of that's dictated from above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12718)|
| 3:32:00| It comes from the state of Tennessee and the EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| That's why you cannot build within 50 feet of the top of a stream bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12722)|
| 3:32:09| That's defined as a blue line stream, which this one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12729)|
| 3:32:13| Knox County enacted three or four years ago a very strict new street and stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12733)|
| 3:32:21| Somebody criticized it, but I think if you talk to most developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12741)|
| 3:32:25| they will say it is as strict basically as the city of Knoxville's and as any in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12745)|
| 3:32:34| We're losing usable land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12754)|
| 3:32:37| We're having to wisely use land as we go forward, as Commissioner Brown pointed out, since all the flat land is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12757)|
| 3:32:45| That's why we have policies such as the hillside protection plan, which Mr. Hill has explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12765)|
| 3:32:55| We are down in this zoning issue here to an issue of between 45 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12775)|
| 3:33:04| which Mr. Kline has argued for on this property, and Mr. Smith at 57 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12784)|
| 3:33:12| We're talking about a 12-unit difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12792)|
| 3:33:19| You might say, well, why can't you drop to 57?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12799)|
| 3:33:24| When you go through the development process, you're going to spend a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12804)|
| 3:33:28| You're going to spend a lot on engineers, Fulger, McEnoe, and all sorts of other engineering firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12808)|
| 3:33:34| You're going to build roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12814)|
| 3:33:37| You're going to dedicate right-of-way to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12817)|
| 3:33:40| You're going to lose the front of your property so they can get that 60 foot or 30 feet on either side of center line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12820)|
| 3:33:47| And that's just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12827)|
| 3:33:49| To develop this property, you're looking at a million plus dollars plus land acquisition cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12829)|
| 3:33:58| There is a point at which you cannot make money unless you have a certain level of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12838)|
| 3:34:06| And that's what Mr. Mosley and Mr. Smith are asking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12846)|
| 3:34:12| And I would turn it over to Mr. Smith if he has any other comments he would like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12852)|
| 3:34:19| Thank you all for listening to this and taking your time to hear our arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12859)|
| 3:34:24| All I would say pretty much is what you've already heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12864)|
| 3:34:27| We're in line with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| This is a piece of property that does have some slopes, but the majority of this property is very flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12869)|
| 3:34:35| You'll see that in the slope analysis on the top page, what we handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12875)|
| 3:34:39| The trend in the area is in excess of what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12879)|
| 3:34:44| I mean, all the rezonings that have taken place, as you guys know, two of the projects we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12884)|
| 3:34:49| We've done 20 of these subdivisions all in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12889)|
| 3:34:53| We do a nice product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12893)|
| 3:34:54| I'm proud of the things we turn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12894)|
| 3:34:56| We're not going to turn out something that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12896)|
| 3:34:58| What I would also say to the people that live in the area that are against it is that there are families out there that want to enjoy the same benefits that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12898)|
| 3:35:06| They want their kids to go to the school down the street and be a minute and a half off the parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12906)|
| 3:35:11| If density that we're asking for is not right at this location, I don't see how you can approve it anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12911)|
| 3:35:17| That's really all I have to say, but thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12917)|
| 3:35:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12920)|
| 3:35:21| Mr. Kline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12921)|
| 3:35:27| It's this location that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12927)|
| 3:35:30| This location is a unique location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12930)|
| 3:35:33| It's unique because it's got a blue line stream that comes through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12933)|
| 3:35:37| It's got ridges, and if you haven't been there, don't listen to what you're hearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12937)|
| 3:35:44| Those ridges and the slopes are extremely, extremely sloped, such that some are greater than 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12944)|
| 3:35:53| If you haven't seen it, don't listen to what you've been hearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12953)|
| 3:35:58| Ridgetop Protection Plan says when you get into slopes like that, the recommended, as we've been hearing recommendations, maximum land disturbance factor is for 40% or more only 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12958)|
| 3:36:11| Don't touch the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12971)|
| 3:36:14| Don't allow clear cutting and then movement of land such that it's all gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12974)|
| 3:36:21| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12981)|
| 3:36:22| In this particular unique circumstance, the water will flow down and flood Traymore Village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12982)|
| 3:36:29| and it will flood this area before it gets down over a mile and a half away to the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12989)|
| 3:36:39| We've been hearing about concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=12999)|
| 3:36:43| The concept plan was already approved based upon a condition that this body would approve the recommended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13003)|
| 3:36:54| This is our last time to talk as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13014)|
| 3:36:58| That's why we're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13018)|
| 3:37:00| But, you know, at the MPC level, we brought up the Knox County Engineering Division Regulation 34-10 about the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13020)|
| 3:37:11| that says after review of the concept plan, the Knox County Engineering Division shall provide the Planning Commission with a written statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13031)|
| 3:37:21| relative to the general acceptability of proposed roads, drainage systems, and related improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13041)|
| 3:37:27| You've heard both sides talk tonight about drainage systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13047)|
| 3:37:31| They're not even acceptable yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13051)|
| 3:37:34| They're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13054)|
| 3:37:40| The four units that abut on Moorfield Road, you have to come off of Moorfield Road to get on those four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13060)|
| 3:37:49| The land around the Blue Line Stream and the land up the slopes are all undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13069)|
| 3:37:56| And because of that, this property should not be zoned with a density higher than 2.4 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13076)|
| 3:38:05| This unique piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13085)|
| 3:38:08| And with all due respect, Chairman Bussler, we have chosen as a community, we have chosen as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13088)|
| 3:38:15| that that is the appropriate density, and we're asking that you support the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13095)|
| 3:38:20| You are our elected representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13100)|
| 3:38:24| We're asking you to support your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13104)|
| 3:38:30| Mr. Kline, I've got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13110)|
| 3:38:32| It's kind of going back to what we talked about density-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13112)|
| 3:38:36| I should have asked this while ago, and it just came to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13116)|
| 3:38:38| I'm looking at maps and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13118)|
| 3:38:41| Lake Heritage is 20 acres, the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13121)|
| 3:38:47| And every bit of it, except for the retention pond, has got units on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13127)|
| 3:38:50| I don't know that it built out at 1.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13130)|
| 3:38:56| I'm going to look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13136)|
| 3:38:58| I'm looking at the map and the whole thing is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13138)|
| 3:38:59| I'm not an expert on every one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| But going back to, I guess your argument is that something was zoned at 4 and built out at 2 point something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13141)|
| 3:39:08| All these other subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13148)|
| 3:39:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13149)|
| 3:39:10| So what's to say that this subdivision wouldn't be zoned at 4.2 or 4.1, 3.1, whatever, and be built out at 2.7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13150)|
| 3:39:17| You're to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13157)|
| 3:39:18| You're to take a look at this as our elected representatives and say zoning at a higher density is improper for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13158)|
| 3:39:25| This is our last chance to talk in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| Then based on your argument, all of these zonings that we've done in that area that zoned at 4, built out at 2, we were wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13167)|
| 3:39:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13177)|
| 3:39:38| Based on my argument, this is a unique piece of property that needs to be considered uniquely because of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13178)|
| 3:39:47| That's what we're here about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13187)|
| 3:39:48| We're not here about with everything else out there in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13188)|
| 3:39:53| Then why did we bring them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13193)|
| 3:39:55| I didn't bring them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13195)|
| 3:39:56| I'm responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13196)|
| 3:39:57| Heritage Lake has 106.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13197)|
| 3:40:00| It's zoned at 3.2 dwelling units per acre and it's built out at 3.0 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13200)|
| 3:40:08| The apartment complex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13208)|
| 3:40:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13209)|
| 3:40:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13210)|
| 3:40:13| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13215)|
| 3:40:17| Your last little bit there troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13217)|
| 3:40:26| You talk about how we have to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13226)|
| 3:40:29| We can't when we've got a bunch of emails talking about everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13229)|
| 3:40:34| And what you're saying is the density of everything else has put the congestion on Moorfield Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13234)|
| 3:40:39| So we can't look at this in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13239)|
| 3:40:45| The slope isn't unique to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| There are some other properties that's built on some pretty steep slopes in these developed neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13247)|
| 3:40:54| So, you know, that's what I struggle with is opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13254)|
| 3:40:59| You know, these folks had an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13259)|
| 3:41:02| These developers had an opportunity to build here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13262)|
| 3:41:04| And, you know, I started out on this commission not fully understanding, you know, land rights in terms of the intrinsic value that that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13264)|
| 3:41:13| But I've developed a healthy appreciation for it over these, you know, past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13273)|
| 3:41:18| So I struggle with you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13278)|
| 3:41:22| And I understand this is before it's now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13282)|
| 3:41:25| But it's kind of selective in my opinion, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13285)|
| 3:41:29| So if I just look at it and say, what's everyone else doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13289)|
| 3:41:32| That's not the conversation you want to have on this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13292)|
| 3:41:38| So, you know, I'm nowhere near these numbers that I see of these other subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13298)|
| 3:41:45| But it does trouble me that we want to kind of cherry pick this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13305)|
| 3:41:52| And that's what I'm hearing toward the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13312)|
| 3:41:55| So I'm just being honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13315)|
| 3:41:57| That troubled me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13317)|
| 3:41:58| So help me understand why I can't consider if we talked about roads and we talked about angles and wrecks and whatnot, that now we have to throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13318)|
| 3:42:10| You said you didn't bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13330)|
| 3:42:12| But your constituents brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13332)|
| 3:42:15| So the folks that you're speaking for brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13335)|
| 3:42:19| So, again, that just troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13339)|
| 3:42:22| So go ahead and please reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13342)|
| 3:42:23| Yes, Commissioner, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13343)|
| 3:42:26| When we brought it up or when the constituents brought it up, we talked about other developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13346)|
| 3:42:31| But those developments don't have the kind of slopes and don't have the undevelopable land that this property has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13351)|
| 3:42:39| And that's the distinction that we want you to make with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13359)|
| 3:42:43| And that's why we are arguing that affects the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13363)|
| 3:42:48| That affects the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13368)|
| 3:42:49| We don't think it should be agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13369)|
| 3:42:52| We think you should go ahead and zone at PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13372)|
| 3:42:57| We're just talking about the density of this particular unique piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13377)|
| 3:43:02| As compared with others, if you look at all those others, you won't find slopes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13382)|
| 3:43:07| You won't find a blue-line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13387)|
| 3:43:08| You won't find the undevelopable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13388)|
| 3:43:11| And that's what we're asking you to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13391)|
| 3:43:18| So, sir, let me continue with that line for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13398)|
| 3:43:25| Then on this unique piece of property, I need to back us up a little bit and get started from a different point of view, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13405)|
| 3:43:38| Let me pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13418)|
| 3:43:40| We've had before us tonight three rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13420)|
| 3:43:46| One was just to change it to low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13426)|
| 3:43:52| And those people will not be back at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13432)|
| 3:43:56| They've been granted a right to go develop a piece of property as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13436)|
| 3:44:03| The second piece of property I think that we had tonight was rezoned to low-density planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13443)|
| 3:44:12| which means they have to develop some plans and come back to MPC and get those plans approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13452)|
| 3:44:30| The third one, I guess, is the same, same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13470)|
| 3:44:36| It's a rezoning to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13476)|
| 3:44:41| And now we're on the fourth piece of property, and I'm not going to say it's all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13481)|
| 3:44:49| but we're trying to apply the same rules that we apply all over the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13489)|
| 3:44:57| and I can't find us applying the same rules on both sides of Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13497)|
| 3:45:06| On Emory Church Road, people didn't like the concept of the plan that it took us three years to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13506)|
| 3:45:16| that was related to slope and ridge to centralize the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13516)|
| 3:45:22| and use the unit for the entire piece of property into a more dense location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13522)|
| 3:45:31| which left a lot of vegetation and large trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13531)|
| 3:45:36| When that particular rezoning was before us, that concept was not appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13536)|
| 3:45:43| It wasn't liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| Now we've come across to the south side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13545)|
| 3:45:48| and we're going to dividing the property up into small lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13548)|
| 3:45:53| not centralizing the development or concentrating the development and leaving trees and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13553)|
| 3:46:02| So that concept doesn't seem to fit either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13562)|
| 3:46:08| Now, both of those are on the books of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13568)|
| 3:46:11| You can concentrate your development into one area and set aside the rest of it and it never be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13571)|
| 3:46:18| or you can develop the old style way of just dividing it up into little pie pieces and build on every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13578)|
| 3:46:25| But both of those concepts are okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13585)|
| 3:46:28| The thing I'm straining at is that we're having this discussion about a piece of property that I've heard the comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13588)|
| 3:46:40| you must not have looked at it or you've not driven the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13600)|
| 3:46:45| Morefield Road looks like Borough Road that I live on in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13605)|
| 3:46:52| And whenever I, accompanied by my staff in the staff car, traveled there the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13612)|
| 3:47:01| the most discouraging thing that happened to us was that the Red Robin was full of people sitting in the front reception area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13621)|
| 3:47:10| so we went back toward Bearden and had lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13630)|
| 3:47:16| It's a really nice area, really nice area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13636)|
| 3:47:20| It has a very diverse cross-section of county, and I'm not disparaging anyone's style of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13640)|
| 3:47:36| There are certain houses there that wouldn't fit on one-acre footprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13656)|
| 3:47:43| I'm saying there are large homes in the area, and it takes an acre to accommodate that structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13663)|
| 3:47:50| some of the structures that I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13670)|
| 3:47:52| And then there are other structures that had to be built in the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13672)|
| 3:48:01| It's just the way the community has developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13681)|
| 3:48:03| As you drive on bluegrass, and I drove bluegrass over to the elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13683)|
| 3:48:10| and I'm reminded of years gone by, the development of a daycare center was very adamantly opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13690)|
| 3:48:22| and I see that the daycare center has either ran, whoever it was that was catty-cornered from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13702)|
| 3:48:27| is either Weigel's or Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13707)|
| 3:48:33| The daycare has run Weigel's out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13713)|
| 3:48:36| Please take that with a grain of salt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13716)|
| 3:48:41| because I want you to realize that even though this is life or death, or maybe this isn't life or death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13721)|
| 3:48:49| we sit here tonight, we have to deal with five rezonings, one which got withdrawn, three which went pretty quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13729)|
| 3:49:03| and then one that's in the area where I've been there several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13743)|
| 3:49:12| Next to the Fox Road Marina was proposed a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13752)|
| 3:49:16| I commented to my staff, well, not only is there not a restaurant there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13756)|
| 3:49:21| the little old house is still there, and the trees fell through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13761)|
| 3:49:26| Now, that's not anyone's fault, but it is something that I have to say in order that people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13766)|
| 3:49:38| we have very difficult decisions in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13778)|
| 3:49:42| and I want you to know that because it's been questioned whether or not we give enough consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13782)|
| 3:49:54| to even go drive by the places that are brought up that we know will be large decision factors in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13794)|
| 3:50:03| What I would, and I'm not making a motion on how this rezoning should take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13803)|
| 3:50:11| I would like for my fellow commissioners to look at what we've done on the others that we've had before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13811)|
| 3:50:18| and without a doubt, if there was a three unit per acre development proposed in the 8th District, that's East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13818)|
| 3:50:36| I believe without a shadow of a doubt this commission would pass it if it were the same as the layout of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13836)|
| 3:50:46| that you're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13846)|
| 3:50:51| Everything else equal, hilly, slopey, narrow road, wide road, Emory Road, Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13851)|
| 3:51:01| I believe that this commission would pass something on me that looks exactly like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13861)|
| 3:51:06| and we would have probably done it an hour and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13866)|
| 3:51:10| That's just my opinion, and I think I'm entitled to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13870)|
| 3:51:13| And, again, let me reinforce the fact I've traveled up and down these roads that are questioned here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13873)|
| 3:51:21| Blue Grass and Emory Church and other developments that have been brought before commission in a questioning mode in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13881)|
| 3:51:34| and thanks for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13894)|
| 3:51:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13896)|
| 3:51:37| I don't think I had a question of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13897)|
| 3:51:38| I believe I just wanted to make, I wanted to clear my consciousness of the fact this is a difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13898)|
| 3:51:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13909)|
| 3:51:50| Mr. Clown, real quick before you sit down, I'm trying to do my math here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13910)|
| 3:51:53| 3.2 equals 57 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13913)|
| 3:51:55| What was your all's request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13915)|
| 3:51:56| 2.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13916)|
| 3:51:57| 2.2 to 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13917)|
| 3:52:00| Equals what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13920)|
| 3:52:01| 40 to 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13921)|
| 3:52:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13923)|
| 3:52:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13924)|
| 3:52:07| Yes, Mr. Vice Chairman, this is my first meeting, so I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13927)|
| 3:52:13| When you relate it to the existing cases that we've just voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13933)|
| 3:52:18| the previous one we voted on is from just north of Farragut on Campbell Station Road in Mr. Andrews' district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13938)|
| 3:52:25| and that was PR, and we voted for one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13945)|
| 3:52:29| So I don't think you're trying to say that we should follow those kind of guidelines, that whatever we've done just today or my practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13949)|
| 3:52:40| I think what I am trying to clear through my own being tonight is the fact that Metropolitan Planning Commission came before us with 67 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13960)|
| 3:52:53| and I believe their calculations that I wrote down from being made by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13973)|
| 3:53:01| is that there is the possibility when it is calculated out to have 67.8 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13981)|
| 3:53:09| Now then, whatever MPC has recommended to us could be something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13989)|
| 3:53:14| My comments about what we've approved tonight are based on MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=13994)|
| 3:53:20| If they had recommended one in every five acres, it would still have been their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14000)|
| 3:53:27| and we did approve that one to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14007)|
| 3:53:31| And I believe the one to the acre is approved because it is in the county with septic service, not sewer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14011)|
| 3:53:40| It sits on top of a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14020)|
| 3:53:42| But it is the overriding regulation, MPC, sir, would be that the W Boyd Lowness was recommended at one per the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14022)|
| 3:53:58| because it is septic tank service, not sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14038)|
| 3:54:05| The primary reason, sir, for that request was to allow them to put all the frontage lots right on Black Road for the driveway access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14045)|
| 3:54:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| And that was approved per their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14057)|
| 3:54:21| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14061)|
| 3:54:24| He talks so long I forgot what I was going to say now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14064)|
| 3:54:32| The one point I wanted to bring up is the fact that these 67.8 are calculated on the max in a particular zoning, three to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14072)|
| 3:54:47| Very, very seldom is the max ever built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14087)|
| 3:54:51| But you can't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14091)|
| 3:54:52| Let me rephrase what I said a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14092)|
| 3:54:55| I wasn't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14095)|
| 3:54:56| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14096)|
| 3:54:58| Please, if you deal with the fact that I was trying to present, that is the calculated max for this discrete piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14098)|
| 3:55:09| It's not on the average piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14109)|
| 3:55:11| It's the calculation for this individual unique piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14111)|
| 3:55:17| At the max of five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14117)|
| 3:55:20| No, no, it's at slope and ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14120)|
| 3:55:24| It's at the slope and ridge, not at the max of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14124)|
| 3:55:28| 3.78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14128)|
| 3:55:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14132)|
| 3:55:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14133)|
| 3:55:35| Can I make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14135)|
| 3:55:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14136)|
| 3:55:37| Can I move that we approve it at 3.2 units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14137)|
| 3:55:40| It needs a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14140)|
| 3:55:41| At what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14141)|
| 3:55:42| 3.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14142)|
| 3:55:43| It went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14143)|
| 3:55:48| The original motion was 3.4, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14148)|
| 3:55:50| 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14150)|
| 3:55:51| 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14151)|
| 3:55:52| Now it's down 3.2 on a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14152)|
| 3:55:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14156)|
| 3:55:57| Do we have any idea how many homes will that end up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14157)|
| 3:56:00| 3.2 is 57 if the concept is accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14160)|
| 3:56:10| Oh, that's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14170)|
| 3:56:14| I'll second for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14174)|
| 3:56:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14176)|
| 3:56:17| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| At 3.2 an acre on a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14179)|
| 3:56:23| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14183)|
| 3:56:27| Roll call vote in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14187)|
| 3:56:31| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14191)|
| 3:56:32| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14192)|
| 3:56:33| Commissioner McKenzie passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14193)|
| 3:56:35| Commissioner Boyles is absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14197)|
| 3:56:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14198)|
| 3:56:39| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14199)|
| 3:56:41| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14201)|
| 3:56:42| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14202)|
| 3:56:43| Commissioner Owenby passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14203)|
| 3:56:45| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=14205)|
