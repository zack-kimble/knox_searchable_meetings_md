| 0:00:00| I'd like to go ahead and call this city of Knoxville workshop to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=0)|
| 0:00:09| And we'll start with the invocation by Councilman Brown and the pledge by Councilman Del Boca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9)|
| 0:00:15| Everybody would stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=15)|
| 0:00:17| Let us bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=17)|
| 0:00:19| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=19)|
| 0:00:23| We thank you for this opportunity to come together and serve this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=23)|

| 0:00:38| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=41)|
| 0:00:45| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=45)|
| 0:00:56| Councilman Wilson, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=56)|

| 0:01:08| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| We have a quorum, and we're going to jump right into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=78)|
| 0:01:25| Mr. Pines, I assume everybody has a copy of this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=85)|
| 0:01:32| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| I thought what we would do tonight is here's one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| We need one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Is, you know, obviously at the last meeting we took the straw poll and it came out the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=106)|
| 0:01:57| And so Mr. Pennington has outlined specifics to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| And I thought if we could go through Mr. Pennington and I spoke earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| and perhaps we were off target, we could be off target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| but identify some of the issues that I think that we could perhaps put to bed quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| And then obviously there's going to be some issues, you know, with certain bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| So if we could, I'd like to go down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| And what I'll do is have Mr. Pennington just kind of give a very brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| And then if there's we need further discussion, then we can go down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| And if not, then we can agree and start to whittle this plan down and get it to where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| we can finally have a final document to where we could bring to, I guess, Mr. Gilbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=165)|
| 0:02:53| I would assume is going to draft this and move this process along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| So if we can, you know, keep the conversation to the plan itself this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| I think it will benefit us all and get us a lot closer to where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| We don't have another meeting scheduled as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| And perhaps we might be able to get something firm tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| And if not, we'll keep working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| But let's keep that the goal this evening, if we could, to walk out of here with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| So with that, Mr. Pennington, I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Again, it's a pleasure to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| I always love coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| And it's a pleasure to work with the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| We were talking before the meeting and just really what a pleasure it's been to work with everybody through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| I know it's been difficult, but I think the council, the administration, and the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| everybody has worked to make a lot of progress, get us to a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| Tonight, what I hope to do and hope to help you do is look at some of these major issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| what I've called the levers impacting the DBDC-MAX plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| And to the extent that we can, that the council can agree sort of on these big picture items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| then I think it would be sufficient to pass off for the attorneys to work on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| At this point, Vice Mayor, do you want me to just take one item at a time, or how would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| Yeah, I mean, we started it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| We thought the first two would probably render some discussion, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| So if you want to start at number three, we'll certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| We'll see how our assumptions were about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Item number three is the interest crediting rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| I've assumed for purpose of the proposal and for everything up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| that the defined contribution accounts would be credited at the rate of return of the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| which I presume would be around six and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Of course, that's not a guaranteed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| So to the extent the council is comfortable with that assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| or you want to have discussion on that, I think now would be the time for that particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| You're going to have to enlarge on that just a little bit for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| Why would the rate of return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Why would we have to have an assumed rate of return on the defined contribution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| You're talking about the defined contribution portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| For purposes of costing the plan, I had to make some assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| But the rate is going to be whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| But to some degree, if you're making $40,000 a year and the rate's five percent, the DB plan kicks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| and so then there's a cost associated with the DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| I mean, six and a half or eight percent might not make any difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| but depending on what your salary level is, at some point, the defined benefit component would kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| And so for purposes of my projections, I had to make some assumption about future returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=340)|
| 0:05:49| So we're not going to segregate these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| They're going to be commingled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| Well, there's going to be one bucket of assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| To the extent that the defined benefit plan is the larger plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| then your retirement benefit was going to be based on that two percent per year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| two percent of pay times years of service limited to $40,000 or whatever is determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| Or if the account balance, you know, results in a larger benefit, your benefit is based on that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| So it's one bucket of assets and then those assets will be used to provide an annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| It will just be a matter of whether the annuity ends up being based on the DB benefit or the DC benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| But it is just one bucket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| even though there will be different accounting as we account for these individual accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=393)|
| 0:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| You picked six and a half percent, which is more conservative than the seven and three-eighths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| but less conservative than the, what did we experience, 5.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| I mean, where does the number come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Just a midpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| For purposes of the projections and of the forecast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| my assumption is that the pension board would be relatively more conservative than they are on the current investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Currently, as you know, we're at seven and three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| Whether or not the long-term investment policy drives a five percent return or a six percent return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| I mean, six and a half seem to be a relatively reasonable amount to start with in terms of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| how much is this plan going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Let's do some projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| At the end of the day, for many people, whether the return is six percent or seven percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| they're going to get their account balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| So you plug the number in so that you can analyze how it works out through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Yeah, the six and a half percent is not part of the plan document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| I mean, that's just an assumption I made for costing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| So that you can run costing out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Yeah, I apologize if I gave the misimpression that I was saying let's adopt six and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| It would work as well if you used 5.68 or whatever the 10-year average was, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| It's just a number you plug in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| What is the tendency as you either go down or up, which plan changes the most?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| I mean, does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Well, I mean, as the interest rate goes down, the DB plan is more likely to come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| particularly for lower paid employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| Councilman Grieve, are you do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| I don't know if you had a body language tells me you might have had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Maybe I'm assuming something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| I like your lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Don't encourage him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Am I glowing or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| I'll keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| The light's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| I'll keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| So, I mean, do you want to do you want to just say, okay, we have a consensus on this, you know, on these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| How do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| We can vote them if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| I'm glad to do a vote, you know, if we want to do a vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| That six and a half percent is just an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| The six and a half, right, is just a number I was using for my projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| That's not part of the document that I'm asking you to accept at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| His light is fully realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Vice Mayor, the mayor just said that maybe I should clarify what I'm asking you to vote on is to accept that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| the rate of return credited on the fund is whatever the fund earns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| So, if the fund earns four percent, then there's a four percent credit to people's accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| That's what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| What it's going to be is what it realistically is going to be every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| You're just using that as an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| So, my light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| I knew it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Councilman Wallace, are you comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| I'm just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| I don't know what the protocol is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| I'm going to go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| It's not going to be quite so easy or may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| So, I just, yeah, I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| I just don't know how you're going to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| I'm just going to assume because there's no dissent that we accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| Well, I mean, I'm personally I think it's too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| I mean, the ten-year rate of return is 5.2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| Why are we adopting a plan based on 6.5 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| At this point, the plan itself, we're just saying whatever the rate of return is is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| Now, the costing numbers is a totally different discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| but this is just talking about the plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| So, it's not 6.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| I mean, it's just whatever the rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| It's just whatever the rate of return is in the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| So, but aren't we're being told this plan costs so much based on 6.5 percent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| I mean, there's two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| One question is what does the plan cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| The other question is how does the plan operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| And what I was trying to address in these is how does the plan operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| The whole question, what does the plan cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Then you've got to make all sorts of assumptions about turnover, retirement, future investment return, la, la, la, la, la.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| But this is just saying how, you know, if we're going to use this plan, how does it operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| So, forget the 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| He used that as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| That's not what you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| The question is whether you will, whether the interest crediting rate will be assumed to be the rate of return earned by the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| the actual rate of return earned by the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| No numbers are associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| It's whatever it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Well, I mean, I'd certainly agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| But in terms of costing the plan, I mean, let's just think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| This is what we're being told of how much this plan is going to cost is based on the 6.5 percent number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| And the 10-year rate of return is 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| No, that's a different number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| I've said the 10-year rate of return for our current assets is 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| So, we are adopting this plan based upon 6.5, a whole more than a point greater than our 10-year rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=718)|
| 0:12:08| I think that's a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| That's another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Mr. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| In order to try to expedite this, I mean, if you even did a quick show of hands and we had a majority and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| okay, this one's done, let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| I mean, I don't know how you guys want to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| Item three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Can we move on to item four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| The normal retirement age had been suggested to be age 62 for the general government, age 55 and 25 years for the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=762)|
| 0:12:50| and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| The only additional proviso that I put on that, I said if there's going to be a 10-year vesting schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| which has been suggested, that perhaps it makes sense that the normal retirement age should be 62| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| and 10 years of service in general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| So, you don't automatically vest just because you get to be age 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| And in the fire and police, it would also be a maximum retirement age not to exceed 62 and 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=790)|
| 0:13:18| So, if you happen to be in the fire and police and you quit and you didn't have 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| then you could still get a retirement benefit at 62 and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Now, that's not going to affect a whole lot of people in the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| and police because most of them are hired relatively young just because of the way the career is running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| in the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| But just for simplicity and consistency's sake, my recommendation on that was 62 and 10 for the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=817)|
| 0:13:45| 55 and 25 on the fire and police, but not after 62 and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| So, before I guess I ask if you agree or disagree, is there any clarification that you would like to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| No clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| No clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| But originally you wrote this plan out and proposed 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| I just wonder why you changed it to 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| I was instructed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| I mean, if that's not acceptable and, you know, the first numbers I costed were 65 and 58, 57, 65 and 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=853)|
| 0:14:24| And then we came back and said, well, if we change this, how much does it change the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| And so the most recent numbers that I generated were at the 62 and 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Now, if that's, you know, obviously if the ages are older, then the cost is a bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=874)|
| 0:14:42| If the age is younger, it's a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| But it's still, you know, either way I still think it's within that seven, eight percent of pay long term, which I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| you know, my impression was that's kind of what we were shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| Councilman Dalbope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| On the, I was, I put my light on for the retirement age part, so let me go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| I understood you saying 55 and 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| That's kind of what we do now, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| It's a rule of 75 or at least it's close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| What's the not later than 62 and 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| In other words, you can't put money in the retirement system after age 62?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Let's say that you're in the fire and police and you're in the unusual position of having been hired at a later age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| So you're hired at 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| And then you work until age 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Well, that's 15 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Under the initial provisions of 55 and 25, you're still not eligible for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| You're not eligible for a retirement benefit until the date you would have gotten 25 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| The 62 and 10 is an additional cap that says, okay, well, if you're 62 and 10 years of service in fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=944)|
| 0:15:54| then you could go ahead and take a retirement benefit at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| But it would be a lesser benefit because you haven't put in as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| We don't have anything like Social Security that if you take an early retirement, you get reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Like age 66, if you opt in at 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| There's not a coordination with Social Security in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| Councilman, your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| You kind of flickered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| I'll just throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| I'll propose 65 and 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Beat on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| That's what he originally proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| I don't really have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| I think 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| You're saying 65 general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| 65 general government and 57 fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| That's just my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1014)|
| 0:16:54| I mean, that's what he had originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I kind of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| I don't see anything wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| That's a little higher than what some of our other competing cities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| I'll throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Beat it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| I could address that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| In terms of the change that folks asked about, the change came after discussions with the employee groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| and all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| It was part of their coming to an agreement to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| Also, I might add on relative to the 62, it's a substantial change without the rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| As you will note at the various agendas that come up when retirees come right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| substantial numbers of people are retiring in general government well under 62 with the rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| And this prevents any full retirement until 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| So that was the thinking behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| And in working with the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| I just make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| It's not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| I have looked at this and given a lot of thought about the 65-57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| And I think back to the gentleman who was here last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| And he works in, I think, public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| And it's a fairly physical labor-intensive position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| And he's not certainly at the high end of the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| As a matter of fact, he conceivably could be making $392.30 a week when he retires based on some of these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1099)|
| 0:18:27| So I'm thinking that there is a cost involved with some employees going to 65 in order to be eligible for retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1107)|
| 0:18:40| The cost being that physically some of the jobs are much more demanding than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| And so we can't have physically demanding and, you know, not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| But it concerns me that we could have people who might not be in the best of health as they are in some of these jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1130)|
| 0:18:59| and that we would have an increased number of accidents, illnesses, disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| that would offset any savings that might appear to be the case in this three-year age difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| So that being a serious consideration to me that we do not, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| the accidents that we've had have been in public service in the most serious injuries over the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1158)|
| 0:19:29| Is that correct, Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| I believe the most serious recent accidents have been in public service, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| And a lot of those jobs, you know, are just really, really extremely physically demanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| And as a carpenter, 65 and going on a roof to nail or whatever, I'm just real concerned that 62 would be a reasonable age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1183)|
| 0:19:53| There would be nothing to prevent someone who chose from working longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| So if I was in reasonably good health and I wanted to work a little longer, I could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| But if I was not or I was just tired, I could leave at 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| If I could make one other comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| In the general government, the change, as Dr. Lyons indicated, from rule of eight at 62 is a very substantial cost change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| 62 is also much more representative of what an average retirement age is within general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| Within the fire and police, the change from 50 to 55 is also relatively substantial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| particularly combined with the change in the basic multiplier, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| So, you know, 55 and 62, I think, is a little more consistent with industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| But I certainly leave it to your discretion to do what you feel appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| I would certainly be more comfortable at the 55 and 62 range in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| Last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Now, what is the current retirement age, Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| It is, right now, for general government, it is 62 with the rule of 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| which means if somebody starts at 20, they're retiring at 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| So that's, you know, with 12 more years of retirement, or could retire at 50, and 55 for police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1282)|
| 0:21:31| Excuse me, 50 for fire and police right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| That's fairly substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| So, you know, where do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| Do we want to vote on the recommendation, or do we want further discussion on it, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| Why don't we just go through all the items, and then we can come back, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| We're slowing it down, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| I'd be more comfortable if we settled one before we went to the other, because as I've watched us discuss some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| things, we can really get into the weeds in a hurry and then forget where the path was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| And so, from my perspective, Councilman Grieve, you look stunned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| Again, you know, I would just be more comfortable if we had one thing settled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| but that's part of my orderly learning style that we talked about in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| With all due respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| No, part of my problem with going item by item is that, as you know, I did not vote for this plan to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| And so now we're talking about voting one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| What I would prefer, because I may end up voting with you, Council Lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| but I want to know what all the pieces are instead of just doing it a piece at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| In other words, there may be some pieces in here that may put me over on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| And, by the way, I do want to say I want to thank Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| and I want to thank Alan for answering my questions, which I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| That was a great help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| It really did help me with the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| But I'm having, Vice Mayor, I'm having a little bit of a problem just sitting here kind of voting on one thing at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| when I'm not sure what the overall plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Well, I guess my response to that, these are straw polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| I mean, these are not binding polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| But we're going to sit here from now until Christmas if we don't start getting some things down on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| And, I mean, we've had numerous workshops, and we could have numerous more workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| But if we don't, you know, so we talk about every item and then come back and vote how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| What do we do after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| I mean, that's my whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Just like what Councilman Delivoki said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| It's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Well, I mean, I just think that we need to start trimming the items down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| I mean, we decided last, at the last meeting, that we're going with the, you know, the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| Straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1431)|

| 0:29:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| I'm going to say yes in the light of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| I'm going to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| That was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| This is the easy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| 63 is the most unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Vice Mayor, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| You had voted on the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| There was not a discussion specifically if the 10-year service requirement was acceptable or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| So I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I see Mr. Saunders shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Is everybody okay with the 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Isn't that the vesting years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Well, there's two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| There's two different issues because right now there's a five-year vesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| but you can retire at age 62 even if you don't have five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| So I was suggesting that those two be connected so it would be 60-whatever, 63 and 10 in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| But I just wanted to have that point of clarification before we moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| If you have only nine years, you can't retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Under this, well, if you make it 10, then you wouldn't have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| then nine wouldn't be there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| No, it would be 63 and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| If you have less than 10 years, you get a refund of employee contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I'm anticipating the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| I was just going to make an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| As we go through all this, we may design a camel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| That kind of concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| A three-hump camel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| And then for the fire and police, won't you go ahead and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| Right now the initial proposal is age 55 with 25 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| But if they do not meet that requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| then they could go out under the age 62 and 10-year requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| So it's whichever one of those gets them there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1869)|
| 0:31:17| Currently it's age 50 with 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| So that would be the initial recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| And the Wallace Amendment is 57, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| And the Wallace Amendment is 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| I propose 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| But the recommendation that you brought forward is 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| That was the initial recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| 55 and 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| This is on 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Well, can I say this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| It's what he's proposed, but I originally went back on March 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| seems like eons ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| We talked about 57 with 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| So that's how I got to 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| And I think that's, I don't know, but anyway, that's really what I'm going off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| That's kind of what we've talked about, and I'm just back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| That's how it came out, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| So we're talking about two here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| We're talking about two numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| We're talking about 55 and 57, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Councilman Wallace, is that what you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| So do we want to vote 56 or do we want to go through the exercise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| I mean, seriously, I mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| If we could raise hands, it would be faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| It just seems like the way to do it, I mean, you have your five that supported the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| and then out of those five, if somebody wants to make amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| that seems like that would be the easier way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Well, we're all in it together, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| I mean, the five is nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| I mean, we've all got to come together on what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| So we're trying to do what's fair and best, you know, for overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Why don't we go with 56, and if that doesn't fly, we can go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| 56 it is, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| I was holding out for 57, but I guess we're done because we're already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| We've already got five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| We're already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| We'll go with 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| I mean, is that a yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| We already had five, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I just thought people might want to go on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| Vice Mayor, it's the recommendation with the one change of using 56 instead of 55 on the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| May I continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| The contribution credits, which is sort of the driving force for the cost and the accumulator and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| had been set at 8% contribution for general government, 10% for fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| with the assumption the employees will be contributing 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| Although I did not put the employee contribution as a discussion point anywhere in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| if you wanted to include that, this would probably be the place to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| But the 6% would be employee contribution, 8% general government, 10% fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| I approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Are there concerns with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2124)|
| 0:35:32| Well, I'm concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| I'll approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| I think it's a very rich plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| There's some disagreement with that, but I think this is a very rich plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| Yeah, and just for the record, I mean, I just sort of want to explain my thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| I mean, this is a plan that, I mean, I think it's pretty clear that I'm not for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| And I don't plan on voting for it, so I don't want to get down to the nuts and bolts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| I mean, I think it should be up to the people that are planning on supporting it to figure out what their plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| So that's why I'm doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| I'm not trying to impede or anything, but that's where I am on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| and that's why I don't want to push you guys to change your plan and then I not vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| I just didn't think that would be respectful to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| So, in a way, I'm trying to be respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| I mean, you have your five, at least your five, that are supporting this plan and perhaps others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| But, I mean, I just don't plan on supporting it, so I don't want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| lead you all to believe that I will by negotiating on all these different numbers, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| Well, you know, you threw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I think it makes a little bit of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| But I think, like Councilman Wallace said, I mean, I hate we're getting hung up on five fours or five whatevers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2212)|
| 0:37:01| I mean, we voted, you know, with the straw poll to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| And I guess my hope, just as a city member of council, that we would have continued to have dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| but we've got to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| And, you know, I understand if somebody doesn't support it, but, I mean, it's still open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2236)|
| 0:37:25| I wouldn't discount everything that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| I mean, that's what we're doing is crafting what the majority of the members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| and I would just be my hope that we'd all contribute towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Councilman Della Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| I don't have a problem with these contribution credits, the 8 percent and the 10 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| in a defined contribution plan because that kind of makes the pot healthy in terms of making retirement possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2263)|
| 0:37:53| I guess my question is, if we're in a combined plan with defined benefit and defined contribution, either blended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2273)|
| 0:38:01| or at least option of picking the highest one at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| I kind of wonder if the employees shouldn't be given like 6.5 percent or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| slightly higher to the extent they're going for a defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| But that being said, if that's the majority view, then we'll go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| I just think for a defined contribution plan, 8 and 10 seems fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| And I don't have a problem with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| So, let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| I mean, I think we've started down a path, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| I mean, I'm seeing a lot of shaking heads, but I think we should still vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| Mr. Vice Mayor, can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| I understand where Marshall is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| I'm not comfortable with this, but I do agree with Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| We have to come with something, because at the end of the day, whatever we put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| we need to do all we can to make sure that that is passed by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| If it's not exactly what I want or what anybody else wants, I'll understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| But it's so important that we make some adjustments here as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| Now, will these be the final adjustments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Maybe in some years we'll come back and visit this issue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| I don't exactly know where this is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| And that's the reason, even with discomfort, I will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| And I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| I think that's what my hopes for the process would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| And we're not, you know, we've still got plenty of opportunity to discuss the numbers and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| but we've got to, you know, this was the chosen plan by the majority of members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| So, Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| Vice Mayor Patlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Yes, if we go to six and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Kind of more of a no, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| It's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| I know we've been here about 40 minutes and we were hoping to get through most of these tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| I was trying to skip around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And now I'm thinking maybe I better just dig right through and go on 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| No, let's do as we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Number seven, the drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| The drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Yeah, we'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| The drop is being taken out of the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| We do not have a drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| One of the desirable characteristics of the drop is to get a portion of your benefit as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| I put a recommendation in under the new plan that a member eligible for retirement could elect to receive either 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2466)|
| 0:41:15| or 10% of the value of their benefit as a lump sum option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| This is not an additional cost measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| This is simply to provide members with an opportunity to get a portion of their benefit as a lump sum, which does two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| Number one, it gives them the opportunity to take a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| To the extent they do, it actually moves some of that risk back to the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| How does it do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| How does it move the risk back to the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| You just took a figure out, the 5% or 10% that would ordinarily grow over the 20 or 30 years of retirement out of the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2504)|
| 0:41:53| So we have the assets to grow to pay that annual payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| How does it lessen the risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Let's say somebody had $200,000 at retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| I'm just making numbers up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| And let's say they decide to take 10% of that as a lump sum, $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| Well, if their monthly benefit would have been $20,000 a year, now it's going to be $18,000 because they took 20% of it as a lump sum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2528)|
| 0:42:18| which means now the city is only responsible for managing the assets associated with the $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| So $180,000 now goes into that risk pool, not $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| This creates a relatively smaller risk pool of assets for the retired population to the extent members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| And that works even if they opt for the defined benefit portion of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| Well, they're not going to opt for the defined benefit or defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| I mean, one of them is going to provide a larger annual or monthly benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| Whichever one provides the larger monthly benefit, that's going to be the basis for their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| But then once that is determined, then I can figure out, well, what's the value of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| Is it the account balance or if it's DB, what's the value of the DB benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| And I'm just saying, if you elect a member, have a portion of that, 5% or 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| which I consider to be relatively small of their total benefit, that it's a benefit to the member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| It doesn't have additional cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| And it somewhat reduces the total amount of risk to the city once the person retires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| Because their benefit level drops down based on the amount that's in the pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| But, you know, if you had over a series of years, you had $500 million worth of people retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| and everybody elected to take a 10% lump sum, then at the end of that period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| you've got $450 million worth of assets to manage and worth of risk to have instead of having $500 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| So it just reduces the asset pool, which by default reduces the risk pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| And is there an employee demand for a lump sum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Is that why you get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| I mean, how do you start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| How do you get to this option as opposed to just leaving it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| It is very, very desirable for most employees to receive some portion of their benefit as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| That's part of the reason the drop plan has been desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| It's part of the reason people like participating in G-1, because the G-1 account balance is available as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| In the DBDC-MAX, the D.C. account is not available as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| I mean, this is, you know, the idea is to convert that to an annuity and provide a guaranteed lifetime benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| So I was just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| This is the trip to Tahiti or the remodel of the kitchen, as you would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| I mean, if this is not, you know, if this doesn't seem desirable to the council, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| I was just offering it up as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| I was trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| I like the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| I propose 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Hearing no other, we'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| It's up to 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| I was suggesting it could be 5% or 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| I mean, if you want to just limit it to 10%, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| But I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Up to 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Up to 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| An option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Yeah, it's just an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| It's cost neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| And I can see it being a real benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Somebody would like to have some early cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Up to 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Cost neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Looky there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| How easy that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Let's do that one again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Yeah, let's do that one again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| I mean, that's the whole process tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| I mean, that's the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| We ready to move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| We're going to skip the in line of duty for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| We'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| Let's look at number nine, early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Again, this is not meant to be a significant cost item either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| This is more of a practical matter of how we're going to handle early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2765)|
| 0:46:16| Under the current plan for General Government, somebody with 25 years is probably looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2776)|
| 0:46:24| at the rule of 80, not at early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| But previously, if you had 25 years, you could take early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| retirement, general government, fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| I'm just suggesting in the new plan, if somebody works 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| it might be reasonable to allow them to take an early retirement benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| The 4% per year reduction I'm recommending isn't exactly actuarial equivalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| but it's close to being cost neutral and it's just easy to understand, easy to administer, so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| So that anybody that worked to, on or after age 50, that had at least 20 years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| under this recommendation could elect to take an early retirement benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2822)|
| 0:47:12| Councilman Delma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| How did you get to 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| I mean, why that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| Under the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| It's pretty young to me, but that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Yeah, it is pretty young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| If somebody works 20 years from age 30 to 50, they're not going to have near substantial value in their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| They're still going to have a 4% per year reduction for general government for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| So you're talking about a 48% reduction in their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And yet, if somebody wants to take $5,000 a year at 50 rather than $10,000 a year at 62, that's not a significant cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2857)|
| 0:47:47| It's just more of a, you know, it's more common to allow early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Now, if you want to put early retirement at 55 and 20 for general government and 50 and 20 for fire and police, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| I was just trying to suggest something reasonable to start out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| If not, Ms. Wilson, call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| I voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| No, but I'll take a higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| No, but I'll take a higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| So that one passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| That passed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Yes, it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Item 10, termination prior to normal retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| This provision is very similar to how the current plan works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| If somebody terminates employment prior to being eligible for retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| they can currently take a refund of employee contributions with interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| and then they would forfeit any future benefit in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| I'm suggesting that the same type provision apply in the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| Let's say I have ten years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| I'm vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| I should be able to get, you know, the value of my employee and employer contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| Well, if you put that provision in, that's an additional cost to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| and that's not consistent with the current plan operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| So I'm just going to think this point was significant enough that I wanted to give the opportunity to consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| But the recommendation is that it worked the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Unless you're eligible for retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| your only option is either to defer your benefit to the point you are eligible to retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| or take a refund of employee contributions and forfeit any future potential benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| Councilman Delfo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| This is the word normal retirement, but really you could you'd have to read in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| or early retirement under Item 9 that you just said was 50, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| If they were not eligible for early retirement when they terminated, then they're not going to age into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| The early retirement is you have to be age 50 when you terminate and have 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| Once you're 50, you can take out your share and the government's share of the funds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| Once you're eligible for early retirement, then you can take a monthly early retirement pension, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| So normal retirement doesn't mean the 62 and the 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| It means or early retirement if you qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| I mean, I guess I can clarify the recommendation and say prior to being eligible for retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| if that's more acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3074)|

| 0:51:46| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| Item Number 11, I'm just suggesting that the current optional forms in the plan, with the exception of the drop benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3112)|
| 0:52:01| of course, the current optional forms, such as the joint survivor with or without pop-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| certain in life, that we just use the same optional forms in the new plan as the old plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| Again, this isn't a cost item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| This is just more for administrative purposes to make sure everybody's on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| This just lets you separate whether you want to take it all as the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| or split it with the survivor if you die first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| It's a pre-deceased clause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Part of it's a joint survivor, which you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| There's also a certain in life benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| So if you took a certain in life and died within ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| then your beneficiary would get the remainder of the ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| There's a cash refund option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| So if you elected the cash refund option and died before you received the value of your benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| then the remaining value of that benefit would go to your beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| It's the same optional forms that are currently available in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| In other words, you agree to take less because you want to have a survivor benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| Yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| My only problem is what are all the optional forms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| I don't even know what that means, but all optional forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| The all optional forms would be, for example, 50% joint survivor, 100% joint survivor, 75% joint survivor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| with or without a pop-up feature, the pop-up being that if you elect 100% joint survivor with a pop-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| and your spouse dies, then your benefit moves back up to the life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3211)|
| 0:53:39| But it's cost neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Yes, it's cost neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| This is just more administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| I just want to make sure everybody is okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| Mr. Wilson, call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3230)|

| 0:53:56| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3236)|

| 0:53:58| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3238)|

| 0:54:00| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Item number 12, normal form of benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Currently, in the general government, when you retire, your benefit is defined to be a life annuity for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| remainder of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| You can elect an optional form, as we were just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| Currently, in the fire and police, if you're married, the normal form is a 50% joint survivor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| So, if you elect a different optional form, it's based on the 50% joint survivor, which is a relatively more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| beneficial benefit form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Under the new plan, the recommendation is that it would be a life annuity both in the general government and the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| So, that 50% joint survivor subsidy in the fire and police would no longer exist in the new plan under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| What was the 50-70?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| So, right now it's 50%, but what you're saying is that the survivor will get the full amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3309)|
| 0:55:09| Now, let's say that you retired in fireplace today and your benefit was $20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| And you said, okay, I'm going to elect $20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| Five years later, you pass away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| That form of benefit, the normal form without making any other election, provides 50% of that, $10,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| for the rest of your spouse's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Now, you can elect a 50% joint survivor in general government, but there's a reduction to your benefit in the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| government to make that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| In the case of the fire and police, currently there is no reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| In fact, if you want a life annuity in the fire and police and you're married, you can elect a larger benefit than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| the benefit formula would otherwise supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| So, it's an additional subsidy that's built on to the current fire and police benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| You're doing away with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| So, what you do is you elect a 50%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| No, you get a life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| You get a life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Or you can still elect a different optimal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| It's just a lower amount under this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| So, if you take the 50% or the 70%, you get less than the full benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| You get less than the $20,000 a year in my example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| You might get $18,000 a year or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3382)|

| 0:56:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Actually, I've got item 12 twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| But the bottom of page 3 is the defined benefit formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| And let me clarify that what I was really doing, I didn't put a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| The whole basis for the DBDCmax is this 2% of pay formula at some break point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3432)|
| 0:57:20| The break point is a different discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| So, this is not the item to talk about the break point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| It's a different item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| We'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| This is just basically saying the formula is 2% of pay times, you know, limited to 40,000 times service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| It was really a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| I wasn't even really asking for a recommendation because if you don't accept this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| it kind of brings into question the entire hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| So, I guess unless anybody has discussion or wants to make a comment, I would just move on to the next point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| I think I understood what you just said, Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| But you're saying don't get distracted by the 40,000, which you haven't talked about, which was item 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| So, you're saying 2% of whatever number we end up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| 2% of pay, which is going to be capped at some number, whatever we come up with, yes, times service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| How many years of service do you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Service under the current proposal is not limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| So, if you had 40 years, it would be 80% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| 80% of limited pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| You know, if you make $30,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| You don't look at the last three, five years, that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| The final average earnings was proposed to be five-year final average earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| So, it would be five-year final average earnings, 2% of five-year final average earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| That's what we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| Right now, it's two-year average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Right now, it's two-year average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| You're talking about a five-year average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| So, that's kind of the basic formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| But then, since you're only talking about the DB portion, the dollar limit comes in to trigger how much of that is the DB value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3527)|
| 0:58:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| And that's the thing we are deferring discussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| I think I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| That's item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Yeah, we'll come back to the $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| I just wanted to at least document the benefit formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| Councilman Zana, no line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Mr. Wilson, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| We don't need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| Yeah, I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| I mean, you can call the roll if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| But if we vote no on that, then we're going to have a lot of discussion about where are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| It's been the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| I was just being consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| I mean, if there's no dissent, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| There's no dissent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Item 13, 10-year vesting is recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| No problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Any discussion on that 10-year vesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| We've been talking about that since day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| I mean, I would just highlight that for any employee that's coming to the city that doesn't plan on being here 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| there's basically no retirement benefit for that employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| I just think we should take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| This is supposed to be a recruitment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| So for someone that's not planning on being here 10 years, this isn't going to help recruit that person at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| And there could be substantial funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| For someone that makes $50,000, $5,000 a year, the city, if they work in fire and police, that's $5,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3626)|
| 1:00:34| Say they quit after nine years, the city will have put in $45,000 that they'll have no access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| But, I mean, it's just I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| I just think that we should all understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| The flip side is that the person is setting aside pre-tax dollars in a savings plan that they're getting the benefit of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| and they're going to get interest if they decide to take it out and not stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| So they're not being punished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| I mean, they're making an election that has a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| Vice Mayor, just as a point of clarification, as part of our five-year experience study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| one of the items we looked at is when people terminate, even after they become vested, what do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| Do they leave their money in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Or do they take a refund of employee contributions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| Almost, without exception, people that terminate before 45 or 10 years and 10 years of service today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3681)|
| 1:01:30| even if they're vested, they take a refund of employee contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| So if they're vested or not vested, even now after five years, they could leave it in the plan and they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| So, I mean, whether you want to have five years or ten years is, you know, at your discretion, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| But I'm saying as a practical matter, most of those people take a refund anyway, particularly if they're younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3706)|
| 1:01:54| I think that's what, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Well, that's what speaks to this whole pension plan to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| That's why you want people to stay on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| You want to give them a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| I mean, by 10 years, fire and police, they're well trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| They're hopefully been promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I mean, or any general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| I mean, that's the whole idea, that they will stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| And that's their incentive to stay, to get the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| I mean, that's why you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| And, I mean, that's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| You want to give them a reason to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| And that's what we're here to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| I mean, I think that's really what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| That's the carrot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| And I think it's wisely used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| I assume that's 10 years for fire and police and general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Distinction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| Do we need to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| Is there dissent amongst?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| I mean, with respect to Councilman Starr's comments, are we good to go on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| Title 14 is another sort of administrative issue, but it's one that I did want to bring to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| When a member gets to retirement with a substantial account balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| and says, what is my monthly benefit, I've got to go through a calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| I've got to make assumptions about interest, mortality, COLA, all those things in order to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| with an appropriate conversion factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Now, the recommendation I'm making is to look at the assumptions that have been adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| and are being used in the valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Those assumptions are reviewed every five years to keep them up to date to make sure they're appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| which means that if the assumptions for the conversion of the account are consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| with the assumptions we're using in the valuation, then you do not expect to have long-term gains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| and losses from the conversion of those accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| If you use something other than those assumptions, then you are going to be building in either gains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3828)|
| 1:03:56| or losses into the future operation of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| The recommendation is to just use the valuation assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| Just a question, is there any way to make this calculation transparent to the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| so they have a clear understanding of what they might expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| I can create a table of factors that say, if you retire at this age, your conversion factor is 14 or 15 or 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| So, they could say, if you retire at 62 from fire and police or from general government, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| the conversion factor, you know, might be 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| So, if you have $130,000, then that's $10,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| I'll be happy to do that as an administrative matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| We don't now convert balances to an annuity, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| In the G1, members do have that option, but that's a little different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| You're talking about annuitizing retirement at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| And the COLA becomes related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| In the assumptions, assuming we had a zero to 3 percent, I'd be assuming a 2.5 percent future COLA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| and all likelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| And so that would be built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| The cost of that would be built into the conversion factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| So that would be reflected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| Once the council's pleasure, are we comfortable we need to vote this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| I don't think I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| I don't think I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Well, then let's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| If somebody retires and has $200,000 and say, what's my monthly benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| Then I have to come up with some sort of conversion factor to take the account balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| divide it by that factor and say, well, that's equivalent to this many dollars a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| But is that an estimate or is that annuitized and therefore guaranteed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| That's what I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Once it becomes annuitized, it becomes a guaranteed monthly benefit to the member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| And you have to assume in that process what the COLA is or the investment return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| I have to assume future mortality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| When is somebody going to die?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| I have to assume future investment return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| I have to assume future COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| All those factors go into creating that conversion factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| And what if we adopt a COLA formula that says cost of living up to 3 percent in the discretion of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| if there's money in the pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| I mean, how do you figure that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| What number can you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| The valuation assumption is going to be some explicit number in the valuation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| and that's going to be reviewed every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| So you just do your experience study like you do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| And if it turns out that it's two or two and a half or whatever, then that's the number you end up using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| And if you've been using a higher or lower number, you adjust every five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| How does it affect the annuities that have gone under the bridge in the first five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Once it's converted, it's converted and that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| Okay, you convert it and then you, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| And you just adjust over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| I think I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| We're comfortable with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| We move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| Item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Before I think we all know what the break point is at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| Before I tell you that the recommendation is 40,000, if you didn't have a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| I would turn you to either the valuation report or the e-mail I sent around earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4053)|
| 1:07:41| The average pay in general government is, this was as of the 2011 valuation report, so it's a year old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4061)|
| 1:07:49| But at that time, the average pay was 42.8,000, almost 43,000 in general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| and about almost $47,000 in the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| So the total average in the city for all general government fire and police employees is $44,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4080)|
| 1:08:09| So the 40,000, I think, is a, it's going to cover a lot of lower paid employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| and give some good protection, I think, to those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| To your average employee and your higher paid employee, the 40,000 is not going to give so much protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| So my recommendation to have something that would be relatively meaningful to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| some percentage of your population would be to use the 40,000 for all members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| Councilman Delbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| What I understand is that the average age of our employee base in general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| or fire and police is what, 45-ish, 40-ish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| What are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| In other words, you said the salary was 42.8 for general government, 47 for fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| What's our average population age, if you will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| There's 522, I guess, police and what, 340 firemen or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| I think I've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4150)|
| 1:09:21| Actually, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| I don't have the exact number in front of me, but I think you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| For the general government, well, for both, it's probably early mid-40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| Early to mid-40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| And what about folks in the service group there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| Not community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Fire and police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| No, it's the service group in general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| I just wanted to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| David Brace Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| We were talking about those because the gentleman was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Yeah, I don't think I have further breakout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| Is that younger or older, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Police tend to be younger, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| Police tend to be on the younger side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| And I would think that the public service team would be more like the general government, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4206)|
| 1:10:14| Yeah, I would say, well, the average policeman's salary is a little bit higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| and I would infer that the average policeman's probably a little older than the average fireman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| Well, or their step increases are bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| I mean, that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| But, I mean, the point I was making is that even though your current employee's average compensation is up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| into the 40,000s, those are people that are mid-career on average because it's the average of everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| which means if you looked at everybody that was just within five years of retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| generally the longer service people are going to be, not always, but generally higher paid people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| Do you have the average pay at retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| In other words, we have a number that's comparable to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| I don't have that in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| You expect it to be higher, I guess, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Now, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| What's the average pay for an individual working in Knox County or Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| What's our average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Like 44,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| Oh, in the entire county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| I don't have those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| I don't have any idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| Isn't it 34,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| I think 33 to 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| I think that's household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| That's household, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Oh, that's household?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| You had some numbers in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| You compared us to Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| That was household income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| Is that a census number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| I don't think we have those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Well, what you're trying to get at here is you're trying to get 60% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| You're not trying to give them 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| You're trying to give them 60% of 40,000, which is only 24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| So that's, you know, and if that number is less than their defined contribution rate of return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| and so 24,000 in this case, that's the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| That's what they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| They get 24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| They get $2,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| So, I mean, it's not 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| We're not trying to pay them 100% of their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| And then it's capped at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| So if you earn 60,000, it's capped at 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| And if you only make 35,000, it's at 35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| So it's you're just trying to get them 60% of their, you know, of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| And I think 40,000 is fair and, you know, 24,000 a year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| You know, I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| I mean, I move to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Doesn't it depend on whether it's indexed also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| I took that $24,000 figure and took a 15% income tax rate from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| So that meant the person would actually get $20,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| And that would come out to $1,700 a month or $392.30 a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| It's not very much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| So I think that for us to reduce the amount lower than 40,000 would just be not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4392)|
| 1:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| I was just asking that it seems to me we need to look at item number two with item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4403)|
| 1:13:31| Isn't it if we index it, that means we're going to increase it every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| May I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| Indexing, unlike the COLA, where future indexing is a cost, the indexing of the break point is not creating an additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4420)|
| 1:13:51| The indexing of the break point is to try to keep the cost stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| and to try to keep the amount of protection, relatively speaking, for your lower paid employees approximately the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4437)|
| 1:14:07| So, for example, if you did not index it and 20 years later you still have a $40,000 base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| and your average pay is $60,000 a year or whatever, I mean, that's you're just not helping anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| because nobody is making those levels anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| So if the objective is to keep the risk profile, which is currently about 50-50, relatively stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4462)|
| 1:14:31| then you would want the break point to approximately keep track with the cost of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| or your increases in your average salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| So I would suggest if you do not index the break point that within a relatively few number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| it becomes relatively meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Yeah, I was just going to say that using modern technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| there's something called citydata.com, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| It gives the, again, median household income, and that's not individual income at 31.9, so call it 32,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4499)|
| 1:15:07| For Tennessee, 42,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| It has a per capita income of 22,000, but that assumes children work and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| It's just divided in numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| So I guess that's all we have is the household income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| But the number we have here seems higher than what the taxpayers are earning on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| And so I wonder if the break point shouldn't be lower, more like the 32,000 or 34,000 or 30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4525)|
| 1:15:32| or some number like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| May I comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| I'm just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| The $40,000 indeed may be higher than the average income for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| Ultimately, of course, the benefit that's going out of the plan, if that $40,000 limit applies to Ms. Palmer's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4544)|
| 1:15:52| it's a 60 percent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| You know, your average employees are making what they're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| If you set the break point at $30,000, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| it's rarely if ever going to apply to anybody and you might as well just get rid of it, which I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| part of the purpose of the plan was to provide some additional protection for your lower paid members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| So if that's still an objective, then I think $40,000 helps achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| But if that's not an objective, then, yeah, take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Well, reducing it to $35,000, you reduce it from 24 to 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| So you would only be paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| You're saying you're just multiplying by 60 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| Yeah, just take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| I mean, I just don't, I don't, we're going to get to the indexing next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| So I still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Maybe we should talk about the indexing because that really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Is it some automatic thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Is it something done every five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| What do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| Yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| The indexing, as I have recommended it, rather than having just a CPI, consumer price index of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| 2.3 percent times this and 2.5 percent, and then you get some harried number out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| is to apply the index to it, have an unrounded amount kind of over here on the shelf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| round it down to the next $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| So it's $40,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| Then at some point it would be $41,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| And then at some point it would be $42,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| So each year, if the CPI is 1 percent or 2 percent or 3 percent, whatever it is, and then you would round it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| So every year you would have a new indexed amount, a new rounded indexed amount that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| or might not be equal to the prior year's amount depending on what the adjustment to the CPI was for the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4648)|
| 1:17:37| Doesn't that increase a whole big unknown into this whole analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| Well, we don't know what the pot looks like because it goes up automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| So if we have a year with 10 percent inflation, are we going to bump up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| I guess I would suggest if you --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| I mean, that's going to be tied to the level of salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| So you could as easily say, if we don't know what future salaries are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| we don't know what the ultimate cost is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| But if part of the break point is going to be, you know, tied to salaries, then I think it makes some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4683)|
| 1:18:10| You know, you may not know where either one of them are going, but if they both go the same direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| at least you're having a consistent division as you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| Or at least that was the, you know, that was my thinking in proposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| And the CPI has no max on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| In other words, you don't say CPI up to 3 percent or some number like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| Yeah, I mean, my thinking was that if inflation goes up 2 percent or 4 percent or 5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| to the extent your salaries, you know, I would hope over the long run would keep pace with inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| perhaps with even some modest growth, you would want the break point to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| And wouldn't this eventually morph into essentially a full defined benefit plan rather than one that's got protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4727)|
| 1:18:56| at the low end and a fine contribution on the higher end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| I mean, I guess if it was the board's desire, you could say you're going to index it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| It's CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| But such, you know, amounts shall never exceed the average salary of current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| I mean, that would guarantee that it doesn't overtake the plan, you know, where it's primarily defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| Yeah, because, I mean, if it morphs into a defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| then we're right back in the soup that we started out with, which is something that we may not be able to afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| If the council desired to index it forward with a $1,000 rounding such that the break point could never be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| than the average salary of current fire and police general government members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| that would guarantee that that did not, in fact, happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4781)|
| 1:19:50| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Well, I think that originally when we first started talking about this, being able to control the lever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| I said I propose that we come back to council and, you know, every year we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| I'm still kind of in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| But, however, also a year comes around pretty quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| and I think there ought to be some way to kind of quantify what we're going to do and what the formula is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| I kind of like that last revision there where it's no more than the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| You're going to be able to kind of keep some controls on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| I just like the council having control of these levers, you know, the ones that really cost us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4825)|
| 1:20:34| And that one there is the ones that really, you know, could cost you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| So, I kind of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| I like that little, that kind of swayed me over there, the addendum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| So, I kind of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| But I think there ought to be some kind of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| You can always go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| If you're having a great year, you can always go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| So, I kind of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4853)|
| 1:21:02| I was just trying to understand it so that I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Would you repeat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| I think I understand it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| Well, yeah, I think I tend to agree with George with that last twist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4868)|
| 1:21:15| Otherwise, I would like for council to vote on this periodically, whether it be every year, every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| There's got to be some set, something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| And we need some guideline as to what we would be looking at, not just kind of wide open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| whatever we're thinking at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| So, this does provide a little bit of protection on the upper end so we don't fall back into that bucket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| that we find ourselves in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Well, a 3% raise every year rounding down would basically, if you maxed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| I mean, this is so you're $1,000 a year rounding down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| That's where, you know, 40% and you go up to 41 and your maximum 3 go to 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| I mean, it basically keeps you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| I mean, it's pretty slow growth, but that's the cap is keeping it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| Now it's 3 to 6, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| I mean, it's a lot higher than what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| So, but I like that last twist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| I can also live with the last twist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4934)|
| 1:22:14| I guess my concern still remains that we're taking out the piece that Councilman Wallace started to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| which was that if councils confronted in a world where there aren't dollars to do this in a particular year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4941)|
| 1:22:34| we've given up in some automatic world the control over the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| And again, we start to get away from how do we be fiscally prudent when everything's out of our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| and in a world of black wells, people will say, well, you adopted the index, you're there, so tough noogies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| I mean, it's the problem that we started out with when we talk about the big picture that we've put aside for now is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4974)|
| 1:23:02| can this be a runaway train, this breakpoint thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| So maybe that last fix does it with no more than the average salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| But I think about that because that starts to let it get out of your control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| and all of a sudden fiscal planning becomes harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| I think Mr. Delvaux makes an excellent point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| and I would be happy to recommend to revise my recommendation to say CPI rounded down to the nearest thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5002)|
| 1:23:29| with the proviso that the breakpoint may never exceed the average pay of the general government, fire, and police group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| I think that's very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5016)|
| 1:23:49| Does that leave us with a COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| Does that leave us with a COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Do you want to take those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Yeah, I mean, do we want to lump those together as a --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| I at least want to understand it because I think that's -- is everybody comfortable with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| I mean, well, we probably want to vote this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5045)|
| 1:24:14| I don't hear a lot of dissent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Yeah, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| I mean, you know, philosophically, I guess I've been not for this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| but what I don't understand is that if the average pay for city employees, both fire and police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5063)|
| 1:24:31| and general services is $44,000 or $44,500 and we're basically providing a benefit package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5071)|
| 1:24:41| a defined benefit package for employees up to $40,000, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| it just seems to me that we're putting ourselves in the same situation that people did 20 years ago or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| I mean, we're not -- I don't understand how we're going to end up paying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| And, again, it goes back to what I asked the last time in terms of how we're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| Because what we're doing is it seems to me that we're guaranteeing our employees a retirement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5102)|
| 1:25:10| a defined benefit plan up to $40,000 with certain increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| and we're putting all this -- we're really putting the burden on the taxpayer again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| The taxpayer is the one that's going to have to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| And we already know what we have to put in this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| and we know what we're going to have to put in next year and probably the year after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| And so are we really helping the whole situation in terms of an equal balance between the city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5128)|
| 1:25:36| and the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| And the taxpayers are the ones, you know, that are out there that are going to have to foot the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| And so, again, when I see that the average pay is $46,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| and we're going to pay a retirement benefit up to $40,000, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| It's not --| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| We're paying it up to $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| Yeah, the retirement benefit is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| I mean, I keep saying 60 percent and that assumes 30 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| So, if they've got 15 years of service, you know, then you're talking about 2 percent times 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| So, it's, you know, 30 percent of pay, not 60 percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| So, you know, we've got we're focusing on all these career employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| and there are a lot of career employees, but there's a lot of people that terminate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| with less than 30 years too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| So, using the $40,000, I do think, gives a minimal level of protection for your lower paid employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| who need a lot more than the higher paid folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| So, you know, if that seemed to be desirable, then that's a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| If not, then, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| You could just as easily say it's $40,000, but it's $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| You could, you know, you could say it's $24,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| but it's reduced proportionally if they have less than 30 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| Your last, but your last, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but your last, the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5214)|
| 1:27:01| would take care of that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| The amendment would take care of the concern of the plan becoming primarily defined benefit in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5224)|
| 1:27:12| I mean, even providing the base, you know, $40,000, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| The city is on the hook for some risk for the employees that retire, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| that have the defined benefit plan as their predominant plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| But the $40,000 is actually, we pay out $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| And that's based on if you work 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| We want to, you know, I hear what you're saying as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Taxpayer is still on the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| It's a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| Is there a 60% cap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| Under the current plan, there's not a cap on the year of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| They work, I guess they'd have to work 50 years to get 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| They work 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| I guess they'd get 120%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Yeah, I think there's a 415 limit that prevents you from getting more than 100% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| There's a dollar limit, a legal dollar limit in the plan that no matter what you can't get more than 100% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| I'd be for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Somebody works 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| You wouldn't get it for very many years, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Councilman Grieve, is that a whole lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5301)|
| 1:28:28| So do we, I think we probably ought to vote this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| Do we want to combine item one and two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| Take them in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| Take them in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| That's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| So leaving the break point at 40, that's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| Recommendation is 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Mr. Anderson, call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5337)|

| 1:29:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| So could you, I'm sorry to have you one more time, summarize your proposal on the index?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| On the index, the initial recommendation was to use the consumer price index,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| round it down to the next $1,000, and then the amendment to that recommendation was that the break point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5377)|
| 1:29:45| can never be more than the average pay of the current fire and police general government population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5385)|

| 1:30:24| Yes, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5424)|
| 1:30:42| Is it ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| We're looking at the cost of living, item six, page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| Currently, as you probably know, the cost of living adjustment is based on the CPI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| such that the resulting benefit adjustment may not be less than 3% or more than 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| The current recommendation or the current assumption was that the COLA would be based on the CPI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| not less than 0%, not more than 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| After having some discussions with council members that said they were concerned about that cost of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5476)|
| 1:31:23| getting going up and up when the city couldn't afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| I had offered the following recommendation, and that is that if the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| and when I say the plan, what I mean is the bucket of assets that have been accumulated for the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5493)|
| 1:31:40| If the assets available are less than 95% of the liabilities that have accumulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5500)|
| 1:31:48| then the full COLA amount would not be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| If it's between 80% and 95%, only half of the regular COLA, whatever it would have been, would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5512)|
| 1:32:01| If the funding drops to less than 80%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| one-fourth of the COLA that would normally be paid would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| If the funding is 95% or better, then the full CPI COLA limited to 3% would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5531)|
| 1:32:20| And the council could, at its discretion in the future, if there were several years that the plan had been less than 95%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| funded, if it desired to do an ad hoc COLA at some point in the future to make up for smaller prior COLAs, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| they would always be able to do that at their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| But the primary core of this is CPI zero to three with limitations as described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| if the plan does not stay at least 95% funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| So, taking the plan, the assets in our plan right now, what percentage funding are we based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5568)|
| 1:32:58| whatever the assumption is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| I don't know if it's six and a half or seven and three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| The current funding is approximately, I think, 78%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| So, under the current plan, they would get one-fourth of a regular COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| And that's at seven and three-eighths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| I believe that's correct, yes, under the last valuation that was performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| You recommended here that the council may, at its discretion, provide an ad hoc COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| Does that be on a yearly basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| No, it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| Ad hoc just means at any time in the future that the council desired to revisit the COLA issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| felt that retirees had gotten behind because COLAs had been smaller than expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| they could come back and make an adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| So, this really, the ad hoc isn't really tying you into any future action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| It's just saying at your discretion, if you wanted to do something in the future, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| What about in the other direction if you thought it was too high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| Can you reduce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| Is that a one-way street or a two-way street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| No, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Once a COLA has been given, you could not go and reduce it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| You can't say, well, the plan is 120% funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| Yeah, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| You can't reduce a COLA that's been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5661)|
| 1:34:33| Is the first retiree under this plan 10 years out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Because you have to have 10 years of service, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Or you're withdrawing, effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5681)|
| 1:34:56| Mr. Stegg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Does the COLA, so the COLA goes up and down or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| The COLA would always be between zero and 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| It goes up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| I mean, it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| It's always a positive number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| It's not a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| You know, when you say down, you wouldn't have a negative 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Even if the CPI was negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| you wouldn't have a negative adjustment to people's benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| But if one year it was, say, 2.5% and then the next year CPI is 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| It would go 2, 1, 2, 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| Down between zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| It goes up and down between zero and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| So, it's maxed out at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| I mean, if CPI goes to 5, it's maxed out at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| So, if it's at 1, it's at 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| That's a little more complicated, you know, than what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5737)|
| 1:35:46| But, you know, I think it keeps it in range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| It keeps it between zero and 3 at the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| You know, I'd like to be voting on it each year, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| I guess that's but I don't know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| Wouldn't you do that at budget time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| You do that at budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| You know, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| Because you're about one month before the end of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| You know sort of where you are when you hit the budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| I mean, you kind of know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| It lays it kind of subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| I think the fear is it lays it kind of subjective if you don't have a formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| I don't know of a better formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| If you can come up with a better formula, I'm certainly willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| I mean, I'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| After spending, I guess, an hour and a half with nine of us working on numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| I think I don't know if I'd like to have that vote every year of trying to decide between 1 and 0 and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| I think a formula is not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| You like the formula and then that way you'd know what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| With a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| With a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| I mean, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Dr. Lyons, anything you need to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| I was just clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| I think a formula would probably be a better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| And as Mr. Pinkham pointed out, if we have a period of time and the retirees are really down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| and then suddenly we have boom times, there could be a one-time council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| The mayor could include that perhaps in the budget or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| But I think that a formula helps retirees better understand where they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| and what they'll have as opposed to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| And some councils might be very generous and others might be very frugal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| Councilman Delbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| Yeah, I'm sitting here scratching my head thinking it's taken us, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| eight or nine meetings to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| I'm wondering how many voters are going to understand any of this if this is on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| And I realize they're going to get 200 words and not all this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| There's enough complexities here to confuse the average bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| And I kind of worry about how you explain this in a way so that you have an actual intelligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5880)|
| 1:38:07| voter reaction to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| And I understand that by their nature pensions are complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| I guess it makes me wonder about the divine contribution approach just because you know what you're paying into the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5895)|
| 1:38:23| And if you have a good year, you could actually throw extra dollars in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| But you're never at risk of knowing what the market is or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| It is what it is and you don't have to sweat at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| I mean, I wonder what the voters will understand as they look at this brief explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| and then the percentage, the small percentage, say 25 percent, go to the website and try to read the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| I wonder what they're going to learn without Alan sitting next to them explaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| Well, he's going to work that night, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| You're going to sit with them, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| I was just going to offer one other piece of information for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| Even if the board, even if the council decided to vote on the CPI COLA every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5940)|
| 1:39:08| if they had a pattern of approving the CPI and then decided not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| there have been court cases where the court said, well, you've approved it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| It's essentially automatic COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| You no longer have the right to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Whereas, if you build the formula in, it is what it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| So I think you get some additional protection from that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Your explanation, I must say, was very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| And given whatever assumptions we come with, and if we come with a lower assumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| we're going to find currently that we are not funded so there would be no COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| In other words, we'd be less than the 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| You said we're 78% now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| Well, I guess what I should clarify is I think we've got the current bucket of assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| and liabilities over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| I'm trying to use that as an example, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Yeah, I mean, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| Under the current scenario, yeah, we'd be starting right off with a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| I understand that's going to be a different bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| So as confusing as that is, that's not going to appear on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| It's going to be a very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| Yeah, there's going to be a statement that says we'll close Plan C and G or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| And that we adopt a hybrid kind of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| And it will have some features, I guess, we'll try to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| Maybe that it shares market risk and it's a choice between two pots or something, depending on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6031)|
| 1:40:38| Mr. DellaVolpe, the current language is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| Very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Close the current plan, put in a new hybrid defined contribution, defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| as it's described in, you know, Charter Amendment, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| But it doesn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| But don't you have to estimate costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Usually you have to estimate costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| You have to estimate costs if you're going to amend the plan to improve benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| You say, well, what's the additional cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| But not if you're going to adopt it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| No, because there's not any immediate additional cost impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| It's just this is what we're doing for new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| So the voter doesn't know whether this is going to be expensive downstream or inexpensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| Yeah, we're not putting cost projections and saying, if you do this, this is the cost in 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| No, that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| With the little things that we've done today with age and this and that, how does this look now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| I mean, will there be some kind of run that you make that kind of incorporates whatever changes we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6084)|
| 1:41:29| There haven't been any changes that would materially impact the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| I can go back and rerun it, but I think you'll find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| What's your definition of material, 5 percent, 10 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| What's material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Yeah, I mean, if the long-term cost is 8 percent, you know, to me, material is more than plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| or minus 50 basis points or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| I mean, relatively small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| 50 basis points being a half a percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6110)|
| 1:41:58| I was just going to make one point, I think, that I'll ask Alan to make sure I'm correct on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| But, really, the COLA, especially with folks now retiring earlier, what it is now is the huge cost driver in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6123)|
| 1:42:11| I mean, as big as any of our factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| I think the reduction of the COLA we're talking about is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| especially given to what we have now is very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| Yes, I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| That's the biggest driver is the COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| I mean, the biggest driver probably is the multiplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| But after the multiplier, probably the COLA is the next biggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| The multiplier of the 2 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| What's the multiplier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Well, in the current plan, I'm thinking, you know, the current Division C plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| you say what's the biggest driver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Because we were saying that the COLA in the current plan is driving most of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| You know, the 2.5 percent fire and police multiplier is driving a lot of the cost as well in the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| In the new plan, it's really a combination of the 8 percent, 10 percent is really the basis for the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| the contribution credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| That's really the contribution rate that you put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Plus the additional amount you put in if there's a defined benefit risk in terms of market events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6185)|
| 1:43:12| Yes, the combination of those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| But primarily it's the 8 percent, 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| That's the big driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| I was thinking of, I mean, we had an agenda item, and I don't remember what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| but we do our pensions on an automatic kind of vote, a consent vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| and we had about four or five of them last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| One of them was a 50-year-old police officer who had put in 26 years, and so he met the rule of 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6210)|
| 1:43:38| And my memory was that he would retire at roughly, and, of course, you know, he abided by all the rules in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| He earned the pension that he got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| My recollection was that he would start at $34,000 a year in his pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| And if he's age 50 and lived 30 years, I calculated it out using, because I'm not real good at math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| 3 percent each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| And by the time he was 80, he was getting paid $84,000 or $5,000 a year, and it was $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6240)|
| 1:44:07| And so we had to have enough money in the pot to pay $1.6 million over time after he retires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6247)|
| 1:44:15| You're talking about something a little different, I guess, the annuity that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| I don't know whether you buy it from an insurance company or whether you just take it to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| No, it's self-funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| And you self-fund it in the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| Self-funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| But it was about $1.6 million it added up to if you looked at the person living to a normal age of, say, 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6268)|
| 1:44:35| I mean, that was a sizable sum of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| Are you saying you like or don't like the current recommendation for the COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| No, I'm just trying to think of, you know, how do you contain your costs in, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6284)|
| 1:44:52| Well, I think our point is this contains the cost way more than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Starting later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| And they're compounding at a much lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| Instead of a floor of three, it would be CPI capped at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| So that would make your example that you used, that same person under this scenario would not get anywhere near that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| And so the question I'm struggling with as I sit here thinking, are all these levers effective to protect us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| or are we smarter saying just go with a straight defined contribution and know that we're putting in 8% and 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| and the market risk is what it is, but it doesn't hurt the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| And that's why I keep asking myself that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| I guess the more protections we put in here, the less risk we put on the taxpayers and that's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| but there's a way of avoiding that and that's just paying money into a pot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| and it's the employees to take with them whenever he leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| I mean, there's that option and I keep struggling with what's the better way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| I know you can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| I'm struggling with it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| Well, I mean, the one thing that has been influential in my thinking is the example that I gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6353)|
| 1:46:01| at one of the prior council meetings where, you know, in a defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| you have the shared mortality risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| So maybe you've got half the people living longer and half the people living shorter, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| so if everybody had, you know, a half a million dollars in their account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| and you gave everybody a life annuity of $50,000, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| half of those people might live more than 18 years, let's say the 18 years that he's expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| and half might die sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| What's the 18 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| Where did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| Life expectancy for a retiree, let's say at 62, so age 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| Oh, but not the 55 or the 56?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| Yeah, I'm just making up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| 62, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| Yeah, I'm just making up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| You're saying 80 is probably a normal age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Right, so that's a normal age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| So if everybody has a half million dollars saved, then the plan with reasonable assumptions might be able to afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| everybody a $50,000 a year benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| Where if that person had a half million dollars in a defined contribution account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| and took out $50,000 a year that lasted 18 years, then half those people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6416)|
| 1:47:03| if they manage their money well, which is another issue, might have enough money to live on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| The other half are not going to have enough money to live on because they're going to outlive, you know, the 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| You're saying on average A lives longer but B lives shorter and so it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| The key in a defined benefit plan is that you share that mortality risk so that for a smaller pot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| you can guarantee people a lifetime benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| Then, you know, if I was retiring at 62 and I want, you know, enough for $50,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| and on average I have to have $500,000, then I probably really want a million dollars to make sure I don't run out of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| So in a defined contribution account, to get the same standard of living and same security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| So you need a bigger pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| What about when you throw in the survivor benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| Doesn't that moderate so that everyone lives about the same age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| Yeah, I mean, the whole point is if you have 1,000 or 2,000 people to share that risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| then you have some people living longer and some people living shorter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| but it takes you less dollars on average to provide the same monthly benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| It's just more efficient to do in a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| The big problem that I believe that resulted in the situation we're in is taking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| assets that were backing $400 million of inactive liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| and investing that money as if those people were still active, which created more volatility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| which as long as the volatility was up, you know, life is good, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| High tide floats all boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| That's the thing in the investment world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| So my suggestion in going with a hybrid plan, we're moderating risk by sharing the risk between the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| and the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| I also have been recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| and will continue to recommend new investment and de-risking strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| regardless of what defined benefit plan we have going forward, to further mitigate the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| We don't have control over that, so how does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| In other words, it's a separate pension board that decides that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| and right now they've got 20% of the money in hedge funds and, you know, other alternative type of investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6540)|
| 1:49:08| Well, I think Mr. Saunders is going to have a few things to say about that in the next little while anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| Actually, the pension board, and I have to commend Alan, two years ago, three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| you brought this up, and the pension board, as best I know, has not taken any action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| but we are beginning to look very seriously at just exactly that, de-risking, getting that volatility down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| For instance, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| You don't gain as much, but you don't lose as much in the bad years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| Because if you're not, well, what the net effect initially is that it increases our liability that the city has to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6576)|
| 1:49:46| In other words, when you reduce your assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Have you cleared up yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| The point is, that's exactly the goal is to get that down to where we really can manage it without the volatility we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| currently experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| So you're saying as you lower the return assumption, you obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| the obligation to pay in money increases because you've got a shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| Right now, that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| But long term, once you get the funding stabilized and the volatility stabilized, then you can work within a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6611)|
| 1:50:18| Modulate the risk to a lower range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| So the pension board is looking very hard at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| I had a question on the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| You've been saying that this plan is estimated at 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| How did you come up with that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| A bit more than half of the liability is inactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| And something like half of the liability, they're older people, but that amount of risk is being taken on by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6641)|
| 1:50:48| whereas all of the risk for the active liability, not all of the risk, but a large percentage of the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| is being taken on by the active employees to the extent that their account balance ultimately provides that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6654)|
| 1:51:02| I did not have a plan formula or a, you know, I can't give you A plus B plus C that I came up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6662)|
| 1:51:09| It's really an estimate just based on many different factors that go into the overall risk model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| But it's true that it seems like this plan, the real risk is with the retirees, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| So the real risk is going to come sort of like the situation we're in now when we have more retirees than current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6682)|
| 1:51:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| For this new plan, it would take quite a long time for that to happen since we're just adopting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| But that's where the real risk is for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Not the $40,000 floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| I think as you have more inactive people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Was that as you have more inactive or the other word for that is retired people than active workers, that's when the risk increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6711)|
| 1:51:59| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| Well, what happens is, I mean, to me, you know, I'm not in favor of this plan because I think we could put another council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6720)|
| 1:52:08| right in the same position we're in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| And the way that happens is the employee's benefits are based on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6730)|
| 1:52:17| So if they are employed for 20 or 30 years and there's strong market growth through those years, their benefit goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6737)|
| 1:52:25| It's not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| It goes up with the market because they'll have an account and it's going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| And once they retire, if you get a large group of retirees when the market's up, then their monthly benefit is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6750)|
| 1:52:39| And I spend a lot of time looking at this plan and really feel very uncomfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| But then it's set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| And, of course, this wouldn't happen for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| I mean, it's going to take 10 years for one person to vest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| And then before they retire, I mean, probably all of us, including me, will be long gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| What could happen is you could have a large number of employees retire in a strong market, say the 1920s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| Then you'd have the 1930s where there's a big market downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| Well, those employees, their benefits is set when the market is high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| So that's where the real risk is in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| The $40,000, I think we've, you know, established that that's a floor and there's some risk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| But the real risk is with the retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| So, you know, I just feel uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| You know, putting a future counsel in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| And maybe it would never happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| And maybe, you know, you can do things to mitigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| But I think that risk is there because the benefit is not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| I mean, it can go up as high as the market goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| And then if the market goes down or there's a couple decades of slow growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| you're going to have serious, serious unfunded liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| And to me, you know, listening to all this, I just think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6825)|
| 1:53:52| we're drinking the Kool-Aid mix of predictions, estimations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| and assumptions that got us into this mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| We're adopting a plan based on 6.5 percent, but our 10-year return is 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6841)|
| 1:54:08| The other issue I wanted to bring up and, you know, why I'm against this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| and one of my concerns about it is it's supposed to be a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| This is supposed to attract people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| It's so complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| Mr. Stare, I'm sorry to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| No, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| I'm making a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| It's so complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| I just don't know how we're going to explain it to new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| I've been trying to explain it to people as I talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| And it's so complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| I mean, we're talking to a new employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| We want to say we've got this benefit and hopefully they understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| I mean, when you start talking about annuities and this floor and all these different factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| I just don't know if it's that much of a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| And especially a lot of employees these days, I mean, the market chains are not just career employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| The younger generation moves around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| So, if they're looking at a benefit that they don't even --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| It's not portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| And they're not going to have access to it unless they stay 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| I mean, that's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| To have no retirement benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| And if you think about sort of the eight-year cycles when people come in for four and eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| none of those people would have access to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| And maybe that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| But to me, is it really a benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| And the other thing is, you know, as soon as they leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| the current system, they have incentive to stay because every year they work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| they get 2% more of their salary once they retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| Well, now, this system, it's not really set to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| So, there's not really that great of an incentive to stay either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| So, to me, it's a very expensive plan, and I'm just not sure it's worth the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| You know, I think you've got your floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| If the market does really, really well, I don't see it going below 8% and 10% even though that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6946)|
| 1:55:53| So, that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| And one question I would have for council and the administration and the employee groups is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6956)|
| 1:56:02| would we want to consider to make this optional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| The administration would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| An optional retirement plan is not, I think, viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| We'll recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| Yeah, I was just going to suggest, I know we've got two more items on the list of levers to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| I know it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| We've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| If the council desires to revisit the issue of whether or not you should support a hybrid or DC plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| then, of course, that's your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| I thought I was hoping to actually finish these points before we get out of here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| And I think we've discussed this one thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=6996)|
| 1:56:40| Mr. Wilson, call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| Well, let's talk about what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| Do you want me to restate the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| The recommendation is on the cost of living that it be based on the consumer price index,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| not less than zero percent, not more than three percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| that a full COLA would be provided if the plan, the new plan bucket of assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7018)|
| 1:57:04| if that new bucket stays at least 95% funded, if it's 80% or actually less than 80%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7024)|
| 1:57:12| then you get a fourth of the regular COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| So, if it would have been 2%, now you only get a one-half percent COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| And if it's between 80% and 85%, then you get half of whatever the regular COLA would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| When do you get zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| If the CPI is zero or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| Not if it's grossly underfunded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| Under this recommendation, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| In other words, you don't have another category that if it's below 60%, then there's no COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| Is there any reason why you couldn't have some other lever in there that in your index?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| The presumption, my presumption, perhaps it's not right or not, is that under the future pension boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| assets would be invested relatively more conservatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| It's much more likely the funding would stay between 90% and 110%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| If the council desired to put a 60% lever in there to say if the plan gets less than 60%, there's no COLA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7081)|
| 1:58:09| I think as a practical matter that would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| if that happens then people haven't been following a reasonable investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7092)|
| 1:58:21| But why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| I mean, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| If it's zero to 3% and we never have a zero, that doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| If it's underfunded by that much, they wouldn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| I mean, the CPI was negative a couple years ago, so, I mean, it could be zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| But, yeah, if you want to, you know, I'd be happy to revise the recommendation and say if it's less than 60%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| then you get zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| I don't have any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| I like the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| That's where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| I mean, and that's what we're trying to prevent is to try to prevent that as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| Employees are, you know, you invest in employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| I mean, that's the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| You're trying to keep them and retain them and grow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| And, I mean, this is the value of the city is employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| That's what you've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| That's what they're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| We have 1,500 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| It's our asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| And that's a big part of your budget and it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| I mean, that's what services, you're here for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| But I think I like the amendment where if we're less than 60% funded, we don't, there's no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7153)|
| 1:59:19| you know, even if the CPI increase was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| You're presenting that as the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| I present that as the Wallace amendment, as you all have termed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Wallace plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| You get a house with this when you retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| If you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| 20% you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| You'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| The last item on the agenda is the in line of duty disability benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| The in line of duty disability benefit in the general government essentially says whatever benefit you have earned to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7216)|
| 2:00:24| your accrued benefit, if you become in line of duty disabled, you can get that amount as a monthly benefit the rest of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| That's not a particularly generous in line of duty benefit, but that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| I've recommended using the same thing in the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| In the fire and police plan, if you become in line of duty disabled, you get 50% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7240)|
| 2:00:46| It's a lifetime benefit for the rest of your life, regardless of what age you were when you became disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7246)|
| 2:00:52| That is, next to the basic retirement formula, that's the most expensive benefit in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7252)|
| 2:01:00| If part of the desire is to reduce the total cost of the plan, this is one place that costs could be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7260)|
| 2:01:09| Part of the issue is in the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Part of it is in determining what does in line of duty disability mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| If the council desired to leave the same basic definition of in line of duty disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7276)|
| 2:01:22| but wanted to modestly reduce the cost, you could award a 50% of pay benefit, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7282)|
| 2:01:29| for a member that was in line of duty and also social security disabled, which most people consider to be a higher criteria of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7289)|
| 2:01:38| disability, whereas if they were not social security disabled, but determined still to be in line of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7298)|
| 2:01:47| you might provide somewhat relatively lower, perhaps a 30% of pay benefit rather than 50% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| Now, you know, you don't have to pay within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| This is something that some plans carve out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| They hire an outside consultant and say, you're going to be responsible for determining what is in line of duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7320)|
| 2:02:07| and what's not based on these criteria, and it keeps that decision from being made where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7327)|
| 2:02:14| internal forces might affect the outcome of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| You could leave the provisions exactly the way they are under the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| or you could do something different, but this is a significant cost issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| and I felt if we were reviewing all the provisions in the plan that it would be very appropriate to consider that provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| and put it before you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| Yeah, I'm trying to understand this because obviously police and fire put their lives at risk and their bodies at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7361)|
| 2:02:49| and obviously disability is a legitimate concern, and we have to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| I didn't understand the difference between the social security disability versus some other kind of disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7375)|
| 2:03:03| and how you adjust that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| I mean, is one the inability to perform your specific profession but not work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| I mean, what are you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| The social security, in order to be eligible for a social security disability benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7392)|
| 2:03:18| you have to apply to the Social Security Administration, meet certain relatively strict criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| and then if you are deemed to be disabled based on that criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| you would get a disability benefit from the Social Security Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| Regardless of age, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| Regardless of age, yes, and then under the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| if you were deemed to meet those more strict criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| then you would be deemed also to get the 50 percent of pay rather than the 30 percent of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| in which case even though you're considered in line of duty disabled, you still may be able to perform another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| You just may not be able to perform the job that you were currently in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| You might be a desk guy or something after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| So you'd have two tiers, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| Three percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| In terms of the current in line of duty criteria, Mr. Cherry is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| and he can talk to that more specifically if you're interested in hearing more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| I do not understand all the criteria that goes into it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| And then your recommendation is what, the two tier or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| Yes, that's my current recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| You said there's a significant cost for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| What are we talking about in terms of cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| If you took the disability benefit out of the plan on the fire and police expected cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7469)|
| 2:04:36| it might reduce the total cost by close to 2 percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7476)|
| 2:04:42| So the long-term cost for the fire and police, maybe rather than being 9.5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| might be between 7.5 and 8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| So it's a relatively significant portion of the cost within the benefit structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7490)|
| 2:05:01| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| If you're charging into a building after the bad guy, you don't got to be thinking 50 percent, you know, disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7502)|
| 2:05:08| I mean, you got to go do your job and you agree to take certain risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| And I think it's important for the city in those situations where we have a disabled worker to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| certainly to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| They give their health and their life, you know, in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| So I don't know how you would carve it completely out of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| That doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| I guess I understand your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| On the two tier, you would have a guy who's basically lost his police career entirely because he's really badly injured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| or fire career, or even some other career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| But in another case, he might have had a disability where he can't be a motorcycle cop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| but he could be a, you know, forensic cop in an office or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| There's a situation where you're still employable in your line of work, but it might be defined slightly differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7554)|
| 2:06:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| And you might charge, you know, Mr. Cherry, Mr. Gilbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| to come up with some distinctions that were appropriate to meet those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| In terms of figuring costs, you looked at the 50-30 for fire, police, and the what did you use for the general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7571)|
| 2:06:19| Actually, for general government and fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| I assume that the disability benefit would be an immediate payment of whatever the value of their account balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| or their defined benefit, monthly benefit was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| So the 30-50 or the current provisions, either one, would increase the projections that I previously provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7591)|
| 2:06:40| It would increase the projections you provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| The projections I provided did not reflect the current disability benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| And so when you graph those lines in terms of what the cost was, that was not in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| And you would bump it up 2%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| Or would you say no, more than 2%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| Yeah, one and a half, 2% if you did the current provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| Well, even in the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| Actually, the one and a half, 2% is just one and a half, 2% of payroll for fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| So the total cost might be 1% of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| And even if you had a defined contribution plan, you'd have to have some kind of disability insurance that would protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| people who are hurt in the line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| I mean, that would be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| Yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| Either plan is going to have that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| When you said carve it out, what did you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| Just that, insure it separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| You could go to an insurance company and buy a disability policy for the employees that provided a similar benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7648)|
| 2:07:36| and just pay premiums where it was, everything was independent of the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| You just sold that risk to someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| So it doesn't have to be part of the pension plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| Many times it is because many plans consider it less expensive to self-insure than to go out and pay premiums to an insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7671)|
| 2:07:58| company where you're paying expense ratios and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| But, yeah, I mean, if a group did not want to have the responsibility of determining who's disabled and who's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7683)|
| 2:08:12| you could just say, look, we're having a disability policy and the insurance company sets these criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| and they determine if you meet the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| And even though it might be more expensive, the benefit of not having to make those individual determinations in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7699)|
| 2:08:29| cases might be desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| Now, does this actually reduce from the current plan what you're recommending now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| Does it actually reduce what a person would receive in terms of their disability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7722)|
| 2:08:47| Yes, for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| On the general government side, the accrued benefit under the new plan would be relatively smaller than under the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7729)|
| 2:08:55| And since that's the basis for the disability benefit, you know, the general government benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| even though it's the same basic formula, would still be relatively smaller just because the overall benefit structure is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| relatively smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| But on the fire and police side, if you stick with the current 50% of pay, that's not tied to the account balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7748)|
| 2:09:16| That's not tied to the $40,000 minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| That's not tied to anything else in the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| It's just sort of, okay, regardless of anything else we've decided, we're also going to provide a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| if you stick with the current provisions, a 50% of pay disability benefit for the fire and police members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7768)|
| 2:09:37| I'm just not too comfortable with reducing any kind of disability benefits for fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| I mean, that, you know, if it's the council's desire to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| I just wanted to bring it to your attention that that was a significant cost item within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| I didn't want that to come back and be a surprise later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| Councillor McGrady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| Thank you for bringing that up because I kind of agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| But what is it that we have right now for the fire and police and general service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7798)|
| 2:10:03| Fifty percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7803)|
| 2:10:04| Fifty percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| Fifty percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| Or as a lifetime benefit upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| That's for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| In fire and police, not general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| And what do we have for general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| The value of their monthly accrued benefit payable as a life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| So if you've worked for 15 years and your monthly deferred benefit was $2,000 a year starting at 62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7818)|
| 2:10:25| then you get that amount immediately, I believe, after 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| You have to have 15 years in the general government to get that immediate life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| Otherwise, it's just a deferred benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| And with fire and police, who determines that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| That's subject to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| Yeah, subject to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| As far as determining whether a disability is given to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7847)|
| 2:10:56| Dr. Lyons, I mean, this is a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| I mean, obviously you all have discussed this with all the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| It could be for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| We have not discussed this particular item with the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| This is something that Alan felt like he should have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| I am not opposed and I don't want to go on record as being opposed to the current provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| I just want to go on record as saying this is a significant cost benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| and I just wanted everybody to be fully aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| I think it's a real financial lever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| Right, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| I mean, if pulling a lever and affecting long-term cost is an issue, then this is a significant lever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| Now, if it's the desire of everybody to leave it alone, leave it where it is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| I have no objection to that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| So I just wanted to be clear that I was just bringing it up as a significant cost component within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7904)|
| 2:11:50| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| You gave a percentage about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| Can you give us some whole dollars, what it would be now, if that's not too difficult?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7915)|
| 2:12:03| Yeah, the current payroll is around $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| So if we were talking about applying these benefits to the current plan, we're not, okay, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| But if we were, you know, 10% of payroll is $6 million, 1% of payroll is $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7934)|
| 2:12:21| So you're talking $600,000 to $1 million a year, long ongoing additional cost for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7941)|
| 2:12:32| and these are very round numbers, like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| If this is something that you want me to go back and put the pen and paper to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| and actually run more numbers, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| No, you don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| You've got the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| Yeah, that would be a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| So I guess the question that could for a million or a million and a half dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| could you go out and secure insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| That's really the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| Yeah, and I would not want you to go out and say, well, can I secure insurance for a million and a half dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| Because the difference in the million, million and a half is the basic disability provision of just get your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7982)|
| 2:13:08| accrued benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| So there's still a disability benefit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| But then the increase to go to a 50 percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| So the total cost of all that disability benefit might be relatively more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| But if you were going to really consider going out to an insurance company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| I would really need to go back and put the pen to the paper and give you some more detailed numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8003)|
| 2:13:29| I'll go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| Does this have to be in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| Can you set it outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| That's really my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| I mean, can you set it outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| Are we all comfortable doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| What do you think, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| I mean, are you all comfortable setting it outside the plan and not bound into the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| I don't want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| This is something, you know, the administration is not necessarily supporting what Alan's brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| He, you know, he is not just working for us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| He's working with you, providing you this more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| So, you know, we're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| I'm on my own now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| How do you like it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| We're going to show you how it feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8044)|
