| 0:00:19| Welcome, everyone, to the August agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=19)|
| 0:00:35| First, I would like to, I guess, acknowledge we have two new planning commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=35)|
| 0:00:44| We actually have three, but only two are present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=44)|
| 0:00:48| Rich Levinson and John Huber, so I hope you each give them a warm welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| At the same time, I would like, Rich, if you would start us off, just tell us a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| bit about yourself, what your career experience was, and glad to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:07| I've never given any talk that was short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| I've been in the real estate business over 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| I owned REMAX for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| We just recently sold it, so I do have a little experience in real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=79)|
| 0:01:26| My whole idea is private property rights, and that's why this is a really great place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| to be, and I'm honored to be a part of this and look forward to working with all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| all and learning how the system works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Glad to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| Secondly, we have John Huber here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| John, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Thank you, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Yeah, John Huber, and like Rich, Rich was the first guy I actually worked for when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| came back to Knoxville back in 1996, but yeah, I've been in real estate for nearly 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=115)|
| 0:02:03| Really merged more to the development side over the last 20 years, and yeah, again, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| looking forward to trying to help make some decisions and move Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| forward in a smart and progressive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| Thank you all for serving, and it's good to fill up our body again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| These eight, we had eight last month, so that got dicey whether we had a quorum or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| I'm going to turn it over to Amy Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| I just have a few updates, and then I will kick us off on our agenda items before turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| over to the rest of the staff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| Alcoa Highway, the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study was adopted by City Council and County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| There are a few next steps that have been identified as part of that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| I don't know what the timeline is going to be on those, but we'll be working with Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| and Knox County on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| So a couple of them include minor zoning and land use amendments, you know, as were identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| in the plan, and a recommendation that the City and County should engage in further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| around the creation of potentially overlay standards, and that the property owners themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| should work with Knox County and the City to explore any financial incentives or stimulus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| measures to assist new property business owners in getting themselves started along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:31| Our facts and figures document for 2022 is going to be released in the next week, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| please be on the lookout for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| It covers topics such as population and housing, cost of living, recreation, tourism, employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| education, and a number of other facts and figures included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| So it'll be on our website, and we'll be sure to send out a link to all the planning commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| Advanced Knox, we are still working with the consultants on developing out the scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| planning process and the next round of community engagement, which I believe we've announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| previously, but just to keep it on your radar, will be this fall in September or October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| and will be posted on this website, so I hope you have it bookmarked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| I had a request to provide an update on the appeals to BZA, the item that you all reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=255)|
| 0:04:24| in June, the status of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| It's currently before Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| The amendments as recommended by the planning commission were approved on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| but prior to the second reading in July, a revised amendment was introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| I don't know if you all can see this, I did send it out a couple of days ago, I linked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| to it, you can see it here, let me scroll down to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| So the section in blue is the revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| The revisions would allow anyone agreed by the decision of the planning commission on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| a development plan to choose where to file their appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| It could either go to BZA or to court, and the applicant for the development plan may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| opt out of the Board of Zoning Appeals process, if that appeal route is chosen, and have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| matter heard by a court of competent jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| And there's some requirements in terms of how many days the applicant has, that's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| identified here in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| And it wasn't determined that this revision was significant enough for it to return to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| So commission will hear it on second reading later this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| Anybody have any further questions I can try to answer on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=335)|
| 0:05:51| So moving on to agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| So Ordinance Amendment 8A.220A, it's agenda item number 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| This amendment was requested during the Public Stakeholder Committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| This committee, if you all recall, was convened to provide guidance to staff on the update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| of the city's zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Originally it had been called Recode Stakeholder Committee, and once the code was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| it was renamed, and they stayed together for, I guess, another couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| So we had a long list of amendments, which we've gotten through almost all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| This is one of the ones that was still outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| And several members of the committee and the public identified potential challenges associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| with the CG2 and CG3 application along Knoxville's major corridors, and specific to those challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=395)|
| 0:06:42| that were identified were the Build 2 zone and the Build 2 percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| And hopefully you all have read your memo, but I'll give you a snapshot of what I prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| So Build 2 zones and Build 2 percentages identify where buildings can be located on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| and are utilized to encourage a certain form along a street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| In the case of CG zones, they are intended to help create a more pedestrian-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| environment along Knoxville's main corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Most of the primary corridors in Knoxville are classified as major arterials, and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| major road plan, major arterials are identified as streets that provide major movement within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| the area and provide inter-community connections to local street system and move through traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| between activity centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Access control is desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| So in addition to reviewing the major road plan, staff also reviewed previously approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| land use plans and existing land use pattern along major collectors with the CG2 and CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:43| zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| And given the length of some of these corridors and the major arterial classification of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| and the existing constraint of certain sections of these corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| And here we're talking about, you can see the map here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| This is, and I will note, the reason we printed this out for you is I inserted this map in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| This was at the request of the city of Knoxville's law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| They thought that it would be helpful in terms of identifying, giving a reference to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| specifically in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| So we're talking about North Broadway, a portion of Maynardville Pike, Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| Chapman Highway, a portion of North Shore Drive, and a portion of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| So given the length of these corridors and the major arterial classification, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| think that the application of these Bill 2 zone and Bill 2 percentages make sense along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| the entirety of these corridors within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| And although the uses within the CG zone may be appropriate along the entirety of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| corridors, these major arterials in the city, the dimensional standards may potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| unduly constrain redevelopment if implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| And implemented alone, you know, the goal of the CG district is to create pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| And so, you know, again, implemented alone, these Bill 2 zones and percentages are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| going to create a pedestrian environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| So staff is proposing amendments to the code to refine the application of the Bill 2 zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| and Bill 2 percentages within the CG2 and CG3 districts to certain portions of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| corridors to encourage the development form that is desired by the CG district in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| areas with the highest potential for pedestrian activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| While not, you know, we want to make sure that we're encouraging redevelopment all along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| the corridors, but really focusing our efforts to create those pedestrian environments in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| areas that are not anticipated by the plans and other work that has been done by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| community to remain auto-dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Does anybody have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:54| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Amy, how did, I guess my specific question is regarding the section of east of White| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=595)|
| 0:10:04| Tower Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| You know, I guess the way I see that, a lot of that is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Why was that section included in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| And then there's also a part of the Greenway that's supposed to extend up, you know, North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| Shore Drive, hopefully, to Lakeshore Park, and wouldn't we want to keep that area CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| you know, the Bill 2 zone intact along that section, especially if the Greenway is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| to be going through there and making connections to Lakeshore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| Am I reading that wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| I mean, I might need to bring up the map here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| I might not have gotten...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| So if you'll notice, this is where it, this is where it doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=646)|
| 0:10:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| So east of this area, up towards Kingston Pike, is where the Bill 2 percentages and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| Bill 2 zones do not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| A lot of this area is unresidential, there's a lot of small lots along this portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Really, it was intended to capture the Rocky Hill area, which is already more of a, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| a real potential to become a walkable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| Is the map wrong then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| Because that area is highlighted on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| And it could be that we need to tweak the title of this particular map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| So it's the application of the Bill 2 percentages and Bill 2 zones in the CG2 and CG3, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| anywhere that's not highlighted, where it's going to apply, and is in the area that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| not highlighted black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| So if you'll look at the map, it says in the key, let me see if I can blow this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=703)|
| 0:11:54| excluded corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| So those corridors are excluded from being considered, or the Bill 2 percentages and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| Bill 2 zones are not included there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| That area is highlighted in black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| So they're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| No, it's really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| So but that section east of White Tower though, that's, so it's not going to be there, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| not going to have the Bill 2 zones in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| That's currently as proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| But why would you, I mean, okay, so isn't part of the Greenway supposed to extend up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| North Shore to Lake Shore, which included in that section of North Shore Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| And so wouldn't we want to keep the Bill 2 zones there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| Because of the Greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| I don't know that the Greenway alone would encourage, and given the current development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| pattern and the constraints of North Shore, I think it would be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| I mean, we're talking about buildings needing to be within a certain number of feet from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| the roadway, or from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| But we're going to be encouraging walkability to Lake Shore Park, and so therefore you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| removing the Bill 2 zones on that stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| That will not encourage walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| When you look at the purpose statement of CG, I think all CGs promote walkability, CG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:19| 1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Well, more so 2 and 3, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Because the CG 1, we didn't, I mean, that was the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| We allowed that parking in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| And the idea of the Bill 2 zone is to allow more walkability, the buildings being closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| to the street, slowing traffic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Yes, but we also look at the other component of CG 2 and CG 3, building heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| And so we just need to be aware of those building heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| I know that you and I had a fair discussion about that in the Bearden area when recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| was coming through, and we were concerned about the extremely tall buildings as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| So I think we need to have some concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| Even though there's a step back clause when you abut residential, but you have unlimited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| in CG 3, and I think 70 feet, CG 2, I think, working from memory here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| Here's the code up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Again, it doesn't, just because they don't apply doesn't mean that someone couldn't build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| between the zero and 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| It's not a prohibition from doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| But it has additional flexibility to allow someone to site the building where it's best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| suited to meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| And Commissioner, I'm not 100% sure maybe where you were referring to along, like there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| a lot of residential here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| I wouldn't anticipate that this residential would transfer to commercial any time soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| If it goes east of Prosser, does it go all the way north shore to Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| Yes, all through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Okay, so right where those churches are across from Sacred Heart, I think the plan was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| carry the Greenway along on that side of the road where that church is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| I'm not as familiar with where the Greenway was going to be sited, or I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Well, let's look at the Greenway where Earth Fair is, where the former Earth Fair was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=927)|
| 0:15:35| I'm not as familiar with the zoning in that CG1, so it's a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=935)|
| 0:15:47| Why, if it's all residential, why are we even proposing the change from east of Prosser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| all the way to Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| I mean, it's residential, it's churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| It goes through north of Kingston Pike, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| If you look on the map, it looks like it goes all the way to the interstate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| There's no sidewalk from Kingston Pike north on north shore to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=966)|
| 0:16:13| There is some sidewalk going south, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Part of this also adds between Westwood all the way east, no, all the way west, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=976)|
| 0:16:24| So, if you can go over to Westwood to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=984)|
| 0:16:36| Westwood's to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Westwood's right by the CVS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| The CVS at North Shore and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Where's Westwood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| It's right there by that CVS at North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| It's the road right by the Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| There's a bank right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Yeah, no, Westwood is further east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| It's further east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| I'm getting confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| So, all the way from Westwood is by the Firestone and in between First Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| Right there where Sutherland Dead Ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Amy, it's just east of the elementary school, Bearden Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Yeah, right, almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| So, there's Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| So, we're exempting everything west of Westwood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| There are sidewalks on both sides of that road on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| I see very little difference between the stretch east of Westwood all the way to Kroger and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:49| then the stretch west all the way to North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| I see very little difference in why we would change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| I'd agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| I was going to ask Amy, what was the rationale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Because the sidewalks end at North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Not going to North Shore with that instead of starting at Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Again, this is open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| If you all want to amend this, it is open to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| We understand from North Shore west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| Because there's no sidewalks after North Shore, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| So, it's, you know, the development pattern totally changes between there and then east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| of North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| And another section that I looked at was over in East Knoxville where we look at Prosser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| going east from Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| I guess one question is, when was this plan sort of put together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| Because I know the committee's been on Brown for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| And, you know, there's a Burlington kind of revitalization plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| Was that taken into account or is that a newer item maybe since this was looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| Because part of that plan, what the city's looking to invest, is a lot in sidewalks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| And if we cut it off at Prosser, it could change how some of those, so there's an entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| interchange project in the works right now there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| But there's some vacant lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| And I think if we change this to exempt everything east of Prosser there, it could really allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| some people to develop in a way that doesn't go with the vision of that specific area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| maybe a little further east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| And then, I mean, you're also, everything just right there is CH, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| Everything further east, there's almost no more CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| No, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Well, the whole idea is to allow for development that allows walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| And that's why we had that build two zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| But if we exempt it from Prosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Development's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| It's just a matter of where they can build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Well, and the vision of Burlington is to keep it walkable or maintain it being walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| But by eliminating the build two zone, you're not shifting in a direction where you're allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| more walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| I'm agreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| So, you're willing to add it, add on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| You're wanting to eliminate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| The extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| No, I'd say maybe a road maybe further east of Burlington be exempt instead of Prosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| I think CG1's getting a bad rap here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| You know, CG1 is, the same uses are in the, are all in the CG family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| And it doesn't say CG1 promotes less walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| All CG's promote walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| And this is probably an interim step to deal with, in my mind, there was a severe over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1246)|
| 0:20:57| application of CG2 and CG3 throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| If you go back to the history, the most commonly used zone in these areas was C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:13| And C3, CG1 deals more flexibly with the land because it uses the build two more as a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1273)|
| 0:21:26| rather than weaponizing it with CG2 and CG3 because then you have to pull the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| And because of these major, TDOT major arterials, and you see a lot of these uses that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1295)|
| 0:21:45| drive-thrus, once you get out beyond kind of that inner circle, or I call it, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| a band around downtown that we're trying to preserve as walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| But then, once you extend beyond that band, then you start seeing these uses, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| almost quasi-CH uses, but you, it's hard to get a drive-thru use in a CG2 or CG3 because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1323)|
| 0:22:14| you're pulling up, you know, zero to 20 feet and then you've got 10 feet of landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| and then you've got to have a drive aisle and then you can't have circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| So I think this is an interim step instead of doing a massive rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| This is just the best, I guess, strategy that's left to deal with the situation that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Director Brooks, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| I do think it's an interim step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| I don't think rezoning is a good approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| We have seen individual applicants requesting to go to CG1 because, you know, I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| a piecemeal approach is a good policy either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| So if there has been an over-application, which is what we heard, you know, from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| stakeholders, that's why I ended up on our list, is there a way to try to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| by tweaking the standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| And this is not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| This has been done in other communities as well, is to make the zones a little more nuanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| based on the roadway type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| I'd like to affirm what Chair Hill said, that this is trying to preserve the band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:32| So when I'm looking at the Chapman Highway component of this all the way to Young Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| is it a correct statement that that area has been looked at from essentially downtown all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| the way to Young High Pike, as this area has the greatest potential for walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| So we're trying to protect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| And then from Young High Pike on, there are some other options that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| I'll save my comments for Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| Is the map wrong regarding the, because I guess what I'm looking at is east of Prosser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1443)|
| 0:24:11| so going towards North Shore, that Build 2 zone is going to be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:19| Prosser's on Magnolia there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| I mean, not Prosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| What's the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| White Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| White Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| East of White Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| That section, the Build 2 is going to be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| As a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| It's not required, but you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| No, I'll say in that area closer to Kingston Pike, those properties have a lot of challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1478)|
| 0:24:47| Right now they've got a creek behind them that forces them to basically go towards the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| road anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| It's going to be challenging for them to actually build anything in the, on the east side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| I guess providing as much flexibility for somebody as possible in that area is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| And the properties on the west side of North Shore there have double frontages which challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| things too and they're not very deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| So I think that those properties in general closer to Kingston Pike are challenging to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| And I think given a little more flexibility it will be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Why then did you extend it all the way to White Tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| Why didn't you just put a little, like extend it to Lion's View?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| Oh yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| I guess we anticipated it just wasn't going to go to commercial in that area to White| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| So we just extended the line to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| We could shorten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| I mean, just, it's residential, I mean, maybe a few commercial properties along that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Commissioner Midas, do you have a recommendation that you would like us to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| Yeah, I mean, I would say just take it to Lion's View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| If that was one of the incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| The bill too is still required from Lion's View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| You know, I think that's inconsequential, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| I say that because almost every structure, just like Mike said, it will not be rebuilt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| because they're in the flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| From the stretch from Kingston Pike to Lion's View on the east side, I think almost, almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| everyone, you want to pull the flood map up and see if, we don't have a long agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| so we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Oh, you're asking me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| So, I mean, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I mean, but, well then why are we including that stretch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| And many of them are already pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Many of them were pulled up already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| If you look just south of Kingston Pike, they're already pretty close to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| If you back them up any more, they'd be in the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| The bike shop and the British pub and the old Wrangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| I just want to be clear what we're talking about, Commissioner Midas, so it's Lion's View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Actually, can I take that back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Can we extend it to Baum or, because I guess I would like to protect that area, that access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1643)|
| 0:27:31| area to Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| And I don't know if it really matters because there's going to be churches there, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| guess if they ever decided to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| The problem is none of it's zoned commercial right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| None of that's zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| A lot of it was IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Along the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| That's not CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| That's CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| So then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| I think we're getting close to deliberating and maybe we should just hear comments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| not start getting into what we want to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| It's more to ask director questions about and start instead of making kind of proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| That can happen Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Council agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| And I would recommend if someone doesn't, if we don't feel, if you all do not feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| you are ready to move forward with this on Thursday, if you don't have specific recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| for amendments for staff to make in order to send it on as a recommendation to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| I would recommend some other type of workshop rather than a debate about going back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| forth on individual streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| One thing I found helpful in looking this up last night is basically looking at where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| the ends of those roads are, the proposals where we're cutting it off, this requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:57| For example, the one on North Broadway, there's only like a handful of CG1 zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| Like when I was doing a quick glance count, like seven or eight parcels total that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| would even apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| So it might be helpful for the commission if we could have a count or almost like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| better visual or at least everyone just do their research on it to see what it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| But one thought for everyone to chew on is, I mean, it's kind of, we think this is like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| maybe an intermediary step of fixing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| But for Chapman Highway, for example, if we cut it off at whatever the proposed road is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| that is a lot of Chapman Highway that we are leaving to not build in a potential walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| And it's sort of what comes first, the chicken or the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| I mean, generally planning is planning for the egg so that we're not trying to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| out how to house the chicken later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| And so just kind of keep that in mind where we could be later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| I always appreciate a past chair trying to keep me in bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| However, I think this one is a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| It's so, I guess, I don't want to say maybe it is massive, that we need to really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1806)|
| 0:30:15| the boundaries and the effect of it before we go in and, I mean, this could take a considerably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| long time Thursday if we don't have the fundamental understanding of the boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| And I think it's important for each of you to get the concept of the boundaries and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| reach and the effect, because, you know, we're not necessarily experts in every facet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| of zoning, so we're trying to, I guess, get up to speed here on, and we have a relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| So I think it's good to have this open discussion, because it's a pretty significant revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1847)|
| 0:30:58| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| When's our next quarterly supposed to happen, or the next time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| It hasn't been scheduled, but we can put that on the calendar if you all want to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| I mean, this could change the landscape of a lot of things and impact things greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| one way or the other, and the market will then dictate what we're doing after that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| And I'm just observing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| I think everybody's got a lot of good points about where this thing ought to start and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| stop and what the ramifications are and, you know, even going into the fact that it'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| nice to include a stretch, but hey, to actually go do it, you've got to creep behind you in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| I think that this deserves some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| I would be for postponing this and trying to figure out when Jeff's going to schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| the next or whoever's the next person for a while and almost workshop it and go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| and just take our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Jeff, why don't you nod your head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| So are we going to put it on the postponed list and not talk about it Thursday, or are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:14| we going to bring it up Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| If you all would like to workshop it, we can schedule a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| And I'd like to hear, too, from the development community who actually deal with this on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| day-to-day basis, people like Tim and John and others who know the issues probably better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:31| much better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| I'd like to hear their two cents, because they're the ones who are going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| do this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Not that we should cave into them, but I think it's important to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:46| It's on the agenda, so it would have to be postponed or tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| So we're going to hear it and make the motion Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| It's already been placed on the agenda that's available to the public, so action will need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| to be taken on Thursday if that's what the body decides to do, an appropriate motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| for the public on that day in deliberation on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| You can add it to the postponement list for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2002)|
| 0:33:33| Agenda item number 38, which is another business item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| Hopefully you all have taken a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| So in order to comply with a new state law, these amendments are required for the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| And this is related to the dedication of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| And so pursuant to Tennessee Code annotated, the Planning Commission shall not require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| an owner of private property to dedicate real property to the public or pay money to a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| entity in an amount that is determined on an individual discretionary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| So unless there is an essential nexus between the dedication or payment and a legitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| local governmental interest and the dedication, it cannot be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| There's also something called the roughly proportional, both in nature and the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| of the impact of the proposed use or the development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| So your next question, I'm sure, is going to be, well, has it been decided when these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| dedications are going to be required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| And the answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| That is something that planning staff is in conversations with both city and county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| departments as well as their respective law departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| And so as soon as we have more information on how those will be determined, we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| happy to share those with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| It's very important that we move this forward and place it for state law and our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| And in addition, our major road plan will need to have language that refers back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| So that language has already been prepped and will be on your agenda next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| We just needed 30 days to be able to advertise that because it is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| This has huge consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| I don't think most people understand what this is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| I do not understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| You don't understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| I do not understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| I don't understand what they're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| So what, as I understand what state law is saying, is that we cannot, as a political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| entity, require the dedication of right-of-way along an existing road in the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| So the example would be, if you've got a concept plan, typically you would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| go ahead and show on that plan where you're dedicating a certain amount of right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| based on the major road plan, being a collector, local street, arterial, whatever it is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| there's different wits that are on that map that we all agreed to put down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| They're saying, I guess state legislators said that that isn't quite the way to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2150)|
| 0:35:58| because it's basically a taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| So we're changing what we've been doing because I've been on this commission 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| and I've always expressed the fact that I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| When somebody wants to build a house on a lot, automatically their setback goes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| 25 feet, which has been historically a 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| So we're reversing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| We're making it, but we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| So the cost to the community is going to go up exponentially because now you're dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:36| with multiple property owners instead of one to purchase because those lots are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| be divided along that street, and if you need 20 feet or 30 feet, and if you're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| federal funds to make improvements, then you have to go through the acquisition process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| that the federal government requires you to do, which adds additional costs and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2214)|
| 0:37:02| of acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| The cost to do anything is just going to be extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| So if I've got my developer hat on and I'm working on a project, I now no longer have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| the ability to confidently tell the persons who might be purchasing those properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| are right against that artery how much that right-of-way would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| If I could interject, so currently how it works is if someone submits a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| plan, they have to show a measurement from the center of the road to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| and if that doesn't meet half of the width, as Chris was saying, of the major road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| then we've been requiring it to dedicate, and so that's kind of been the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Going forward, if someone wants to submit a subdivision, at the time of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| we would determine whether or not a right-of-way dedication would be required based on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| essential nexus test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| And so what we're looking at is what would that essential nexus be, and so that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| thing that Amy was saying that we're working with the law department to try to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Is it based on a number of lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Is it based on safety issues like site distance or things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| When would we require dedication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| So the developers would learn during that process whether or not they'd have to dedicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| It's not something that would be passed on to an individual landowner unless some circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| were to change in the future regarding that area, like if we were coming through to Wyden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| But barring that, then there wouldn't be an additional right-of-way dedication required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| after the time of plot, if that makes sense, if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| So it would remain what the right-of-way is on the maps as they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Well, in a lot of cases, there is no dedicated right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| In a lot of cases out in the county, there is no dedicated right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| The right-of-way could be, and I'll ask Jim to kind of relate to Wayne on this, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:39:01| have a piece of property and you're on an out-in-the-county road, there's no designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Don't you all go from what, edge of the slope, edge of slope on the drainage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2347)|
| 0:39:16| And that could be anywhere from five feet away from the traveled edge or less, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| that's your right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| So you essentially just have a very minimal right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| On a residential road, like a minor residential road, our usual right-of-way is 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| In the major road plan, it goes up to arterials and major collectors and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| But when you're looking at a residential road, it may only have 25 feet of right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2380)|
| 0:39:48| So while he's getting his microphone to behave, that makes me think about the largest, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| of the largest complaints or issues that we'll see from community members is complaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| about infrastructure and our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Our road is only a hair's width wide and how can we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| How would this help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| It seems like this would only make that circumstance worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:20| It's a fine balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I mean, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution talks about compensation prior to taking, so there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| that, but then also the public works director in me says, you know, it's nice to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| right-of-way because we don't have to buy it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| So I can see it from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| We're meeting with Mike Moyer's and the law director's office tomorrow to kind of start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| talking through that, what that nexus entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| And to your point, Commissioner Phil, a lot of our roads don't have any right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| I mean, we paved roads back years ago that, you know, there was a handshake agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| there isn't any right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| So we're very limited in what right-of-way we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| We've been fortunate to use a lot of this right-of-way that we've got through dedications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| for road projects, but upcoming, I think we're probably going to have to have a traffic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| analysis that identifies off-site improvements for us to have that nexus, I think is kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| of what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| And the cases that don't have that traffic impact analysis that justifies off-site improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| there's more or less, we're not going to be able to require that dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| And the county, when we do have to go in and make those improvements, we'll then have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| purchase that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| How does it affect PR and us as a body being able to say, you know, because PR is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| important for us to almost say whatever we want with a subdivision, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| And I know we've had some come forward where there's been a greenway that has ended and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| then it gets extended through a PR zone and we've made that a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| Would that be an...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Is that part of the nexus formula we don't know yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Like, is a greenway count as a type of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| I think you need to be really careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| I don't think that was necessarily the intent behind this particular legislation, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| is something that needs to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| I think, you know, in terms of whether or not it could be required or it's requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| to be added, I mean, that's something that you need to weigh out when you're having those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| conversations with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Just to touch on an issue with front setbacks on county roads that don't have right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| the zoning ordinance does, for the county at least, it does require the front setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| to start 20 feet from the centerline of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| So if the right-of-way is only 10 feet wide, technically your setback doesn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| Like, you start measuring the setback 20 feet from the centerline of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| So it's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| You wouldn't get all, like, your front property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| You wouldn't measure necessarily from the front property line if it's right against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| the road surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| So, Tasha, do we have a choice since this is coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| That's an easy one, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| So the debate is real but unnecessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Well, the debate is around, you know, how to appropriately respond and modify the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| that methodologies or the way that things have been handled, but is there any discretion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| The state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| I'll put a little star next to that, which is, well, no, we don't right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| I think if we find a problem, it might be wise for us to work through the director to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| send potential changes to our legislative delegation for them to consider going in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| fixing if we're finding problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| So, little asterisk there, because, again, you know, they'll start being able to file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| bills around November the 6th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| So, anything that we see that there's going to be a problem, I hear what you all are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| My guess is, I'd love to know who sponsored this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| It probably is one of those great things that came out of Nashville of a bunch of unintended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| consequences that are hurting us when it was intended to fix something in a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| community in a very small section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| So I think if we can go back and say, you know, we need to fix this because it's causing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| some other problems, we'll be successful in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| Hey, Amy, can I add one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| And one thing, to your point, Commissioner Smith, that we saw, the bill originally included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| that there was a reservation or essentially an easement adjacent to the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| that, you know, that the person couldn't build in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| It was almost like a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| That way, you know, when the county did come in and have to acquire right-of-way, it wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| necessarily cost us as much if there were structures that would be damaged due to proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| That also got removed from the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| So that is something that's concerned me specifically, was, you know, if we don't have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| reservation there like what was originally proposed and somebody builds closer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| road, as we have that taking, you know, that damages to that remainder, puts more financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| burden on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| So there may be some good changes that would be appropriate and or reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2731)|

| 0:46:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2764)|
| 0:46:15| Commissioner Higgins, would you like to join us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2775)|

| 0:48:04| So that'll be heard in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| So moving on to item number 13, case number 8E22RZ and 8C22SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2885)|

| 0:48:41| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| In this zoning map, you can see the property is surrounded by large agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| properties and RA zone properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| The area is entirely residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| In the sector plan map, it's entirely low density residential and some additional context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2937)|
| 0:49:07| In this 2008 aerial, you can see that the property is fairly undeveloped with one dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| unit and then in this more recent aerial, you can see there's been quite a bit of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2953)|
| 0:49:23| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| There's a warehouse and several trucks and parking areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| They did receive a codes violation notice for running an HVAC business here and since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2971)|
| 0:49:40| then have requested a rezoning to general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2980)|
| 0:49:46| We are recommending a denial of CA zoning and the general commercial land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| because it's incompatible with the surrounding land use and the rural residential character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| of the area and it does not meet any of the sector plan amendment requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| Is there an alternative that would allow them to still run their business without being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| in violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Mr. Elliott, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| No, unfortunately commercial businesses are not allowed in the RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| There's not some kind of special use we could refer to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3022)|
| 0:50:32| I'll just add that thinking about just the zone itself, other uses that would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| if it was rezoned to CA would be a demolition landfill, an auto repair shop, a cannery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| These are some of the reasons why we think CA is inappropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| Is it rural commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Isn't that a zone we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Is that allowed in, does that have to be the sector plan still wouldn't match up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| Thank you, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I'll switch over to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| For agenda item 20, Isaac Pinnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| You all have received a lot of comments on this one, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3081)|
| 0:51:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| This property is 5.75 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| It's north of Maryville Pike and west of Yonge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| It's on the east of Woodson Drive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| The applicant is requesting to go from low density residential and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| to general commercial and hillside protection on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| They are also requesting a rezoning from low density residential, which is the RA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| to CB, business and manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| This is a zoning map of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| You can see that the majority of the property is zoned RA on this side of Maryville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3143)|
| 0:52:32| and adjacent to that are RN2 zoned areas within the City of Knoxville zoning areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3152)|
| 0:52:40| It's primarily single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Although it is adjacent to the commercial and industrial zoned corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| along the railroad and along Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| However, the property is currently forested and has some steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| as well as some closed depressions that are visible on the topo map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| which may indicate the presence of sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| This map shows that a little bit more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| You can see the little hatched lines on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| that show that there could potentially be sinkholes in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3189)|
| 0:53:16| This map shows the zoning overlaid on an aerial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| and the blue dots on the map represent the existing vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| So, although this area has been zoned for a mix of commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| and industrial uses for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| there continue to be many vacant commercial and industrial zoned properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| with frontage already on Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| If we're looking toward the frontage of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| this is a street view looking east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| It shows the character of the areas primarily remained residential in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| You can also see the proximity to the residential home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| on the western side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| This is a bird's eye view of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| and again, they're asking to go to the CB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| So, we have to look at the entire range of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| and intent of the CB zone when we're making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| And this zone district is supposed to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| for a mix of business and manufacturing uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| It's also expected that it would attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| large volumes of automobile and truck traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| and have adverse effects on surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| It's not really associated or compatible with residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| So, for these reasons, staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| to deny the sector plan amendment to GCE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| because it's inconsistent with the character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| We're also recommending to deny CB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| because it's not compatible with the surrounding residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| I just want to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| if I'm tracking this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| this property is also right beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| Historic Flinicken, the antebellum farmhouse that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| I actually think you might be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Let me see if I can pull up the map real quick for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3315)|
| 0:55:24| Yeah, that's correct. It's just to the south there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| I think it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| if I'm understanding the zone correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| it abuts that Historic Flinicken property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| Let me toggle to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| It looks like there might be a parcel between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| the one where you all are considering this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| and the Flinicken House property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| But it is in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| I would have to consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| as another rationale for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| staff's recommendation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3366)|
| 0:56:18| There's the Flinicken House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| and the property in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| It's the adjacent area to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| Any other questions or comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| for Liz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Thank you, Liz. We'll switch it over to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| He has a couple cases to cover today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:56| Mike will be reviewing agenda item number 21 and 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Let's wait for the monitor. There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| I just want to go over this one real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| just because of the challenges that this property has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| with access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| I'd also just want to give some context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| of what they're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Staff is recommending approval of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| So this is an 18-lot attached house subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| The property was recently rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| to plan residential up to 5 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| with 18 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| That's 4.99 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| One of the conditions is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| that once the property is platted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| they need to verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| that they actually have the acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| that they say they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| to allow all 18 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| since it's so close to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| 5 dwelling unit per acre maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| They are asking for a private road system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| 24-foot pavement width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| So the next bullet point here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| so this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| it's on Ball Camp Pike right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| If you look at it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| it's just a straight road in front of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| with improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Ball Camp Pike and Byington Solway intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| is going to be realigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| to be adjacent to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| which really complicates access for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| And the road itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| is going to be elevated quite a few feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| I kind of estimated about a 27-foot elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| for the road itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| so they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| have a pretty steep road coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| onto their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| or leaving their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| or entering their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| and going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| They are asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| an intersection separation variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| There's really no way around it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| and I'll kind of explain that a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| So here's the Chaud Road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| You can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| the approximate location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| of the property is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Ball Camp Pike currently runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| straight in front of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| and the Byington Solway intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| is over to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Byington Solway is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| run right in front of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| and Ball Camp Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| is going to curve to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| You can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| there's an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| at grade railroad crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| that's going to be eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| so this section of road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| is going to be gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| and there'll be a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| railroad crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| with a bridge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| This is a little bit closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| view of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| just to give you an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| of what's surrounding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| There's just a couple of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| that are a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| not right on their property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| because they do have a driveway here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| They will be accessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| the new Byington Solway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| approximately here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| go to their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| hardly any road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| It's classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| so they would have to have a 300 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| separation between intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| and their new road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| which they don't have frontage to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Staff is supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| the connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3631)|

| 1:00:35| to Byington Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| They have a full access in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| which means people can turn left in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| they can turn right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| but the design is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| exit right only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| The road is too close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| to this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| and there's turn lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| here so it's kind of hard to see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| but there's a left turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| that's right in front of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| and connecting to Ball Camp Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| really is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| a great option either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| So that's where we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| if anybody has any questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| The applicant's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| opposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| this design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| It is kind of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| This might be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| make you aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| what challenges this property has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| just in case it does get discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| that their access is pretty limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| Any questions or comments from Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| This will be for County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| I know you say it's right turn only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| out of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| Is the road there going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| a U-turn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| We've all lived in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| People will do a U-turn on Interstate 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| There's nothing going to keep them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| turning left out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| unless there's a big concrete barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Yeah, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| and I think Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| that plan may be kind of hard to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| but there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| or we will require them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| to build a concrete island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| that deflects traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| that movement is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Isn't that whole road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| going to be a divided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| kind of a divided highway anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Not at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Not there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Not, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| In that location it's just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| just a double yellow there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| You have to get over onto the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| main road to get the median section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| Move on to item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| So this property is at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| on Choteau Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| near South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| Commissioner Huber should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| well familiar with this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| adjacent to his properties at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| This is another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| 18 lot subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| This is detached residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| It was recently rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| to plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| I think at 5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Their build out is at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| this one is asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| a variance to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| the intersection separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Much like the other one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| there really is a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| on their frontage where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| they won't be asking for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| They are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| their entrance to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| more on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| closer to Palm Beach Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| If they centered it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| I mean they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| it would reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| the intersection but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| there's a fairly good sized pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| right here at the beginning of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| front of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| that they're going to have to modify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| just to even get the road where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| And if they moved it to the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| or the north side of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| there's another subdivision road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| that they would have to get a variance from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| so it's really not a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| that they could put the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| and not ask for variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| They are asking for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| 25 foot peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| The reason why they're asking for 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| here is the adjacent subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Choteau Meadows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| also had a 25 foot peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| setback approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| so they're asking to match that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| The subdivision to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| has a 35 foot peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| so they're going to keep that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| The property to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| is also on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| for a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| That one was actually approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| originally back in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| and they've changed that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| and so it's coming back through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| for an approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| but it will also have a 35 foot peripheral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| So the pond is considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| that's on the front side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| is considered a wetland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| and they'll have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| a permitting process to modify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| to be able to put their road in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| This is some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| So this is Choteau on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| There is the neighborhood commercial center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Then there's the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| and they will be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| to put a sidewalk along their frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| and eventually hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| that sidewalk will then connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| further to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3925)|

| 1:05:29| There's already a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| on the opposite side of Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| that connects from this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| up to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| which is about to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| as a Choteau beer market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Then they'll finish off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| that sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| around that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| There will be a sidewalk here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| that connects up to the intersection anyways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| if there's not one there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| here's some more context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| of looking at opposite direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| This is the Choteau markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| the adjacent subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| with the 25 foot peripheral here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Those are detached houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| that are just kind of close together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| and then this is the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| to the east that has the 35 foot peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| and you can see the pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Can you go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| the first illustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| that we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| that showed...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Because I'm responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| to a community comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| about lots one through four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Can you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| I'm guessing that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| these lots here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| On one through four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| a request to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| that the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| was kept at 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Well, the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| as I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| is really not going to be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| I mean, they're going to have to have a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| and if you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| where the pond location is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| their new road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| I think is going to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| close to where the existing driveway is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| only it's going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| be part of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| or play the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| if they increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| the separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| they're going to be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| straight through the middle of that pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| with their road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| which really isn't going to be as feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| and if they go further to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| or northwest here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| then they're getting closer to this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| which is across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| I really don't see too much conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| happening with having a road here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| that's going to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| north on Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| there's not going to be a whole lot of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| going in the opposite direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| so somebody turning right out of this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| and right out of this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| you're not really going to have to make conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| So, having an intersection separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| like they're requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| doesn't appear to be a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| That's speaking to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| 300 to 186.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| What about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| buffer for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| the one through four lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| It's a five foot peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| as required in the PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| there is no other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| required buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| they can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| if they wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| the developer can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| if they wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| have a fence or landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| they could install that if they wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| it's not a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| that staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| there are two similar uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| back to back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| just like most subdivisions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| This may tie into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| agenda item 38| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| but you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| there's another subdivision happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| behind this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| is there any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| connection between those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| We did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| broach the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| with the two applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| they did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| seem interested in doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| there is some elevation change between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| which would make it difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| so a road connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| is probably not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| not feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| but they're proposing these two developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| and this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| the one that we're discussing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| they've actually requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| in their application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| they might actually do a private road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| if they do a private road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| it would be the exact same design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| but they weren't getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| With that connection like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| I would be a little bit concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| with creating almost a cut through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| between Choteau Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| and North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| as Mike had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| I developed a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| parcels out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| and even through the markets at Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| occasionally we get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| cutting through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| to try to avoid the roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| I would be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| with something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| I'm glad you brought that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| I think one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| that was shared with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| at the advanced NOx| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| when the first results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| were starting to be shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| at the session that you offered for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| if I'm remembering correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| there was a high interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| in walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| and what you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| Commissioner Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| is walkability, connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| making those things possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| and it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| I think we kind of find ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| into catch 22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| that at the development stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| there's a reluctance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| to build that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| for the potential future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| but then once people are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| and they're starting to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| live in that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| they start to want those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| I appreciate you bringing it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| and there's a lot of studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| that talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| the detrimental effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| of all these disconnected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| subdivisions that we're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| all over the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| and so I got kind of excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| at the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| of two developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| that are in the same phase right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| but if one of them is going to be private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| then a private road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| then that's different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| it's not always the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| use of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| to have a private road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| for a small number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| when higher numbers of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| could use these public roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| and just one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| quick comment out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| and I totally agree with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| I believe in the connection of roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| because really when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| doing markets at Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| we were trying to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| a walkable situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| and connecting the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| so I'm excited to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| that some of the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| will be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| for access for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| I guess my point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| when this one in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| only this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| it would be effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| two cul-de-sac roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| that we'd be connecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| there are no blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| and here and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| we would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| normal walkability situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| and I'd hate for somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| we could have a connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| it doesn't have to be a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| it could be a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| or a walkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| a natural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| because most residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| don't want traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| coming through their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| that's an experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| that I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| the last six years down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| they just oppose it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| vehemently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| could we not propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| just a pedestrian connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| we discussed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| with them as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| they were not interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| in making a connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| you could make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| requirement again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| there is a bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| elevation change between two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| so making an ADA accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| connection might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| so you'd be dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| with these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| properties between each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| trying to think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| what the ultimate benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| would be in the grand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| scheme of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| people, where they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| obviously two neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| back to back would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| getting to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| more proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| I guess most people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| would probably be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| to the center here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| along north shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| which already extends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| in front of the Cheto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| market's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| so I guess if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| was in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| along Cheto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| they could cut through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| and get to the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| a little faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| a little shortcut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| but there's really not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| a whole lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| but we already approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| to the north right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| this one was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| approved prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| and their road design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| is essentially the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| as before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| they just went from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| dwellings to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| detached dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| and there was enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| modification in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| how they designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| that we felt a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220809-agenda-review?start=4475)|
