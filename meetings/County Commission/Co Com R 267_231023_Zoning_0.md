| 0:00:58| Thank you. We do have a quorum and Commissioner Lee did ask me to announce she was here for our regular meeting and went home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=58)|
| 0:01:05| She is not feeling well at all, so that is why her absence is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| Law Director Moyers, I'll turn this over to you now, please, if you'll swear in any applicants or people that will be testifying tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=78)|

| 0:01:43| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| Madam Clerk, if you'll go ahead and read the first item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=114)|
| 0:02:03| Item number 539-A-23-SP is a request of Patrick Hunt for a South City Sector Plan Amendment from Agricultural and HP Hillside Protection to LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=123)|
| 0:02:16| Low Density Residential and HP Hillside Protection, properties located at 4424 Island Home Pike, parcel ID 110-PD-004 in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=136)|
| 0:02:30| Thank you. Is the applicant present? Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=150)|
| 0:02:38| If you'd introduce yourself, please, your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=158)|
| 0:02:47| Thank you. Hi, my name is Patrick Hunt, 603 Kennesaw Avenue, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| Thank you. Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| Seeing none, Planning Commission, if you'd please read your recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=178)|
| 0:03:06| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the Sector Plan Amendment to LDR, Low Density Residential Land Use Classification because of the access to sewer and significant changes in condition by a vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=186)|
| 0:03:17| The HP Hillside Protection will be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| All right. Do you wish to say anything about your project, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| I would be happy to entertain any questions if there are any after folks reviewed the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| All right. Fellow Commissioners, do we have any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| Seeing no lights. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| Thank you. Director Brooks, your staff recommended that they deny the Sector Plan Amendment to LDR because the land use classification does not meet the land use location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=226)|
| 0:04:02| Did you want to expound on that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| Sure. Yes, that is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| Well, there was a couple different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| For one, that the subject property, the land use classification of agricultural did not align with its location in the urban growth area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=253)|
| 0:04:27| So that was one of the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| And that growth policy plan defers back to the sector plan to ensure that it's consistent, so all rezoning amendments should be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| The ag land use classification, even though it's inconsistent with the growth policy plan, staff felt like it wasn't necessarily tied to an error in that plan because there had been community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=280)|
| 0:04:55| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| Seeing no other lights. Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| Thank you, Madam Chair. There is some LDR down the street there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| This area is going to be growing. And let me get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| One second here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| I talked to Patrick, or Mr. Hunt, I'm sorry, talked to Mr. Hunt on the phone last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| He thought he might have had to come and speak last week, but he did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| I'd like to make a motion to accept Planning Commission's action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| All right, we have a motion on the floor to accept Planning Commission's recommendation with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| Questions? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| Seeing none. All those in favor? Aye. Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Your motion carries, sir. Thank you. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| The next item, number 54, 9-A-23-RZ, is also a request of Patrick Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| It's for rezoning from AAC Cultural to PR Plan Residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| All right. If you would introduce yourself again as the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| Hi, I'm Patrick Hunt, 603 Kennesaw Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| All right. And is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Seeing none. Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR Plan Residential zone up to five dwelling units per acre by vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| All right. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| I keep forgetting to push that button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| Mr. Hunt, you and I spoke. You were planning on doing tiny homes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| something similar to a tiny home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Something similar. A tiny home is typically defined as about 600 to 650 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| and my plan calls for a handful of very small footprint homes that are about 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| How many square feet, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| About 1,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| 1,100. And to me, that's part of that missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Their price point won't be way out there to where –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| South Knoxville used to be a starter community where you can come in and buy a starter home as a young couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| so I think this will meet some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| Do you know your price range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| You don't have to tell me. It's not my business to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| It's a great question. When we first bought the property in 2019, we priced out the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| Pricing has changed dramatically since that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| and we haven't repriced it until we go through the rezoning process and are prepared to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| I'll make a motion to approve per Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| We have a motion on the floor and a second by Beeler, approving Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| Are there any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| Good luck on your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Item number 55, 9-D-23-RZ, is a request of Rick Harvin for rezoning from A, Agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=513)|
| 0:08:42| to PR Plan Residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| The property is located at 7620 Rio Grande Drive, parcel ID 066-12006 in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=525)|
| 0:08:55| Thank you. You are the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Would you introduce yourself, please, and your residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| Yes, ma'am. I am Rick Harvin, and I live at 7615 Rio Grande Drive, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| All right. Is there any opposition to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| Seeing none, Director Brooks, would you read the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the RA Lodgency Residential Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development by a vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| All right. Would you like to speak to this project, Mr. Harvin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| Well, it's been in my family for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| It's been agricultural, but it's landlocked with residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| It's only appropriate to take it to residential for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| It's a small lot, and I can only get a house or two on it, so I don't have any immediate plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| All right. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Thank you, Madam Chair. Do you have a density that you're considering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| You said one to two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| I'm only allowed one house on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| Now, if it was subdivided, I'd be allowed one on each lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| But it's only about, what, an acre and 1.6 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Yeah, so it's small. I don't have any multi-house plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| Seeing no other lies, this does lie in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=630)|

| 0:23:18| There's certainly some topography there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| There's not a lot of hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| There's only a little over two acres that's technically in the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| Most of that is less than 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| If we were in the city and we had a disturbance allowance based upon the hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| I think most of that would be allowed to be disturbed even with the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1417)|

| 0:24:02| much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1442)|

| 0:24:09| Usually when you have a piece of undeveloped property that then gets developed to modern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| standards, it can actually have the effect of improving the drainage in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| We've also understood that, and this came up during the meeting on October 11, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| even though the maximum density we can get at 4.5 units an acre would be 58 units, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| wouldn't automatically trigger a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| But because there's ongoing issues there that have been discussed, there's ongoing improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| there that are planned, that the county would want to have some type of traffic study or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1476)|

| 0:24:55| That's not an issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Again, we'll be engaged with the neighborhood, not just now, but when we move forward back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1497)|

| 0:26:09| address the concerns of the impacted neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1569)|

| 0:26:38| bill to pay for the left-turn lane at Fretz Road on Campbell Station Road, which was required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| due to the density of development that has been previously permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| If you would introduce yourself, please, and residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Theresa Barker, President of the Brandywine HOA, Knox County, and pretty much what everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| has said here, our neighborhood is concerned with three basic things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| We're concerned with the road safety, Fretz and Campbell Station, and Hatmaker, and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| the drainage that has been extensively described, and with privacy with the homes that abut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| There are homes in our neighborhood that right now would abut that development, and we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| like to have a buffer and some privacy trees or something put in place so that the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| development isn't looking into our homes and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| With regard to road safety, we have three developments plus our own, and one already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| well, we've got about five developments, and three are already being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| When they're all completely finished, this little country road will have over 800, 400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| homes just using this one little country road, with the average home having roughly two cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| per home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| That's around 800 or so cars running up and down Fretz and Hatmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| It is a very dangerous situation, even currently with the cars that are running up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| We have a sharp turn on Hatmaker and Fretz, and the intersection of Campbell Station and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| Hatmaker really needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| Whether it's a sign or a calming circle, something needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| With regard to drainage, we have flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| We have, on a steady rain, water runs across Fretz and the dip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| We have homes that have standing water in their backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| One home, which is not directly related, that butts up to Ridgeland, her backyard is always wet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1719)|
| 0:28:48| I'm hoping that with the possibility of working together with the new development, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| can come together and solve a lot of these drainage issues, but those are our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| with regard to moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| I'm happy to work with everybody to see that we can all come to a reasonable conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| and would also welcome the commissioners, engineering, to come and visit these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1748)|
| 0:29:17| to see what is actually going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| I thank you for your time, and for the time you've already given us previous to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1760)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Is there anyone else that wants to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| Mr. Smith, were you wanting to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Go ahead and please introduce yourself and residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| My name is Scott Smith, 405 Montbrook Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| I'm the developer here, and I just want to go over a couple of things that were touched on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| I walked out, first of all, regarding drainage, I went out and met with the folks in Brandywine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| and we looked at their issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| I don't believe any of their issues will be affected in any way by the development of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1805)|
| 0:30:14| There's two things going on with their drainage issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Number one, Ridgeland, which is, they have half-acre lots because they're on septic tanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| and they are in the town of Fairgate to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| They have one pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| They have no infrastructure for drainage but two catch basins, no pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| And the one pipe is an 18-inch metal pipe that discharges across a small strip of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| and there was a receiver pipe that had brush all over it, and that's where they got really badly flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| And this doesn't cross the property that I'm looking at, and it doesn't drain to the property I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1846)|
| 0:30:54| It just came across, and I saw videos, and it is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| And, I mean, if we can help with that, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| But there are solutions to their problem that don't involve me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| and I told them I'd be glad to help them with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| The second problem they have is the houses in this little area that are collecting water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| We were there Saturday, and they're wet now, and it hasn't really rained in so long from irrigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| But the houses, I think, were set too low, and the houses are the low point in the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| So there's nowhere for the water to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| And we met one lady who said, I keep putting dirt here, but it's just the water's moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| But a French drain, I feel like, would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| On some of these small lots, we do French drains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| It allows underground water to get low and get out, and I've got a contact that can help them with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| I'm going to share that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| But drainage issues on the property we're looking at, I listen to everybody talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| It seems like this is the worst property in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| It's really a fine piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| There's nothing wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| It does have a couple of challenges, but there's nothing that we're going to do that's going to affect them in a negative way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| I'm happy to put evergreens, trees along the boundary that we share with Brandywine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| because that was a concern that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| The second thing is, at 4.5 units an acre, if you just look at zoning, the appropriate use of this property, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1945)|
| 0:32:34| And this is less than a mile from an interstate interchange, Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| I think I measured it at like 3,800, 4,800 feet, the Campbell Station exit, to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1960)|
| 0:32:50| There is not a more perfect property for the upper end, density-wise, of low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| There are two apartment complexes almost on the other side of Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| Today, we are in a severe lack of housing, and cost-wise, people are having a hard time affording these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1982)|
| 0:33:12| Density helps us make things cheaper to the people that are buying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| We can spend all the money in the world, but we've got to pass it on, and it just hurts the end buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| I would ask that you give us a little flexibility at the 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| We'll be happy to work with the neighbors and continue to help them with their drainage problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| but honestly, I don't think there's a lot that our property does to affect those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Just briefly, when we look at the zoning, and I think Vice Mayor Pavlin mentioned transitional density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| if you just look at the zoning map that's attached to the report, you've got ridgeland to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| Now, it's developed on half-acre lots because they're on septic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| but the RA zoning would allow 10,000 square foot lots if it had water and sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| and so that's roughly 4.3 units and acres, what that density would be for the RA zoning above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| Brandywine, Ms. Barker, where she lives, the subdivision we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| it was zoned at 5 units an acre and I think built out at roughly 4.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| and so we're right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| When you look at the other zonings, there's 4 units an acre interspersed in that area as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| so we believe that the 4.5, as Mr. Smith said, is right in line with the upper end of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| Again, this is the first step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| There's a planned development stage that will come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| We'll be working with Mr. Snowden and his folks to address the issues that this development will cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| and so we do appreciate your consideration in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Commissioner Jay, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Mr. Snowden, can you give us an update on the infrastructure work that was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| that we've talked about before and where that lies in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| Sure, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| I think we ended up with about 7 or 8 parcels that we had to acquire some minor right-of-way from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| to expand the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| The town of Farragut was gracious enough to grant us a design variance to their normal standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| so we did kind of shrink it in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| That saved us some cost and allowed for that narrowing of that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| I think we have three of those under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| The other three or four we're still negotiating with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| As Mr. Mullins mentioned, our anticipated start date would be early spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| We foresee the next two to three months we'll be able to resolve these right-of-way concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| because they don't appear to be any significant acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Then we could start construction hopefully sometime in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| probably a 120-day, four-month project, pretty straightforward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| depending on utility relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| It would be our hope to have this project complete by late summer of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| Ms. Povlin, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2178)|
| 0:36:27| Can you help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| You mentioned that this is, and your email mentioned that this property is in the Farragut urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| But it's not in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Help me understand how you have jurisdiction over something that's not in your jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| Well, we don't have jurisdiction, but that's the struggle that we're addressing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| with going through this growth policy plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| This area on our land use plan is low-density residential cluster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| but our cluster only allows up to 2.178 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| which is why Campbell Crossing is 2.16 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| And that's why, I understand what you're saying, but I'm also, we do transitional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| we have a transitional philosophy in our zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| or I'm sorry, in our land use plan for this particular issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| where you have something that's four and a half units per acre below it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| and then you have one and a half units, which was developed in the county at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| We think a transitional density allows you to look at what's going on around it and absorb it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| and it was proposed by Madam Chair Hill at the last, during your May discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| and I thought that was brilliant that she had stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| because it really does help in the appearance of what's going on with Ridgeland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| That's an existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| You put four and a half units per acre, it gets crowded up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| and it looks completely different than what Ridgeland is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| By providing some transition, making those lot size a little bit larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| you're going to allow for a better look and feel for the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| The other concern is that there is more to come on this particular corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2292)|
| 0:38:20| There's a lot of agricultural on the other side as well in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| That whole corridor is getting loaded down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| If you go look at it, it's loaded down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| What's going in there is very dense for single family detached, and that is our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| We are the ones that absorb a lot of this traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| We're going to be dealing with the conditions that are on Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| We're the ones that have to deal with trying to connect because the rest of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| finding a way to connect all this in is going to fall to Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| because that's in our jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| If you look beyond to the, I guess it's to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| Do you have other areas outside of the township of Farragut that are in the urban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| I mean, all over the place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Actually, I think we have less than a square mile of urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| The other area of growth boundary is Concord Road by old Concord area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| Concord Road itself is in the town of Farragut's boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| and then right outside is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Okay, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| So it's just harder for me to, I understand the transitional thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| and we're all in the county together, whether you're city, Farragut, or county, county, county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| And when one thing is built here, it affects, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| everybody's affected by everything in growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| and there's hardly going to be a parcel of land that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| inside of a sort of a corridor area that's not going to be developed at some point as we grow as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| I don't disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| I guess I'm struggling because I remember this back in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| and it's sort of like everybody wants to tell the landowner what to do with this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| but when the landowner wants to try to help some of the other previously existing issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2415)|
| 0:40:23| nobody wants to give them the tools to be able to have the resources to help other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| and so it's like, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| They have the tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| I don't agree with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| No, no, but I mean the density, I mean, in building, the density allows for a larger, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| economic footprint to be able to invest more in drainage and infrastructure and this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| Well, I would use Campbell Crossing as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Campbell Crossing is our R1OSR overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| It was allowed to have up to 2.178 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| They got to 2.16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| They have 35 percent open space, and they were able to put in their stormwater drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| and those houses are selling about the same as the houses in Brandywine, so much lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| I guess I'm struggling because it's like there's so many conditions on this little corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| yet Knox County is investing, you know, a significant amount of resources into helping with the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| And Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| It seems to be hamstrung, this one little sliver, and everything around it is developed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| I'm just trying to figure out why we don't need more housing everywhere, especially like so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| We're trying to remain true to our character, and I know that was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| As you guys are going through your growth policy plan and through the new plan you're going to place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| character is important to you, and the character of that corridor is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| I understand that you think that this is about residential, but when you drive down that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| that corridor is rural in feel, and most of the residents in that area would like to preserve that rural feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2513)|
| 0:42:01| I will add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Can I finish my thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Can I finish my thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| We have invested an incredible amount of money over the last 43 years in our entire town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| to absorb traffic and growth that is not created by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| We are hit pretty hard by Choteau traffic that comes up through McPhee and Virtue Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| We recognize that we are part of this whole infrastructure network of roads that we need to get traffic through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| We do this willingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| We've done it willingly for 43 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| We are trying to advocate to preserve some of the character of Ridgeland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| and not go from one and a half units an acre, regardless of how it got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| It is one and a half units an acre to four and a half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| We talk all the time, so I'm happy to have the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| I don't think you can have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| I don't think Farragut can say we welcome everybody to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| We love your tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| We love your shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| We love your commerce, but it's not our fault that we have all your traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| You get it regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| We all get it regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| It's not like you guys are sitting there going, oh, don't come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| We want to keep everything super rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Everybody has welcomed growth and opportunity, and I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| I guess my hard part is you've got a lot of different neighbors in really, really close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| that are just fine living in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| That was somebody else's farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| That was somebody else's rural field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| That was somebody else's character and preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Everybody else that lives there now is just fine, but the next one, well, not so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| and the next one, not so much, and the next one, not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| That's my problem is sort of why we talk about wanting things denser in closer corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2632)|
| 0:44:01| to things to keep the rural areas more rural and preserved, yet it seems like this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| like every time we get to a spot where it's in a tighter corridor with more development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| and in exactly what we asked for, then we slow down and go, well, maybe a little too dense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| and then we've exacerbated our problem again and again because the next farm is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| more sprawl and more sprawl and more sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| This reaches every corridor or every characteristic of corridor density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| yet we're not taking opportunities for it, and that's where I really have a problem going down in density here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2674)|
| 0:44:42| because it's literally surrounded by the exact same density in most of the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Can I just, one last point, and then I'm going to leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Yeah, no, no, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Campbell Station Road is limited in our ability to expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| You know how challenging that road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| It's going to be a matter of putting in turn lanes here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| We're never going to be able to widen that to three lanes with a permanent turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| So those are our limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| They just are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| I think I'm just going to leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| I've lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| People have a right to develop their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| I very much believe and agree with property rights for people, constitutionally protected private property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| I talk about it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| You don't want to see a property developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| Go buy it, please, because in Farragut, we're kind of getting close to built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| and we're seeing a lot of it happen very quickly, and it's very overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| But people have rights, and it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| It also makes sense to look at the existing built environment and protect that and the character of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| That's part of what makes Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Knox County is that we're looking at the character of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| So Fretz Road, to me, has got more of a rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| Campbell Station Road can only be expanded so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| The opportunity to possibly connect Hatmaker into Everett Road has been taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| That would have helped tremendously with connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| I know it was challenging because of topography, but we've put roads in challenging topography before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| So I'm going to leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| But thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Director Brooks, in the documents that you provided to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| could you go to the page following the staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| It's page 21-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| It starts out as comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| Is the title public comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| No, it just starts out comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| It's after your staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Did you find it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Okay, could you read the second paragraph for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| Since a new application for the same proposal cannot be accepted by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| for a period of one year from the date of denial for the Planning Commission bylaws section 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| this application is for a slightly lower density than was previously requested at 4.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| Okay, but aren't they asking for 4.5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| and how can you accept an application less than one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| I think there's a typo in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| I believe it was five previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| So did you amend your Planning Commission bylaws section 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| or did you just make an executive decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| No, I believe my understanding is that the request previously was for five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| but that the Planning Commission had approved at 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Okay, but your rules say you can't do it for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| but somebody made an executive decision then to go ahead and allow this to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| because it was a lower density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| No, the applicant can't make the same request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| It has nothing to do with what the Planning Commission actually recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Okay, all right, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| And then Director Snowden, do you see drainage issues on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2908)|
| 0:48:38| You know, just looking at the topography of it, and much to Mr. Smith's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| this property sits above the folks in Brandywine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| so pretty much all the water, the lion's share of it, drains away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| I guess that would be towards Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| It looks like a total of about 20 acres comes to the cross drain under Fretz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| I think this property is about 12 acres, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| and then there's about eight of Richland, or whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| I'm sorry, it may not be the upstream subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| I do not foresee any drainage problems associated with the folks in Brandywine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| as part of this just because of the way the land naturally lays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| He's going to have to sheet his water away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| Mr. Mullins, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| Just briefly, if I could, I really appreciate the dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| between Commissioner Jay and Vice Mayor Pavlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| As I understand, being in the urban growth boundary for Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| the only legal significance it had was prior to 2017 when the state law changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| the town of Farragut could have annexed this property into their territory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| and then they would have had jurisdictional control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| For whatever reason, they did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| The 2017 change, you can't annex property anymore involuntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| It's got to be by permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| I don't know if that got discussed in that part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| but I just wanted to point out Farragut had an opportunity at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| to have jurisdictional control over this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| and did not exercise that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| As far as the character, Brandywine's lot sizes are between 45 and 47 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| We're looking at between 50 and 56 feet is what we're trying to target for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| So the lot sizes are going to be similar in scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| maybe a little bit larger than what's there at Brandywine at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| I don't remember looking back at the town of Farragut objected to the Brandywine zoning at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| I'm not sure. It seems like the same concerns would be placed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Thank you. Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| First of all, I want to say thank you to Mr. Mullins and Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| for taking the time to go out and meet with the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| and also the residents for being very diligent with their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| and communicating those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| I always have said in the past that we always seem to find more middle ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| when we do that prior to these kind of very formal settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| There were some really great discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| and there are a lot of, I believe, serious considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| from existing development in this area that we absolutely should consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| and protect those residents who are currently living on frets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| My comments and questions, there has been significant residential development on frets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| with single access in and out, and that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| I know there have been attempts in the past to cost share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| some of the road improvements to frets as a result of that intense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| Director Snowden, are those discussions still active, or where are we on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| They're not at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| We did discuss those early on, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| and we weren't able to agree on any kind of principal agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| with the various developers that were adding some of this traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| Were we not able to agree from a county side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| or were we not able to negotiate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| We always want to be fair and equitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| so what we had proposed to the group of developers that were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| Mr. Smith being one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| was a pro-rata share based on the traffic generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| Obviously, there's certain background traffic there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| that the county has a partnership in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| and then obviously they had a couple of subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| both Mr. Smith and Mr. Davis, and we proposed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3177)|
| 0:53:05| I think their last proposal was that they would match $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| but unfortunately with the turn lane being the cost that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| based on our estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| we really couldn't find common ground as far as what we felt like was fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| from the county's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| That bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| I mean, I just have to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| That really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| I don't know why we couldn't come to some sort of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| with those who are contributing to the need for road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| and I feel like it's falling back on the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| who currently live on Fretz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| and so I would ask if there could be continued discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Maybe we start those discussions again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| but I would like to see some sort of cost sharing agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| for these road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Additional question, do you see sight distance considerations here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| I know there's a curb right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| I looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| At the meeting that we had, there was some concern about vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| and I think as part of our proposed project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| we are going to be adding sidewalk and wider lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| so a lot of that vegetation will be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| so I think we can achieve the necessary sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| with some minor modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| Would this project warrant a turn lane, just this project alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Based on, as these folks have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| there's been a lot of development on Fretz Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| so at this point, pretty much any additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| that's generated on Fretz Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| is going to trip or warrant for a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| There are two closed depressions on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| If those do turn out to be sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| is the applicant prepared to do whatever's necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| I know that there's something like a 50-foot buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| or a 50-foot no-build buffer around the contour lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| That would be something that we would include, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| in working with engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Yes, there is a 50-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| You can build in that buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| but it takes an additional geotechnical analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| to engineer the footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| And then would it be appropriate for commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| to include some of these mitigation efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| as conditions in the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| Because these are things that I would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| you know, up to five conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| like the applicant agrees to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| and adhere to the findings of a traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| The applicant agrees to submit a stormwater management plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| to engineering for approval at the time of the grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| The applicant will agree to a 50-foot no-build buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| around the largest contour line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| if Geotech Services determines sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| a Type A landscape screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| and then the left southbound turn lane project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| being completed before the issuance of any building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| I mean, those are things and protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| that I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| And those are really just my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Again, I really do applaud everyone's efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| on trying to do everything possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| to protect those who are on Fretz Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| But I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| I would really like some protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| And that's nothing on the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| That's just the state of where we are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| We seem to just get the short end of the stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| on so many of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| and these are just protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| that I would like to see as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| And we can start including in our motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| So that concludes my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| Are there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| Well, big surprise, this is District 6 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| There's been a great deal of energy and effort put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| since it came before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| under another owner a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| And Ms. Poplin, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| I did make those statements at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| because I had had no contact from anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| except unhappy neighbors about that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| Since then, that has definitely changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| We have a new developer that's presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| that has been more than willing to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| with the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| Also made some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| reached out with some indications of promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| that I'm about to include in a motion that I'm going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| I am satisfied after spending a great deal of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| talking with Mr. Stoden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| that the water issues are not related to the property in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3516)|
| 0:58:48| that it is a problem that came from the existing subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| that for whatever reason, and I don't know who that falls on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| that is an old subdivision built years and years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| that things were just not completed correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| And it is something that's going to have to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| Quite frankly, I'm not sure whose responsibility that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| if it isn't the subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| or it's way too late to go back on the original developer with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| or that's something that the county needs to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| I don't believe the town of Farragut is going to be coming and helping with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| I don't know what the issue is. I would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| I don't feel comfortable committing to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| if it's something on the town of Farragut's right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| or we have an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| But I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| When we pulled up the stormwater map, that's all I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| and I don't even know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| I don't know if there's stormwater pipes running through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| and whose responsibility is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Is it the HOA's? Is it the town of Farragut's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Our part comes to where I know that as water moves through one property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| is the way I understand it, it becomes the next property down issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| once you get it off your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| But I have no idea what is going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| Certainly, we'll have our engineer out there to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| and work with Darrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| He has a great working relationship with Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Get them both out there to figure out what the issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| and where the responsibilities lie is certainly about all I can commit to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| But to be clear, that subdivision is in the township of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| It is, but it was developed in 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| It was zoned and it was still in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| We weren't founded until 1980| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| and originally didn't come into the town of Farragut until 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| But it's still in, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| If there's something in our jurisdiction that we need to be responsible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| we need to figure out what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| I think that's something that Darrell and Jim will have to get together with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| and discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Mr. Stone, in our discussion this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| I asked you if you were willing to make the statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| that the water issues currently in Brandywine, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| were not a result of the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| and would not be exasperated by the development of the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| Can you help me with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| Sure, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Yeah, I don't foresee any exacerbation of the drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| that the Brandywine folks have now with the development of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| I think the way the site lays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| and the way that we will work with Scott and his engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| we'll make sure that any site water that's generated from his site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| will be moved to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| and won't necessarily cause any harm to the folks in Brandywine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| I'm prepared to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| and this is after a great deal of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| with the HOA as well as the developer and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3746)|
| 1:02:36| My motion will be, due to the flooding concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| and the intensity of development on Fritz Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| I make the motion to approve the PR at the density of four and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| which is what is being asked, with four conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| The applicant agrees to submit and adhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| to the findings of a traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| So if I'm clear on that, if traffic impact letter says yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| ABC needs to be done on Fritz Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| in addition to what the county's already committed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| then that would have to be a condition of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| Is that correct, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| Say that one more time, Ms. Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| The applicant agrees to submit and adhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| to the findings of a traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| Yes, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| The applicant agrees to submit a stormwater management plan to EPW| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| for approval at the time of the grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| The applicant will agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| and I believe this is already in your code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| the applicant will agree to a 50-foot no-build buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| around the largest contour lines if Geotech determines sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| And the applicant will agree along the boundary with Brandywine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| to install a type A landscaping along that one boundary line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3848)|
| 1:04:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3864)|
| 1:04:32| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| Seeing none, Ms. Frazier, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| I would just ask that we also include that the left south lane turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| project be completed before building permits are issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3890)|
| 1:05:01| Whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| My issue with that is that it's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| sometimes even Mr. Stone doesn't have total control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| I'm not sure how I feel about delaying an entire project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| Mr. Stone, do you have any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| You know, and you're right, Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| one thing we haven't done a tremendous amount of here is utility coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| Those things outside our control, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| So, I mean, there could be delays associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| I would like to think that we would get this project done next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| but there's always the potential it could, you know, push that further out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| So, I mean, unfortunately I can't give you assurances that it will be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| next year, but I will assure you that I'll do everything I can to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| that goal within my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| All right, before we take this vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| is there any action that the applicant wants to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| I'm sorry, would you repeat that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| I said before we take this vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| is there any action that the applicant wants to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| The only thing I would mention is on the holding of building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| it's going to be a real problem financing a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| that is dependent on a public project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| That's what I worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| I would see that as problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| This family, I'm trying to get them paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| It's an estate that owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| I don't want to delay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| I don't think it will be a problem because it will be a year to build this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| thing once we get everything approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| and we haven't gotten the concept yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| Secondly, on the landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| I would like to ask that we consider type A landscape buffer is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| extremely expensive buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| I don't mind doing the evergreen trees along that boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| I would also point out that when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| although I've gotten to be friends with these folks in Brandywine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| when Brandywine was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| the people that have been in this family farm forever got no trees to screen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| So I don't have a problem doing the screening because I think it benefits my project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| and theirs, but I would like a little leeway on which screening type we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| It's A, B, or C with the planning commission, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| Everything else is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4065)|
| 1:07:53| At Brandywine HOA, are you satisfied with the proposal that's been presented by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4073)|
| 1:08:07| this developer in the boundary landscaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4087)|
| 1:08:21| I was just a little bit confused on the type of trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| how long they might take to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| Are they coming from seedlings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| Terry, speak into the mic, please, and your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| I was just kind of confused about the type of trees he was speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Were they going to be seedlings or were they going to be somewhat mature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| Everything else that you put into motion, we're good with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| I just wanted a little more knowledge as to what type of tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Mr. Smith, would you confirm head on the record then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| Five or six foot tall evergreens is what I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| And the spacing on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| There's B and C type screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| I don't remember the spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| I want to say, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I don't even guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| Amy, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Off the top of my head, I don't have the number right, but I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| You'll do it right, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| We will do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| We're going to go look at my other projects where we have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| and she will see what we'd like to do, and I think she'll be very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| I want to say they're space 10 feet or 15 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| but I don't want to guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| If I could just suggest something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| We all agree a landscape buffer needs to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| I think there's some confusion whether type A is right or type B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| I think that we will do a condition upon a landscaping buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| but let that be within the discretion of the professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| in evaluating what needs to be there and whether type A, B, or C is more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| I think typically on this type of development, they usually do a type B or C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| when you're doing residential to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| but I just don't feel like we're agreeing to a pig and a poke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| and I think maybe give them time to study that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| We'll also work with the community, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| as this moves forward with the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| Ms. Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Commissioner Daley, I overlooked your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| Got to get used to pushing that button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| Mr. Smith, did you not agree at one time to pay $100,000 for French Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| So a class A is nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| I'll stick with a class A. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| I'll tell you why I didn't do it in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| When we first talked to Mr. Snowden about the need for the interchange improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| which is a road that's under the jurisdiction of the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| it was clear to us that we didn't have to do this because we weren't in that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| but we agreed to do it with the understanding that this would be an interchange turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| When it came back, Scott Davis and I, and I want to say we put up $100,000 apiece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| but I don't remember the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| The design from the town of Farragut was $600,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| and that was just a whole lot more money than we were led to believe it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| So at that time, we wrote an email or a letter to the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| and said we would like to ask you to participate and we will match your participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| and they would not participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| They wouldn't put any money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| And that's how we ended up with the problem with that interchange or nobody funding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| I'd also point out, though, that I counted up the new houses that have just been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| over the past few years, Brandywine, Synesta, those other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| I think there's 378 new homes averaging half a million apiece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| generating around a million dollars in property taxes a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| Everybody blows that off, but that's a substantial amount of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| that new homes and new families are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| It should fund something, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| So it's not like, I mean, I'm just a private individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| I don't get the tax revenue back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| Okay, and thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| We're birdwalking a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Commissioner Daly, were you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| No, but I will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| I don't want to get in an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| We're addressing the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Madam Chair, I just asked for a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| Are you asking for a landscape screen on the property line of Brandywine and Ridgeland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4393)|
| 1:13:22| or is it and or or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| My motion on the type A was actually intended for Brandywine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| That did not rule out that planning would not also include whatever type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4412)|
| 1:13:40| that they decided on the Ridgeland side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| But I may reword that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| That was basically my same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Were you going to include that in your motion that includes a privacy screen for Ridgeland and Brandywine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4435)|
| 1:14:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| And let me commission our Director Brooks on that landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4448)|
| 1:14:24| Is it typically a B that you have on those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| We typically recommend B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| A B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| I don't have all the details of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| I'll restate my motion and move that to a B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| And it will still be your trees, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| It's still the trees for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| To restate my motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| Approval PR at four and a half per acre with conditions that the applicant agrees to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4496)|

| 1:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| We have a motion on the floor by Hill, second by Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| I feel like it's fair to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4550)|
| 1:15:59| This traffic study that we're going to ask Mr. Smith to do is going to show this turn lane is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| Based on my interpretation of the new offsite ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| then we will require Mr. Smith to build this turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| I want to make sure that Mr. Smith understands that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| because that would be my understanding of maybe Deputy Hall Director Moyers can clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4582)|
| 1:16:31| but that would be what I'm hearing here, and I want to make sure that I am reading that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Mr. Moyers, do you have any clarification on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| I don't have it in front of me, but that's my recollection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| is that if a traffic study indicates that after this we pass the new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| that says that if a traffic study indicates that road work is required by the new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| that the developer has to front the money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| That's my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| Now, I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| Unfortunately, I don't have it in front of me at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| but it does put some substantial liabilities on the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| I just want to clarify that, because there was some conversation about the exclusion of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| the work that were previously planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| so I want to make sure that this body directed my department in what your wishes were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| I'm good either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| You will continue what you already have on the books, is my interpretation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4652)|
| 1:17:42| Continue what you already have planned to begin in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4662)|
| 1:17:54| You can't be making a turn lane into a subdivision that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4674)|

| 1:18:01| I mean, Mr. Snowden can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| Have you addressed me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| All right, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| All right, help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| My understanding is that you have a project in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| We've seen the design on it that is Fritz Road on Fritz Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| Does that current plan include a turn lane or a dedicated entryway into that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4709)|
| 1:18:44| It does, but it's not completed at this point, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4724)|
| 1:18:54| and it's my interpretation of the ordinance that if this proceeds forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4734)|
| 1:19:04| and Mr. Smith does a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| then he will have to take over responsibility of that work that we're currently in process of doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| and that's what I wanted to make Mr. Smith aware of due to that substantial liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4754)|
| 1:19:21| That's my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| I could be wrong, but that was what I thought was going to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| I just wanted to be fully transparent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| You had said exclusive at one point, and I wanted to make sure that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| that you guys, that I understood what your intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| Mr. Smith, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| Yeah, if it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| Please, just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| I'm assuming there have been some traffic studies done on this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| I'm not sure why we're going to do another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| If I'm being asked to do a traffic study, which obviously has been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| if there's a project already on the drawing board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| is it going to make an assumption that that project is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| or is it going to assume that nothing, it's existing conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| And, I mean, I'm just trying to understand what is being asked of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| Because all we're going to end, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| would it assume that it's current conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| and when would this traffic study I'm being asked to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| when does it have to be ordered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| All right, and before I call on commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| I know I've got several items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Could you respond to that, Mr. Stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| Obviously, you know, some of that would be relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| to Mr. Smith's timeframe for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| We would allow a traffic study to be complete at any time during school periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| We wouldn't want it done during the fall, you know, the winter break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| And we would look at the study as if it is existing conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| even though it is in a transitional phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Mr. Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| As the second to the motion, I just want to make sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| is it your intent for the developer to pay the cost of this turn lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| Is that what we're trying to get to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Because I guess if the turn lane's already proposed to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| then I'm not sure why we need the traffic study in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| Because I would assume the purpose of the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| is to determine whether or not we need a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| And if we already have a turn lane proposed, I just, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| are we trying to get to something through the back door here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| No, I appreciate what you're saying because I was not aware that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| that specifically addressed an undeveloped subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| Sounds like it does, based on Mr. Snowden's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| I kind of feel like you're talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| So there is an existing turn lane that the county is working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| at the corner of Fritz and Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| When I heard your motion, it sounded to me like you would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| for a traffic study specific to that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| and if it is an additional turn lane that was needed to get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| and out of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| then that would be at the expense of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| If it is not, has nothing to do with the Campbell Station widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| Correct, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| Okay, so I think you're talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| Is that how I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| Okay, so you would need to do a traffic study as part of the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| for this neighborhood, and if that traffic study said you need a right-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| in or a right-hand out or something into your neighborhood off of Fritz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| then that would be at your expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| not having to do with anything with the intersection of Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| And that is not apparently what Commissioner or Director Snowden was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| Is that what you're thinking, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| We do need absolute clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Because you're already building the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| I was thinking that the concerns raised by the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| were primarily more focused up at Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| So that was my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| But I see the confusion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| My personal opinion is that you already have a project in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| You're buying right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| We've already allocated money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| You have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| That's in Knox County's bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| We made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| We're committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| And if it's a condition on this particular piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| as a traffic in and out or any additional things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| let that be tied to this piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| That's just my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| I was on the same line as Commissioner Bieler and Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| I kind of want to ask my question after you make your adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| I don't want to jump the gun or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| But I want to make sure that we're not lassoing everything in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| We are lassoing it in the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| So I'm going to hold off for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| I'm going to leave that button on all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| Director Brooks, do you have the screen pulled up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| different types of A and B, what the differences are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| With due respect, Mr. Commissioner Bieler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| before we revisit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| would you allow us just to complete this one line on the traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| And then I'll absolutely get back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| if you have another question on landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| would you be agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| For clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| my intention was what I also heard stated by Commissioner Bieler and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| And I think, well, I heard stated by the two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| I did not intend for that to be part of what is already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| regardless of how we got there, what was already in the bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| I hear what you're asking, Director Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| and I appreciate that you bring this up for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| So having said all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| would you like to speak now, Commissioner Woolhart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| I trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| I think you're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| My only question would be to the law director is if I think a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| that Commissioner Harrell is about to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5210)|
| 1:26:58| if the traffic study says anything about the turn lane down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| does that subsequently rope them into that turn lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| Now that I'm clear on what we're talking about, I think not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| Because that has already been determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| So any new traffic study would be on any conditions that are created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| now by this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| not that have previously been created by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| That was my only catch question. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| Is that your understanding, Commissioner Buehler and Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Quickly, did you have a comment, Mr. Mullins or Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| We're just making sure we understand that the condition would not include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| participating in the turn lane from Campbell and Fretz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| It would be any new condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| We would assume that condition was rectified by the Knox County project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| that is in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| And the scope is limited to a turn lane in and out of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| Well, no, I don't know what the scope's limited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| but it's whatever the traffic study determines as a result of you building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| your specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| But not, no, not including.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| Not including the interchange, basically as it relates to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Not including Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Whether I need a turn lane to get in and out of our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5305)|
| 1:28:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I will clarify that again when I reread my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| Now, getting back to Commissioner Daly, did you have a question on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| A new traffic study would show that Fretz Road's already been improved anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| so that shouldn't be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| Going back to, and we got to this issue on Fretz Road because Mr. Davison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| and Mr. Smith backed out a gentleman's agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| We passed an ordinance, didn't we, Jim, that this would not happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| We did, and that's why I'm sorry I let us down a rabbit hole there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| but that's why I wanted to make sure that I understood clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| what the recommendation of this body was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| So my apologies for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| So this commission passed the ordinance this year, I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| Just for clarification, there was a question about A and B screenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| I need to refresh your course on it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| So, Amy, the difference between A and B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| A is what's considered a dense screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| It's typically between commercial and industrial developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| adjoining residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| It includes, and you guys already discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| but evergreen trees typically six feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| They're continuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| It also can include an evergreen hedge, fence, wall, or earth berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| And the Type B is considered continuous as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| but there's a little bit more flexibility in what can be planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| So it should be a minimum of 12 feet in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| It can include offset rows of evergreen shrubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| or a continuous row of evergreen shrubs on a three-foot-high berm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| and also can be considered as a five-foot-high masonry wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| or timber fence with evergreen trees and low shrubs or climbing vines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| or one row of evergreen trees with branches touching the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5422)|
| 1:30:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| Are there any more comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Do I need to restate my motion with the conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| I see a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| Motion is the applicant agree we approve density at four and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5450)|

| 1:31:16| the development in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| The applicant agrees to submit stormwater management plan to EPW| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| for approval at time of grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| The applicant agrees to the 50-foot no-build buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| around the largest contour lines, geoservices to terms of sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| The applicant agrees to B landscaping classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5497)|
| 1:31:45| as a buffer around the entire perimeter of your boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| that faces existing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| And Commissioner Beeler's second is still standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Is there any more discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| I believe it was all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| Frazier and Daly in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| So the motion passes 9-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| Did I make a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5541)|

| 1:33:12| We will move that to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| I mean, to the next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| There are no zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| There are no amendments to county zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| Hold on one second, please, before we adjourn under other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| I do believe if you all direct yourself to the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| This is my ending tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| I want to introduce to you Dalton and Bradley Stills, our new grandsons of Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5625)|
| 1:33:55| So this is where she's been while we have all been wondering why in the world your chair isn't getting anything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5635)|
| 1:34:03| It's because she has been taking care of these babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| On that happy note, did you have an announcement, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| I'm going to tie a ribbon around that finger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Tomorrow is the first meeting of the advanced committee, 5 o'clock in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5658)|

| 1:34:26| But if you've got a chance, either watch it on TV or be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| Yes, I would encourage all of you to try to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023-zoning?start=5672)|
