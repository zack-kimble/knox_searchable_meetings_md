| 0:02:06| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=129)|

| 0:02:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Okay, any items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| I'd like to request that we postpone item 11A.B. and 11A.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| This is definitely a promising program, one with a great deal of positive benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=146)|
| 0:02:37| Council will have one vote on this half-billion dollar investment over seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| has done their part, but I believe Council needs to provide notice and public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| to encourage and invite our community to input on this, such an important project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| As such, I'm going to make a motion to postpone item 11AB and 11AC to our August 10th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=174)|
| 0:03:03| That would allow Council to have a public workshop on August 5th and give KUB time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| notify all of their rate payers by adding information into their insert of their billing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Those of you who served during the zoning code update, you might recall this sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| very similar to something I proposed during that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Okay, motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| I'm not sure about procedures, so Mr. Cross, if you would help me, but I respectfully ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| Councilman Roberto to take back your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| I think that we should have discussion tonight, and to me, that's where I'd like to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=219)|
| 0:03:48| is having discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| If we choose to postpone at that point, I would prefer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| I think that in accordance with what Councilperson Singh said, that's my inclination as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| I think we have the parties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| I think many of them are signed up to speak and ready to give a really good presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| So I think we should hear from the parties that are here, and after we get the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| and the statements that are made and after Council has discussions, if there seems to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| be a need for postponement, I think we can take it up at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| But I would be not in favor of postponing it without hearing from those who are signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| up to speak and here to give their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Council, Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| I would be in agreement with Councilmember Singh and Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| We have several people who have come today to speak on this item, so I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=283)|
| 0:04:50| reserve until we hear comments from all those who have shown up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Council Member Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| I would agree with Councilman Roberto, only because, yes, we want to hear from everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=299)|
| 0:05:10| but I do believe that there is a due process for the way we conduct our business, and typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=310)|
| 0:05:18| we have workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| We've had workshops about the Sports Authority before we created it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| We will have workshops before we vote on the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| We've had many a workshop, and the KUB Board approved this on June 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| We're asked to vote on it on June 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| Yes, KUB had its public process, but I think it's important for citizens to see us do our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| So, I would just request that we, that's why I seconded his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| I don't disagree that, you know, we should have had a workshop prior to this, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| have been conversations throughout the course of the last many months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| All the players are here tonight, and there are a lot of people that I know signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| and I think, you know, everyone is prepared to speak and answer questions that we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| You know, again, a lot of people are here tonight to speak on both sides of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| and so I feel like we need to at least honor that and hear it out, and then determine at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| that time if we need to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| I definitely appreciate what everyone's saying, and I know there's a lot of folks in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| room that there's a lot of interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| I think one thing I'd be worried about is that if we engage in the conversation this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| evening and, you know, we haven't gone through our public process, then, you know, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| think that's the right approach, and I think that's, we can see that in what we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| in many other things, and I think what Council Person Fugate just said is a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| There's been multiple workshops on other subjects that were not half-billion-dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| projects, so I do think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| I also would hate to have folks have to sit through an entire meeting and then do their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| have their comments again, so I do think it's important for public process, and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| suggest we vote on it now, and, you know, if it succeeds, fine, if it doesn't, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| we can go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| I was very pleased with my conversation with Mr. Bolas that we can actually accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| We can have inserts in all the bills that will go out within 30 days, we'll get to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| the ratepayers, we have already reserved time on August 5th, we can have a workshop, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| a good idea today will be a good idea in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| You bring up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Mr. Bolas is here and is prepared to answer all of Council's questions and share information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| the same exact information that many community members and Council members have heard at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| previous meetings for the last, over a year, and I think just the mention that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| of your discussion with him merits further discussion, and he would be willing, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| to give us a presentation when this comes up in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=509)|

| 0:19:36| I know that Councilwoman Ryder has done a lot of work on this, and she's analyzed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| and she feels that this is the best for that parcel in her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| I'm not going to oppose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| My concern is that if what's perceived as a similar situation occurs in the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1186)|
| 0:19:54| that this will somehow be used as a precedent, or for the sake of consistency, the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| will be made that the same action should be applied to a parcel that wouldn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| be identical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1207)|

| 0:22:18| I just have a question for Deputy Bray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| If you could explain, the outline is that this is going to be a city-county project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| Can you elaborate on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Yes, Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| This is actually a piece of property that there's a parcel that was transferred to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| city during the St. Mary's acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| We own the land, but there was a long-term ground lease with a real estate investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| organization that chose to sell that ground lease, and so they reached out to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| and to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Again, this is authorizing the Mayor to enter into an agreement to purchase this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| Knox County has expressed their interest in that acquisition at 50%, so this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1389)|
| 0:23:16| a 50-50 acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| This is just the first step in us actually digging into the inspection period, so signing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| the purchase and sale and ground lease termination agreement, which would allow us to initiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| a 90-day inspection period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Again, during that inspection period, if we find any issues with the property or we choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| not to move forward, we can do that during that window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| We're exploring how we would move forward with this project, but we don't want to miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| this opportunity with the acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Over the next 90 days, we'll be inspecting the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| We anticipate working through an intergovernmental agreement with Knox County and Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| and Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| We anticipate meeting with the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| We've already had some very preliminary discussions about the state entering into an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| to help meet the behavioral health, acute care health needs for North Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| This is an exciting opportunity, but we're in the early phases, so what you would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| is an intergovernmental agreement coming back for you as we work through that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| Knox County and Mayor Jacobs, and then hopefully some additional information about opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Yeah, it's just all the documentation, sites, the purchasers, the city of Knoxville, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| my question was what was the role slash investment of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Yeah, we would be the purchaser and the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| We're still working through the intergovernmental agreement with the details, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| And the lawyers will be helping us, Ms. Dyer, Mr. Mamentoff, and then obviously the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| over at Knox County and the county mayor's office, but the discussions to date have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| a 50-50 acquisition on all costs related to the acquisition, and then we're having discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| about what it could be with the health systems, with the three health systems, with the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| department, and with folks that could provide behavioral health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| So those are early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I mean, we've had several meetings, but we're still early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| We need to get in now while this building is up for sale, and we've got an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| to do those inspections and work through those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1517)|

| 0:25:30| partnership with the county and the city and the state, and I just want to preemptively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| applaud the intent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Homelessness is an issue in our city that we haven't solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| No city has, but one of the things we lack is a facility like this in that ecosystem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| of service, and I think substance abuse, behavioral health, all of those things are a huge gaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| need, and I just applaud the pursuit of doing this, not just at this location, but any location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| and to the extent the state can come in and help, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| Just one additional clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| So, the model that we have discussed with Knox County and Mayor Jacobs and with, very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| very early with the state is a dual system where you would have an acute care facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| that could meet the needs of North Knoxville, much like, it's not an emergency department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| but could meet those acute care needs, and then the behavioral health piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| So, it's both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| It's behavioral health and acute care, which I think are both missing from North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| Councilman Thomas' district, obviously, Councilwoman Ryder's district, when St. Mary's closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| when Nova closed, that ER served that function, behavioral health and acute care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| So, that's the discussion to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| It could change, but we'll be bringing back, I anticipate bringing back with Mayor Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| and Mayor Jacobs an intergovernmental agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Yes, this is something that I'm eager for us to explore further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| The area that in question, the old St. Mary's area, as it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| has a lot of potential to serve us in many different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| and the behavioral health aspect or acute care is one of the ways that it could possibly serve us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| And regardless, that parcel is also would be an important piece to obtain, if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1635)|
| 0:27:24| at reasonable cost, of course, just to have the option to do different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| But the original proposal is something that I look forward to exploring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| and, of course, there will be much more discussion about how it would fit in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| and exactly what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| But I appreciate the amount of work that the staff has done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| It's been very enjoyable to work with. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Thank you. Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| So, just to clarify for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| we're voting tonight just on the lease acquisition to take control of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| or the building on the property that we already own, not on what will actually happen there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1684)|
| 0:28:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| This is strictly an enter into a sale and ground lease termination agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| and we have 90 days during the inspection window that, again, for any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| if we choose not to move forward, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| So, we've got a lot of flexibility that's very favorable to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Okay. I just want to clarify that for the record. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Just wanted to clarify what section of the budget is this expense coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| So, we are exploring where to actually pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| So, I would anticipate potentially ARPA money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| but we are still working through what is allowable under the Rescue Plan Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| and you would need to see, when I see you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| the legislative body would need to see two things before we would close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| and Mr. Swanson or the mayor can correct me if I don't get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| but you would need to see an intergovernmental agreement with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| We've got to make sure that that is ironed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| and a budget amendment that would allow us to extend these dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| And so, the dollar amount, that's the amount that we're entering into that agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| but we've got to bring back those two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Intergovernmental agreement and a budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| should we choose to use ARPA or another funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| Thank you. Ms. Parker, did you have any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| So, to clarify, the city owns the land but doesn't own the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| I think there was a 99-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| It was a 50 with an additional, I believe, 50-year option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| so it goes, again, about 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| About 100 years. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| So, what we're really doing is buying out the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| so one thing I wanted to know, and certainly from previous questions in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| how old is this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| It is one of the newer buildings on the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| and I don't have the year in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| I want to say Mr. Askew is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| Do you remember the year that that was built, Mr. Jerry Askew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| No, sir. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Well, I tried to call a friend to get an answer, and it didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| Sometimes the lifelines don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| The lifeline did not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| I will get the year it was built to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Well, the reason I'm asking is just because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| certainly buildings of a certain age, you can see all kinds of things in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| So the final part to that is just, you know, who's doing the inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| what are you looking for, and just to put a pin on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| you know, if you find something, the city's not owing any money on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| We've got, again, the 90-day inspection period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| It was built in the year that we do not have to worry about some of the most obvious things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| like older buildings, asbestos, and other hazardous materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| but we do have a design firm that will be assisting us with the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| We noted that in AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| About, you know, $5,000 to $10,000 to have them go in and do a thorough inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| I'm not sure I can tell you what day or what year the building was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| but the original lease runs from 1999 forward, so I'm guessing it was very close to 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| So we're dealing with a prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Well, and certainly, you know, our community, our city needs acute care and behavioral health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| so I think that's a good project going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Just wanted to double-check, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Thank you, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Oh, Ms. Parker, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Well, I just wanted to explain my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| I feel the need to abstain on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| I, of course, support any efforts to move towards creating more services like these in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1917)|
| 0:32:07| because they are absolutely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| What I'm struggling with is more information of knowing whether this is the property that needs to be purchased for that service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1930)|
| 0:32:19| and whether this is the right price point for that property to house that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| And so that's what I'm struggling with, and also not knowing where the money is going to come from in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| Hopefully, it is ARPA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| So for that reason, I need to abstain on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| We'll just do that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1963)|

| 0:32:51| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a fifth amendment extending the lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=1971)|

| 0:34:31| It's just that I have questions about, we're talking about four to five times what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| voted on earlier, the amount, this item and the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| And we've had quite a few things, especially with the public safety building, where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| as a council approved one cost and then what we end up with is much more costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| So I wanted to ask Mr. Cannon if you could explain why that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| On this specific project, as you know, it is basically, and you probably have a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| history than me, but I will do my best, in that this project has been evolving as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| relationship and flexibility that TDOT allows us to have through that corridor has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| There is no budget increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| This comes out of the phase two dollars that were appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| I'm going to lean on Deputy Mayor Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| I believe that was ten million dollars for that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| So this is not an increase and it is a request of the state to verify that what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| to that structure will not hamper it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Frankly, I think the results are going to be more than positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| When you're talking about putting a greenway on a bridge deck, number one, it's unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| It's going to be a phenomenal vantage point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| The second is we're also taking truck traffic off of that portion of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| But it is a necessary, in fairness to TDOT, for their stewardship to the Federal Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| Administration for us to go through that exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| There's no budget increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| This is just a matter of an item that TDOT must require of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| Councilwoman, just very quickly, the key point on that is there was an existing budget, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| the scope of work for Vaughn and Melton changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| We said, hey, we now need you to study a section of this bridge because the state has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| allowed us to go potentially across it for a greenway connection across this large bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| across the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| So we have asked them to do this additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| So it hasn't gone over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| We have just asked them to do a little bit more than we originally thought, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| still within that large capital item for the Gateway Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| Okay, that item has not increased from ten million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| It's still part of that ten million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Thank you, Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2221)|

| 0:37:51| Do you have a question or do you want Mr. Cannon to sort of give an overview of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| I'll let Mr. Cannon give an overview and I might add something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Mr. Cannon, if you could just elaborate a little bit about the nature of this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| The design of the First Creek Greenway has been a collaborative effort with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| itself and our consultant team, and there's been various alternatives looked at to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| how could we make this a gateway, if you will, for what could happen down the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| Broadway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| We have cantilevered greenway over the creek, First Creek, in that area to maintain distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| of the traffic from the pedestrians and the cycling public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| Two of the things that it was agreed on with the community that we needed to add to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| project is mast arms for the signal heads because the poles that will be down through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| there will be gone because of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| And it's the right entrance, if you will, into that Broadway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| The second thing is that we are adding in stamped asphalt crosswalks, which will necessitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| some ADA work on the other side of the street again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| We want to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| We want it to be a gateway, an example of what can be done in that area, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| the reason for this change order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Yeah, I just want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| This is the third time we've voted on changes to the design for this, and to clarify for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| my colleagues why that is and why some of the enhancements to the crosswalk there, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| The original design put the greenway abutting the traffic, and the community doesn't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| There's been some issues at other greenways that parallel Broadway as a sidewalk where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| cars have jumped off and almost hit people on the curb, and so I don't feel that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| a design that we need to spend money and invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| The second design was for a version that would have been the best version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| We just weren't going to be able to afford the right-of-way acquisitions, and I spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| a year trying to work with one property owner that was willing and one property owner that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| was not, and to see if they would be on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| That option is just not going to be affordable because of right-of-way, so this is our third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| option that will make it affordable, so though it appears that we're spending more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| to redesign it, yet again, it is because when we got to the right-of-way part of it, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| would have ballooned the cost of it if we'd have gone with option, the second version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| So this is going to get us closer to something that's reasonable and attainable for us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| be a real boon to connecting Fulton, the library up at Edgewood, that park down to Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2436)|
| 0:40:44| and these are highly trafficked, highly walkable areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| And then in terms of the ADA crosswalks, for everyone that might not be familiar with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| area, the Broadway towers there across the street, and a lot of those residents walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| over to get their groceries, and many people in the area walk to the grocery there in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| that shopping center to use it, and we've actually had pedestrian incidents and deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| and injuries in those crosswalks, so just high pedestrian and high-speed traffic are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| a bad recipe, and so we're trying to make it so it's a safer area for people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| actually going to use these crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2481)|

| 0:49:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| We had a workshop on the plan and presented these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2957)|

| 0:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Any further questions or discussion on Item 11L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| Oh, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Ms. Wade, would you mind talking about how these agencies were chosen to get the funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| We have an application process for our federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| That application was advertised and posted in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| We take applications through February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| We provide two technical assistance workshops to any agency that wants to apply for funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| where we provide assistance on how to fill out the application, what the federal requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| are, and assist them, basically, in getting us an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| So all these agencies applied for funding with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| My concern is just I have no issue with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| This is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| But my issue is there are a lot of smaller agencies that just don't have the competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| edge as some of the larger ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| And I know that these guys do a very good job, but in building smaller nonprofits, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| when they are community-based, they often have a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| They don't have as many grant writers or the funds to build up their foundation before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| they can apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| So that's just something I'm hoping we take into consideration in trying to build up more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| nonprofits that are more community-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| I understand that, and we hope to fund a few smaller nonprofits that we have not funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| before with federal funds with the local dollars that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| We have some local dollars focused on homelessness that we can use for those agencies that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| not be completely ready to take on federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| There are requirements with those that are sometimes a little onerous, and we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| make sure that everybody's successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3084)|

| 0:51:29| Director, I just, what you were talking about at the end, there are federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| requirements that must be met for any subrecipient of federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| So I just wanted that to be clear, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| This is not, we make up the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| This is, if you're taking federal funds, there are federal requirements, and that's why you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| said we might look at our own funds to help others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3114)|

| 0:55:47| I've been there with my kids for many, many years, and I know some have many other families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| with and without children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| It's a really wonderful park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| But as we all know, maintaining the park has become increasingly expensive, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| managing the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| So when the Lions Club asked us for assistance, we've been glad to help them, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| been able to, we are here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| We are committed to making sure the Fountain City Park remains a gathering place for many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| generations to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Just a few items to note before you all vote or as you discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| The Lions Club will retain their main building in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| The city has committed more than a million dollars to improve the water quality of Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| City Lake and to improve amenities in the park, and the recently adopted budget includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| another $250,000 to improve the playground, including bringing it up to Americans with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| Disabilities Act accessibility standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| New funding also will improve the walking path through the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| So thank you to all the members of the Lions Club for maintaining with such loving care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| this park for so many years, and we are happy to take over now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| Mr. Brace, did you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Ms. Ely, I believe Mr. Hensley was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| I don't think he had signed up, but he had...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| Is there someone here from the Lions Club who is available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| He's available to speak, and I think he drove up from Atlanta to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| He was on assignment in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| If Council doesn't mind calling and listening...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| Well, I turned my light on to ask if there was anyone from the Lions Club here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| Please, I'll speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Mr. Hensley, would you like to come to the microphone, the podium, across the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| Yeah, Mr. Hensley, if you could just start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| and thank you for taking your time to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| Yeah, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| I'm Mike Hensley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| I live in Fountain City on Kesterbrook Drive, and we want to thank the Mayor and the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| Council and Cheryl Ely very much for what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| It's been a long time to get to this point, but the Lions Club has been doing this for 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| My grandfather was a founding member of the Lions Club out there, my father, my uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| We've all been members there, even my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| And then I've been president of the Fountain City Land Company, which on paper owns the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| but it just became so onerous to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| I mean, it's a group of men and women that just try to, for charity purposes, to raise dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| to maintain the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| But really, we're in the eyeglass business and we're in the bicycle business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| not really the maintaining park business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| So it became such a burden, really, and we really appreciate you all willing to take this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| And I think it's going to continue to be a great asset for Fountain City and also for the city itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| So we're just excited to be a part of all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| I just want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Yeah, Mr. Hensley, did anyone else from the Lions Club come here this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| No, ma'am, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| No representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| I know I see a couple of Fountain Cityans out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| I don't know if anybody else is here, but I don't know if that's why you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| Well, Dan Ray was scheduled to come, and he's an attorney to help with some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| He's the president of the Lions Club, but he's been very ill, and so he was not able to make it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| So he asked me to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| And Mr. Hensley, I don't know if this is a question you can answer or if it's better for Ms. Ely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| Can you clarify for the audience and everyone, there's a lot of misunderstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| a lot of people didn't realize for a long time, forever, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| but that is not a city park until we make this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| It is in perpetuity then a private park in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| Can you comment on how the land came to be and how the park came to be briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| You're going to do a better job than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| The Lions Club began in 1946.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| I'm not exactly sure the transition of the park to the Lions Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| but the Fountain City Land Company on paper owns it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| and somehow I ended up with my name on there as the president of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| I didn't realize what I was signing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| You didn't sign something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Oh, I did sign something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| I didn't know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| But anyway, the point is that that transition as to when that actually happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| since 1946 I think the Lions Club has been the stewards of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| And when anything good or bad happened, a lot of times the city would get blamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| and the Lions Club would get blamed or get credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| So it was just time to where we were doing chili dinners and pancake dinners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| And they're delicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| Yeah, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| But just to really kind of keep the whole thing going and try to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| and there's a bunch of men and women, I just call them a bunch of do-gooders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| that just worked hard as best they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| A lot of them had retired, and this is kind of what they did to kind of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| And those of us that still worked really couldn't do too much other than just kind of support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| So over a period of time it just got too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| And some of the upgrades were needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| I know I met with Cheryl and she was saying, well, Mike, we think it needs this much of repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| I said, I hope you have that budget because we don't have that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| And so we just kind of worked through all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| So that's a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| There's a lot of history there, but that's a little bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Well, I'm going to say I regret that I didn't read anything by Dr. Tumblin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| to be prepared tonight to speak about the history to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| I don't know if Ms. Ely wants to jump in on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| I do want to thank publicly Ms. Ely and the mayor for working with the Lions Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| This has been a long process and meetings over a considerable amount of time since I've been on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| to come to the agreement to transfer this to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| And it's a great park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| It's a memory for a lot of people who have taken their kids there, gone to Fountain City Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| which is a big event, as well as many of the Lions Club's events there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| My understanding of the park is 1800s maybe or early 1900s, well before you guys took possession of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3679)|
| 1:01:27| And I want to address this for the public because there were some questions I saw on social media this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| That land was deeded to be in perpetuity a park, and it cannot be something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| So it has to be a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| So for anybody who had concerns that it's somehow going to become something else after it transfers to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| that is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| It is a park and was deeded to be such, which is the land company you're speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| And with your help, we were able to get that done because there has been a lot of questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| You know, the city may do this or may do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| But, I mean, it's just because there's a lot of pride in that park and a lot of history in that park and in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| So it's a park for the city, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I mean, it's just a wonderful place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Well, I appreciate your work and everyone at the city and Ms. Ely and the mayor and her staff are working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| so we can get, you know, you guys some help in how to maintain things and put some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| and get things up to speed and ADA compliant and work on the walking paths and the roofs on a few of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| and a couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| So I'm looking forward to it and maybe we'll have some ribbon cuttings or something there as things progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3755)|

| 1:02:38| The park and the lake is such an integral part of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| It's hard to imagine Fountain City without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I don't think it would actually be like Fountain City without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| And it's something I've enjoyed and my neighbors enjoyed for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| and this action should enable everyone to enjoy it for many more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3776)|

| 1:03:38| Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| Thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| Please start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| My name is William Anderson III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| I live at 1805 Asrock Drive, which is not in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| It's across the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| But I own property in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| But I'd like to say that I grew up in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| I played ball in the city before integration at Claude Walker Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| Well, really, Cal Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| And although you say a park can't be changed, that land was donated by Cal Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| the first black millionaire in Austin, to always be for colored recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| When they put Neyland Drive through, the city made a park and called it Claude Walker Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| And he was the deputy recreation director for colored recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| And I'm lucky enough to be old enough to remember some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| But I've been involved in the athletic program there for roughly 40 years, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| And I think it's a blessing if it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| I can't believe that we were fortunate enough to have donors give that much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| and the additional work the city is doing in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| This has been a real trying year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| And it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| Our children have struggled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| But I appreciate everything you're doing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| Because the children deserve the best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| And I need to leave because I'm breaking up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3942)|

| 1:05:53| Thank you, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Council, before you start your discussion, I just want to sort of echo something of what Mr. Anderson commented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| This is a $1.6 million gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| That's not just an investment in a city park, but it really is an investment in our young people who definitely deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| It's going to be a state of the art turf for both fields adjacent to Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| as well as improvements to lighting, fencing, and hitting and pitching lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| It will serve both softball and baseball, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| This also comes with a recurring operational investment that will go towards items such as uniforms and equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| along with additional operations support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=3989)|

| 1:06:49| I think this may be directed to Mr. Brace, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| There's been a few comments and questions regarding the relationship with Jim Development and Emerald Youth Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4013)|
| 1:07:01| And I want to just confirm that Emerald Youth Foundation will serve as the fiscal agent, if you will, regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4027)|

| 1:07:15| Yeah, and I believe that Mr. Randall Thurman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| There's Mr. Thurman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4041)|

| 1:07:31| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| And I'm glad that you recognize Mr. Thurman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| I did also want to bring everyone's attention, and I'm very grateful that I think we were intentional on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| to have a minority-owned business being the general project manager on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| And so congratulations to Mr. Thurman and look forward to all the improvements that our young people in the East Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4068)|
| 1:07:56| and across the city will enjoy as a result of this investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4076)|

| 1:10:34| Not only does the river line offer opportunities for equitable access and experiences on the Tennessee River for 200,000 residents of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4234)|
| 1:10:43| but also the city of Knoxville is the trailhead community that will welcome generations of adventure seekers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| as they begin their 652-mile journey on the Tennessee River Line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| So we appreciate the support and the investment of the community, the interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| and the belief in this vision that we've received from my home community and from our trailhead community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| Could you state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Sure, Brad Collett, 7000 Wellington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| Any questions for Mr. Collett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Any further comments or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| Any opposed? Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| 11X is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| and accept the 2022 Project Safe Neighborhoods grant from the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| in the amount of $142,948 with no required local match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| for funding to upgrade the Knoxville Police Department's crime analysis capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| equipment, and necessary task force overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| as it relates to reducing violent crimes, gun-related offenses, human trafficking, and drug trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Motion made to approve and seconded. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| All of these grants, if we receive them, this is in addition to what is budgeted for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4319)|
| 1:12:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| I would love a report sometime on how much the police department actually does end up getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| between the budget and the grants that they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| The grants that have been awarded, I can give you those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| I don't have them here tonight, but we do keep track of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| These that we're talking about tonight, of course, have not been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| Some of them are two-year grants, as this first one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| It's actually to be expended over two years, and so some of them go over a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4362)|
| 1:12:50| There's been a lot of news on the police department that's pretty disturbing in the last couple weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| and I think we need to address that at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| This particular grant is heavy on training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| That hopefully will ease your mind a little bit, but this particular grant is heavy on training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| Two different topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you, Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| I just wanted to respond to something that was just brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| I thought we had discussed in the past the general practice of how KPD budgets are developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4398)|
| 1:13:33| and I thought most of the grants that are sought are already budgeted into the budget, but that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4413)|
| 1:13:44| None of this is currently budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| Chief Thomas, I believe that we can't budget them unless we even apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| We're seeking your approval to apply for the grant, and then Chief Thomas, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| Right, and so as we apply for them, we apply for certain things to do with that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| and we are evaluated on making sure that we spend the money in the manner that we applied for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| I appreciate Councilmember Singh's question because that is a different understanding than I previously had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| so I also would appreciate that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| I mean, just even thinking about our end-of-the-year financial report, it doesn't seem that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4457)|
| 1:14:27| Mr. Brace, if you could elaborate on that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| Grants that we have received, and Ms. Juneau can correct me, if we've received a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| so let's say we get a million-dollar grant, $200,000 a year over five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| that would be included in the budget as a revenue source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| But this is a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| We have grant opportunities throughout the city that come in throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| and we seek those grants throughout the year to try to secure those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| For example, there's this infrastructure bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| There may be opportunities for engineering to apply for dollars through the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| So those are always ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| Police Department and other individuals at the city are always seeking revenue opportunities, grant opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| But if we've secured a grant, Ms. Juneau, and it is a known amount of revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| we would include that in our budget documents, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| Just speak right into the mic and we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| Yes, the grants are reported separately, and the question may be really around the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| The regular police operations are budgeted through the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| and the grants are separate, and that may be worth some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4539)|
| 1:15:47| Council Member Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Thank you. Just a point of clarification, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| When we apply for a grant, are they oftentimes maybe not even awarded until the following fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4552)|
| 1:16:01| I mean, so I assume we may – the grant process can take a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| so we may be giving authorization to apply now for funds that will be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| perhaps to be used in our next fiscal year or later this year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| Correct. A couple of these, like this one, we would not get until October, and it's a two-year grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| The very last one that we'll talk about actually won't be awarded for three years into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| Thank you, Chief Thomas. Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Yeah, so Chief Thomas, can I just ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| I'm looking at the information here in the AIS where it's – make sure I'm on the right one – where 11X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4600)|
| 1:16:47| X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| This grant is funding for – this grant will allow KPD to upgrade crime analysis capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| equipment, and fund necessary task force overtime as it relates to reducing violent crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| gun-related offenses, human trafficking, and drug trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| So can you give us any kind of example of what the crime analysis capabilities – I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| What's appropriate to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| So our crime analysis right now – we're behind on technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| So it's software to make all of the information that we take in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| We can put that all together and pull out what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| For example, if we get a request for how many car burglaries are happening between certain hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| and places in comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| So this allows us to pull that data more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| So a lot of it is for software, which is always improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| So that falls under the umbrella of equipment as well, or does that involve, like, maybe computers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| Forensic equipment is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| When we go out and we have – we've got a machine, and I don't know what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| It gets updated every year, but it's a 3D analysis of the crime scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| Rather than our forensics techs having to go measure each individual thing, this machine sits in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| It's a sphere and measures everything automatically for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| So it's a much more efficient way of mapping a crime scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Just one other question to help clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| So the work included in this grant, if the grant is not awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4702)|
| 1:18:30| would we still fund the necessary task force overtime as it relates to this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| or would this work not happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| If we don't have the overtime, it won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| The task forces are still available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| You know, I mentioned the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| So the training for the task forces into gang investigation, the GRATE program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| gang resistance education and training, advanced homicide investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| and CEPT, crime prevention through environmental design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| those are specific trainings that we are trying to get for those task forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| that would be funded through this grant should we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| Does that answer your question, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| And what would the overtime pay be for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| That would be for these task forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| If they do go out and investigations go into overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| we can use this grant to fund that overtime rather than our overtime budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| But if we need to do the work, we will use our overtime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| We'll get, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4767)|

| 1:20:33| Any council members saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| This is a program I support a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| It's very good, the CIT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| If we do not get this grant, how much funding goes to that training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4841)|
| 1:20:48| So that's difficult to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| This money would allow us to work with a master's level clinician to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4851)|
| 1:20:59| follow-up on our co-responder program, follow-up services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| And it also has a research component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| And so part of that is we would coordinate with UT to have a graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| student do that research component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| So this would be actually enhancing our CIT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| It's not providing additional CIT training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Then I was – I did not understand that this had to do with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| co-responder model at all, just with the eight hours every officer gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| and then the 40 hours that they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| We'll still get that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| And we still – we take part in that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| So we have never been turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| We have always – everybody who has applied for that CIT certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| the 40-hour course, has always been able to go to that certification training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| And we will continue to give the 24 hours in the academy that we do for every academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| So that will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Is there an incentive to do the 40 hours over the eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| The 40 hours of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Is there an incentive to do that over the eight hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| How do we encourage more officers to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| So the 40 hours is actually a certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| And so officers who are interested in that certification will apply for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| and interview for that with our CIT members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| And so then they will go for that certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| and they actually get to wear the pin on their uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| We have about 80 members right now who have that certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| which is a little more specialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| So we have somebody available all the time who is certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| I've got one for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| Thank you, Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4953)|

| 1:22:46| and all documents necessary to jointly apply with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| for the 2021 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| of $149,527 from the U.S. Department of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| for improved operation of the criminal justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| and if such application is approved, authorizing the mayor to accept the grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Councilmember Parker and then Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| Just if you could talk about the training and updated technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| that will be a part of this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| So this is the grant, I think, that you were concerned with before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| that gives us a little bit of leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| And this we actually apply for with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| so we have to share that amount with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| I'm not quite sure how much of that we will get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| But the type of training we are talking about is actually bike patrol training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| for our community engagement and response team members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| as well as bikes to supply to them, which are quite expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| And there is a police mountain bike association certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| that we'd like to have a couple of them go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| so they can maintain those bikes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| For forensics, it was, again, some specialized equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| that our forensics techs may need, a lot of technology involved there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| even in just lifting fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| And, again, the CERT team, the bike equipment was the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| Thank you, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| My question was answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5054)|

| 1:24:22| Council, I'd like to call a 10-minute recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| so we can have a recess before we have a longer discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| 734, we'll reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Okay, we are going to reconvene the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Welcome back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5075)|

| 1:25:18| been talking about on the campaign trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| and I'm really pleased that we're going to be discussing it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| at more length again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5123)|

| 1:25:29| and the surrounding communities who have stayed engaged on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| for months and years, and they've provided a lot of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| some of which is included in this hefty binder that shared a lot of input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5138)|

| 1:25:52| So thank you for all those who contributed to this public input process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| Thank you for the insights shared with KUB and council members and me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| as they developed a plan to provide for fiber services to homes and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| And council members, I want to thank you for the time you have all put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| to understanding this proposal and how it can address such a critical need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| As I've listened to constituents and local businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| and learned the details of KUB's pragmatic, thoughtful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| and forward-looking approach, it's clear to me that this is a critical opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| for the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| The pandemic made more clear than ever that high-quality internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| is a universal need, just like electricity, just like water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| and wastewater services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| Regardless of where you live, you need internet access to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| And unfortunately, too many in our community don't have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| high-quality options as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| Just like those other utility services, like electricity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| KUB's public utility model can meet that need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| filling gaps and providing a high-quality option to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| As a public utility, KUB will have an obligation to offer services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| to each and every customer with rates, just like their other utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| that are predictable and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| And all of this is an opportunity unlocked by KUB's already planned investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| in our electricity grid, which will increase reliability, efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| and help make sure our infrastructure is ready for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| These are all great things for our city, and we've seen what universal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| high-speed internet access can do for communities like ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| from an economic perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Let's seize this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5248)|

| 1:28:57| As I begin my statement about this KUB issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| I would ask that those in this audience who approve and stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5341)|

| 1:29:13| In the beginning, man discovered this thing called fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| This discovery opened a whole new world to humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| Now we can see where we're going at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| and we can cook the meat that we've been eating raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Humankind advanced, and we were able to use oil lamps and candlesticks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| Then came electricity and the light bulb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| and now we can see for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5371)|

| 1:29:36| Now comes fiber technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| and with it comes the opportunity for more growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| one that can reach the highest mountains and down into the lowest valleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| We need this, and we need you to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| As we present our ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| we take a moment to acknowledge the work of this history-making council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| This council will go into the history books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| as having made some of the most courageous and positive decisions for our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| since it was founded in 1786 as a leading distribution city in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5400)|

| 1:30:07| using Zoom and in-person meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5407)|

| 1:30:31| and now an attack on our very right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5431)|

| 1:31:16| that has existed for far too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5476)|

| 1:31:35| We need to be in front of the eight ball on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| Delay means we lose a window of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| for our students of every race and gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5501)|

| 1:31:48| that are being used so you can actually see those patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5508)|

| 1:31:54| to be seen no matter where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Delay means more and more of our talented young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| leaving our cities to get the type of high-paying jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5519)|

| 1:33:26| Mayor Bailey, would you come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| and state your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| Thank you, Mayor Kincannon and the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| My name is Jason Bailey. I am the mayor of Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| Your neighbor's just next door here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| and I'm here to ask for your support with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| and I'll tell you, you're a tough act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| But anyway, I'll get to it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| The fine residents of Union County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| elected me as their county mayor about three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| And I'll tell you, folks, Union County has been in need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| of high-speed, reliable high-speed Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| for about 20-plus years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| During my campaign, the number one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| that I heard from my constituents in Union County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| was, we need things for our kids to do, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| I'm taking care of that. The county has the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| The next, broadband Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| I get calls all the time from my office, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| They call my office asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| why can Union County not have broadband Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| just like the larger cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| And my answer is always, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| Why? Why can't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| Why can't Union County have the opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| and the broadband infrastructure that other counties have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| Well, to be honest, when I asked this same question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| to some of the local providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| the answer that I would get sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| is it doesn't follow our business plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| our business model to provide broadband Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| access to rural communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| Folks, Union County is a rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| That's my whole entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| So that's not the answer that I wanted to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| To be honest, the folks in Sharpstaple, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| which is a large majority of my county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| are benefiting from Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| through Powell Valley Electric Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| who is doing basically the same thing that KUB is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Like I said, that literally covers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| 80 percent of my county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| If KUB is able to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| this will cover, again, outside of Sharpstaple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| 80 percent of my county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| Honestly, 80 to 85 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| Two small areas of my county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| are covered by two other utility districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| in which it won't cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| but we have a plan to try to help those folks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| And I'll tell you, folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| before becoming mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| I spent 15 years in the Union County public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Some of those years as a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| most of those years as a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| At school, I always ask my teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| that when you are giving assignments to children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| please remember, try not to give assignments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| that require Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| Why is that? Because our students couldn't do that at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| The largest majority of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| So, fast forward a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| I'm the mayor. A global pandemic hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| So, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Our students and our teachers go home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| to work from home and to learn from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| Well, I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| My student, or my child, excuse me, my son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| is a 6th grader going into 7th grade this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| He was given a Chromebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| as was every single child in Union County public school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| We're given a Chromebook to take home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| That's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| But my son was able to do all of his homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| with the high-speed Internet at our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| Even if we didn't have the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| I'm a teacher. I could help my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| But literally, two miles up the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| there were students that had no Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| Zero folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| No access to Internet at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| And, of course, they didn't have a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| So, I sat there thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| we can do better. We can do better as a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| to help our students and to help our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| So, as the mayor said just a second ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| if this pandemic taught us one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| it's that Internet is a necessity, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| It is an absolute necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| And by giving Union County other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| and in many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| our only option for Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| will be a game-changer for our small county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| It literally will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| Reliable broadband Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| will bring much-needed economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| more educational opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| and just simply get our people connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| in Union County. It's what we're after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| So, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| just like me, you were elected to represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| the fine citizens of this great city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| but I also ask you tonight to please consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| the areas outside of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| that this will also affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Please just keep in mind the folks in Union County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| and other counties that KUB will serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| that literally have absolutely no access to Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| There are several rural areas in our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| that can't even get cell phone service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| but you know what they do have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| They have KUB running through their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| and they can have Internet through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| So, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| if I can ever be of any assistance to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| in Union County, just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| I thank you for your time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| Have a great night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Thank you, Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| The next person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| signed up to speak on this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5870)|

| 1:37:56| Is Mr. Kessler here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| You could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| and start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| and you will have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5884)|

| 1:38:16| 1237 Harrington Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| and I'm a research professor at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| and KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| I recently performed a study for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| to look at the economic benefits of their plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| and I just wanted to go over a couple of the highlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| of the report, which was released yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| So, the main finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| was that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| we estimate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| if 35% of households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| were to switch to KUB's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| Internet plan, which, according to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| business proposal, is $65 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| that the cost savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| would lead to an $18.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| to $85.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| increase in Tennessee incomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| per year. So, and the reason that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| range is so big is just because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| current Internet plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| have various costs, so just comparing the various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| costs of the different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| And the driving force is both the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| savings as well as the multiplier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| effect, where households will then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| take those savings and they'll spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| that money within the local community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| buying other goods and services, and that'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| boost incomes for everybody in the region as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| So, we also believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| the 35%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| take-up rate, that's assumed by KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| in their business proposal, and we assume that in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| study as well. We feel that that's extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| conservative, and I think it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| to be conservative here because we don't want to overstate anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| but if you look at other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| cities with municipal broadband, such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Chattanooga or in Illinois, Highland, Illinois,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| they have take-up rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| in excess of 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| So, in that regard, it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| seem like our estimate is a lower bound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| And then the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| part of the study, it looks at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| just a bunch of academic research that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| already been out there that looks at how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| expanding high-speed Internet access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| to residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| to homes, as well as increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| speeds for home Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| they both have a number of really strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| positive benefits, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| increasing regional GDP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| as well as for unemployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| people, decreasing the amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| it takes for their job search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| There's also a number of really strong positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| benefits for education and health outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| as well, which we document in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| So, for that reason, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| there's just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| KB proposal I think just offers a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| of positive benefits to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| as a whole. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| Thank you, Mr. Kessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6030)|

| 1:40:46| Hello, my name is Dr. Adrian Del Maestro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| I'm at 1425 Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6048)|

| 1:40:52| I moved here in September 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| from Burlington, Vermont, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| I'm here to express my strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| support for the KB proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| I'm a professor of physics and astronomy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| and I was recruited from the University of Vermont| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| to move to Knoxville to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| cluster around research and teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| in quantum materials for future technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| In Burlington, I had access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| public broadband, symmetric one gigabit per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| second internet, equal upload and download| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| speeds, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| for a very competitive price. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| to say I was reasonably disappointed when I purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| my house in Knoxville and realized that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| essentially serviced by a monopoly and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| couldn't achieve one gigabit per second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| symmetric internet at any price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| no matter how much I wanted to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Moreover, I learned that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| that was essential to my work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| and research, especially during the transition to the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| which was the availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| of a second static IP address, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| paid $5 a month for in Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| through my public broadband, was not available, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| at any price here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| KB's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| proposal is, I would say, exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| and forward-thinking, and it will bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| Knoxville in line with the 700 communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| nationally that have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| public internet that have been extraordinarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| happy with that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| As we heard from other speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| I think now we all understand that internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| access is an essential service akin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| to water and power that Knoxville households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| cannot reasonably forego without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| inflicting real social and economic harms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| on themselves, even when the pandemic isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| raging outside their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| At the recent KB Community Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| we saw very broad support from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| for all types of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| I'd like to just outline the three reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| I feel most strongly about about why this is a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| proposal. Those are freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| equity, and competitiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| in the ability to accelerate science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| Freedom from monopoly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| Cable and telecom monopolies have basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| divided the country into regions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| with, at best, duopoly, at worst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| complete monopoly. This allows abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| of customers, and I think we all saw this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| recently when the Frontier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| bankruptcy proceedings became public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| and customers that were in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| monopoly were specifically targeted at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| that prices could be raised for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| Domestic surveillance. KB certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| doesn't sell our usage of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| and power to third parties without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| our consent. This is definitely not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| the case for private ISPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| Private ISPs are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6188)|

| 1:43:24| For this reason, I think this is an area where there can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| really broad consensus across the political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6206)|

| 1:44:04| has an opportunity to address this with KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| and they can specifically say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| support the ideas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6248)|

| 1:44:12| the current broadband providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6252)|

| 1:44:32| competitiveness. In my last meeting, slow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6272)|

| 1:44:52| the quality of engaging demonstrations that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6292)|

| 1:44:56| to say double if I could even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6296)|

| 1:45:22| to stress here, is that this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| just about downloading movies faster or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| having cheaper internet. Having the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| to have cutting-edge broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6328)|

| 1:46:08| business with big reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6368)|

| 1:46:12| We are in 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6372)|

| 1:46:18| different consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6378)|

| 1:46:22| before it became cool in the last year to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| strictly online business and we will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6384)|

| 1:46:28| Now I'm here to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| proposal because it is absolutely critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| to the way that we do business and the way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| business has moved recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| So our business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| as a company is a decentralized one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| We don't have a central office. We each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| work out of our own homes and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| exactly what's happened over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| the past years. All of these workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6406)|

| 1:47:00| word there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6420)|

| 1:47:32| dropping and then it completely shuts off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| So I have to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6454)|

| 1:48:02| we can have someone out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| next Wednesday maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| With KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| I've never had to wait more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| a couple hours for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| When I call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| them up, when I call up Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| I usually get one of their support agents in the Philippines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| on the phone. Whenever I call KUB I've got someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| right here in Knoxville and they take care of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| problem right away. I'd love to be rid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| of these problems but just like the previous speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| I live in Holston Hills and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| one option. I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| called for support the other day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Comcast thanked me for being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| customer for 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| It's not because I've had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| option to go anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| It's an absolute monopoly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| They've had 23 years to fix these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| problems and they're still happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| Now with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| symmetrical internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| KUB would have us at 125| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| megabytes a second upload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| speeds. Right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| with Comcast I'm maxed out at 4.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| megabytes per second. That's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| you can get. You can pay all the money in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| and you can't get higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| I literally had to make a movie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| the other day to send to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| on the other side of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| I saw how long it was going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| Two hours. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| had to plug it in to an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| external hard drive and I was able during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| rush hour traffic to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| it to them and go back to my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| faster than actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| using the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| Small tech businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| cannot exist here in Knoxville on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| speeds. It just can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| It's really interesting that the telecoms are so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| interested in intervening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Why is that? It's definitely not because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| they care for our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| They've proved that to me for the last 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| It's not that they're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| serve the underserved. Otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| they'd be out in Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| They've had decades to do that. They're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| protect their monopoly here and they're scared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| this KUB is going to give us much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| service at a much better price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| Their intervention here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| is really disheartening because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| in my business we don't try to legislate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| our competition out of existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| Instead we improve our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| We improve our pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| and everyone's better off for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| Today you've got two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| choices. You can please the corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| lobbyists and I know a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| have come into town and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| going to be speaking today. Kill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| the bill and watch innovative industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| move to areas with excellent symmetrical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| internet service or you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| represent the vast majority of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| constituents wishes. All those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| showed up here invest in ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| and start attracting great businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| in tech jobs to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| Make no mistake, there's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| be an effort to delay this bill today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| A vote to delay is a vote to kill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| the bill. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| everyone in this room knows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| there's no political cover for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Next person signed up to speak is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Mark Messer. Mr. Messer, could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| come to the podium and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| could start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| And you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6668)|
| 1:51:18| Hello. Thank you for having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| me. My name is Mark Messer. I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| resident of Lindaloo Way up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| in Oakwood Lincoln Park. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| love our neighbors there. Thank you Mr. Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| Thomas for being there. We're very proud of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| So I am also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| speaking here in support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| this effort. I'm a big believer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| in it. To give you some background, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| may or may not add veracity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| to my opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| I am a cyber security engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| I work for a Fortune| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| 250 DOD contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| remotely in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| I'm able to do that because fortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| I am able to get service. If I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| living in certain areas of Knoxville, I would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| be able to and I would have to move away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| And I love living here. I've lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| here for 20 some years. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| want to do that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| let's go over some base assumptions if we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| to some degree. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| internet requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| increase yearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| That's just a fact of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| Similarly, if you have more traffic on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| you're going to have to address that at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| It's a fact of life. We need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| fiber and fiber isn't free. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| will not be free no matter who is providing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| I would prefer to get it from people whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| kids are going to our schools, who live in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| who are from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| around here. They're investing in their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| This matters to people and we're not going to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| same sort of attitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| from companies where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| it's more or less worrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| about a business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| At this point, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| tend to take distributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| resources like the internet that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| critical to our nation's infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| and dole them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| to different private companies. We can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| look at ways in which we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| Look at our highway system, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| It is absolutely critical to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| we run as a country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| We should not be run as a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| and that's hopefully the point that a lot of us are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| If we think about something like that, look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| pipeline attack that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| just the threat of not having gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| to get around was this critical issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| To make a comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| and this is not at all to bag on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| AT&T, but look at what happened when AT&T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| went down around Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| in Nashville. Horrible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| horrible event. That is not to slam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| them, but that is an example of how critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| this infrastructure is to us. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| 911 calls weren't going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| I know several businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| their phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| systems, VOIP, were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| To some degree, we could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| it's just a technological necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| that we have this and an inevitability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| that this will be built out. We may as well do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| this on our own terms as an investment rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| an expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| Then I would like to talk about the economic considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| of this. People at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| previous meetings mentioned, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| I think this is a fair point, that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| were worried about having, I think the quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| was a quasi-governmental entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| overseeing this. I thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| was interesting, so I reached out to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| I spent about an hour and a half, maybe two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| hours just going over technical implementations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| with them. It was a fantastic conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| They were very, very forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| I have not yet heard back from other ISPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| which service our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| Another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| consideration is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| for employment, like I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| before, you've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| have internet. We're increasingly moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| to a distributed workforce, as you've heard already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| today. That's just a fact of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| Now, the most important thing, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| think, is the social implications of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| I did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| easily graduate from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| I did not easily graduate from college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| Both of those attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| took me longer than it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| have, and due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| to certain reasons, I was perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| disadvantaged at that, and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| realized, too, that I am very fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| compared to a lot of people. I always have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| been. Now, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| a lot of folks who have asymmetric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| disadvantage compared to a lot of other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| here, and I believe in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| vocation, that was the main focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| that we talked about. If that is true, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| is our main goal to being here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| it is critically important that we make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| that children are not stuck at home without internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| connectivity where they can't learn. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| the only reason why I am able to be here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| speaking about this. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| critically important that those who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| perhaps disabled and cannot easily get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| and communicate with folks. I mean, a lot of people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| been at home for a long time over COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| Those folks, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| myself, stayed sane because we could talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| to people over the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| When I was growing up, my father lived on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| other side of the country. I was able to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| him because of the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| These are all just profoundly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| important aspects of our civilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| and society today, and they will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| to be, and the requirements are only going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| to go up. We can get ahead of this on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| end and be a competitive city like Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| is, including with lessons learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| from their deployment. That was a major part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| discussion. There has been a lot of research going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| into this, and I think it stands up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| robust criticism and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| I welcome talking about this as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| as we can, but we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| sit on this. This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| We're all here today. We all made the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| effort to come out, so please just listen to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6980)|

| 1:56:30| Wesley Kirkland. Mr. Kirkland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| if you could please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| State your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| and address for the record, and you'll have up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| My name is Wesley Kirkland. First off, thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| for letting me come and speak and bypassing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| the three-person limit. I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| at 10,851 Napier Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| apartment 204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| A disclosure for me. I actually live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| outside of the KUV service area. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| unfortunately live on LCB's service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| area, and one thing that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| very well known to me, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| recently found out, is Big Cable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| already won their bid to kill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| municipal fiber there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| Within the next year or two, I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| plan to move to KUV's service area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| and I would love to be able to see this fiber here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| But on to my points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| Many of Tennessee's rural counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| actually have municipal fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Our larger counties, where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| majority of our population lives, doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| That just seems like a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| disparity for us as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| right now. When I can go out to Union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| County, as their mayor has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| gratefully shown us, and live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| their area that already has fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| But one story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| I wanted to tell, too, is part of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| job at my work, and my work's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| headquartered in Lenoir City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7062)|
