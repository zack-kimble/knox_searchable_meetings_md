| 0:00:52| Commissioner Smith, would you begin tonight's meeting with a devotional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=52)|
| 0:00:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Fellow commissioners, we live in troubled and difficult times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=61)|
| 0:01:05| We are constantly bombarded by doom and gloom 24 hours a day, and it would be easy to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| that nothing good is happening in the world today, but there is good happening all around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Acts of humanity, people helping people, God's work being done to help those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| I think we need to focus more on the good that is happening, and I encourage everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| to seek the comfort, peace, and hope that can be found in the Lord God Almighty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| Please bow your head and join me in a short prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| Heavenly Father, we ask for your guidance and wisdom to help make correct decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Lord, we ask for your blessing of protection for Knox County, our state, our nation, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=107)|
| 0:01:55| your world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Lord, we pray that your will will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you so much, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| Tonight we also have Commissioner Daley is going to be leading us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Before Commissioner Daley leads us in the pledge, I do want to give him a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| of extra time to tell a little bit about the history of the flag that he's got for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| Go ahead, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| Let me get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| This flag was flown on September the 11th, 2012 over Afghanistan by our Air National| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| Guard 134th Refueling Wing, and my nephew, Zachary Daley, is a boomer on this plane right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| And I am so proud of him and so proud of our military and our first responders, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| flag is special to me because it did fly over Afghanistan in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| So if you would, everyone, if you want to stand, I'll say the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=190)|
| 0:03:19| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| What we're going to do, I know we may have some folks who are tuning in tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| It might be your first time ever watching a county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| Who knows, you might be having an early dinner tonight and you're flipping through community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| television and you came across this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| But I do want to sort of lay out the land of how our commission meetings work and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| we are in our monthly cycle of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Every month, we have two county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| Usually on the third Monday of the month, we have what's considered a county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| workshop, and on the fourth Monday of the month, we have the formal Knox County Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| of Commissioners meeting, which is what this meeting is right here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| Last week during our work session, we did what I would describe as a first pass through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| the agenda, where we discussed many of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| We divided some items that were, frankly, dealt with and discussed last week, and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| items were carried forward to be worked on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| We also identified a number of items that were placed on the consent agenda for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| So what that means is there's going to be a couple of times in tonight's meeting where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| we will vote on a slate of items that we already have discussed, and vote and approve all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| them with one vote, and you'll hear the county clerk reading them into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| And it seems, if you've never seen it before, it's sometimes going to be hard to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| But what that means is items that were previously discussed, put on our consent agenda, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| all be voted at in one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| So that's kind of how things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| And later in this evening, after the main board of commissioners meeting, at approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| seven o'clock, we'll proceed to go into our zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| So if you're watching this meeting right now because you've got an interest in zoning or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| land use issue, that's going to be a separate leg of the meeting that will start at seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| If you're someone that's got an agenda item on the zoning, that's actually a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| Zoom meeting that you'll need to log into, and our IT department will assess that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| And then I'll look to all my fellow commissioners as our plan will be that we will log out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| this meeting, then log back in to start the zoning part of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| So I hope that's clear, the IT department, as they've all been very helpful to help make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| We're now at the part of the meeting where we'll set our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| I've got two couple of items that I want to clarify and add here at the top of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| Mayor Jacobs is going to provide an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| I know that you all probably saw the announcement and have read about the businesses that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| going to be reopening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| So I know Mayor Jacobs would like to talk to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| That's going to be on the top of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| That's going to be followed by Sheriff Tom Spangler with a similar update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| So those are two ads that we will jump into first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Then we'll move into the more formal agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| And just if you're writing this down, another item that we need to formally add, which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| then go on consent, is item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| The items that are going to be deferred are going to be items 16, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=387)|
| 0:06:46| 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Item 52 will be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| And the non-consent items for tonight's meeting are going to be items 1, 2, 3, 4, 38, 39,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=414)|
| 0:07:09| and all zoning items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| I also want to, here at the beginning of the meeting, be clear and state for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| that we are meeting electronically via Zoom streaming pursuant to Tennessee Governor Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| Lee's Executive Order No. 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| So that is the reason why we are meeting in this particular format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| So are there any changes to the agenda, polls, things the Chair recognizes Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=450)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| I may have missed it, but there was an item to be added about some hand sanitizers from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| Smoky Mountain Moonshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| And I'm not sure that's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Yeah, we do need, I thought I poured that on, but we do need to add the agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| to accept the delivery of the Smoky Mountain hand sanitizers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=475)|
| 0:08:03| Let's see if we can get that formally stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Thank you for catching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Because I got a call on it, and I may have even gotten an email and somehow didn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| that on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=493)|

| 0:08:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Triscilla, can you pull that item, if you've got a record of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| I did send it by email to all the Commissioners, and it's 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| Which item is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| It'll be Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| I can resend the email if you need me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| Okay, and that one I'm looking through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Is that one on the agenda that was put up to Agenda Quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| No, because it has to be formally added, and it was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| Okay, so we do need to also add that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| So that will be an additional add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Is there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Oh, yeah, Randy, you've still got your hand up or your light on, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=546)|

| 0:09:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=556)|

| 0:09:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| We need to formally add number 39 for this evening, a discussion item about County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=568)|

| 0:09:37| So that was 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| That was the discussion item that was added at the work session last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| It is on your agenda quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| Are there any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Seeing none, Commissioner Skinmaker, are you good to see your hand still up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Is there a motion for setting tonight's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| Commissioner Smith, a motion to approve agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=603)|

| 0:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| The first item on tonight's agenda, the chair recognizes Mayor Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| If you'd like to provide an update, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| We've been very fortunate here in Knox County and East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| We've been able to thus far avoid the brunt of COVID-19, and our numbers have been relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Two things I think that since we talked last Monday, one is the health department is continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| to do testing and expanding that as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| This past weekend, thanks to the City of Knoxville, we had a testing event at the Coliseum where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| they did over 500 tests, and they will be doing drive-through testing at Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| and Public Works, I believe, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| Getting test kits is still a challenge because there's such a demand nationwide, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| one of the restricting factors in what they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| But they are expanding it as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| They're doing a very good job, and Dr. Buchanan and our team have done a fantastic job throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Again, I'd like to thank IT for help in setting up the drive-through testing as well as Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| and Public Works for facilitating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| The other news, of course, is today we had a press conference where we announced the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| plan from City-County Joint Task Force for a phased reopening of businesses in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| That will go into effect on May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| The governor's order expires on April 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| He had changed some things, as you all probably know, with restaurants opening today and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| other things, so Dr. Buchanan had to reinstate her order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| On May 1st, we will see our restaurants open at 50% capacity with some other restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| as well as other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| There are benchmarks within the document as to how to proceed after that into Phase 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| and to Phase 3, each, of course, having less restrictions than the previous phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| I cannot reiterate enough that I think that a large part of the reason we've been successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| here in East Tennessee in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 is because people have accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| personal responsibility in their actions to keep their communities safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| That doesn't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| COVID-19 is still going to be with us for some time, so we all have to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| This, unfortunately, doesn't mean that things are returning back to normal probably anytime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| soon, but we are making strides in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| I appreciate the Health Department, the City of Knoxville, the Joint Task Force, and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| the businesses as well that had input into developing this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Does anyone have any follow-up questions for Mayor Jacobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| I'm going to see if I have a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| Gil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Commissioner Gil, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Commissioner Gil, if you could turn on your microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| I wanted to know if restaurants that are opening are going to have an opportunity to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| certification or a certificate saying that they have met some of the guidelines that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| the Health Department has set about, and how is that going to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| The Health Department is creating teams that businesses can call and will help them implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| and adhere to the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Yes, there is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I'm not exactly sure how that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| That would be a question for Dr. Buchanan, but there is a process to where they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| a certification showing that they are adhering to the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| And that's for all businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Thank you, Commissioner Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Did you have a follow-up to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Commissioner Gil, if you could tap your space bar or turn on your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| My follow-up question is, does the Health Department have the staffing capacity to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| certifications, or is it going to be staggered by business, whether it's a restaurant, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| it's a salon, whether it's any other intimate business that deals directly with the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| With the staffing, of course, that is going to be challenging, because like all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| departments, they don't have unlimited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| And again, those specific questions you'd have to direct towards Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| I know that they'll do the best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| And one of the unique aspects of this plan is that they do have these teams and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=977)|
| 0:16:27| potential certification, which was something that we came up with here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| I passed it on to the governor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| But we're really happy that that came out of the Joint Task Force, because at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| it's unique to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| The chair next recognizes Commissioner Daley, followed by Commissioner Jay after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Mr. Mayor, can you update a little bit on the medical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| I personally have missed three very important medical appointments, and I know where hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| are at less than 50 percent capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| So do you have any update on when our medical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| I doctor specialist, everybody will be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Yeah, Commissioner, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| My daughter is in the critical care field and she actually flew up to New Jersey yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| to work in a hospital because there there is so little work here currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| Last count, our hospitals here in Knox County, we're a little over 50 percent occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| We look at ICU beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Those at this point, again, those those are fine at this point and adequate for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| that we anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Ventilators, the ventilator counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Those are really fluid because ventilators can be moved wherever they need to across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| I believe in and this has become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| We've had we've had some outpatient surgery centers reach out to us because of the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| prohibition on elective surgeries by the governor's office and dental procedures as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| They just can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| I believe that the governor is going to lift the prohibition on some elective surgeries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| That's and this is what we're following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| That's that's going to be under the state guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Mr. Chairman, I think I've seen Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Is she there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| I'm not sure if Dr. B is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| I mean, she's probably with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| If you wanted to weigh in on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| No, I mean, can you not hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| For some reason, Zoom wants to call me Peggy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| And Zach didn't recognize Peggy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Me either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| So anyway, just answer your questions, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| We already regulate all the restaurants and food establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| So we have a process for regulating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| We are partnering with the city and county codes and other people to help us regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| the other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| And that's worked well so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| We've been doing that with them this whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| So we anticipate that to continue to work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| We're putting together guidance and have given out guidance this whole time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| all the businesses that are involved in changing their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| So we feel pretty comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| It's going to be busy, but our staff is up to the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Dr. Buchanan, it sounds like that follow up was based on Commissioner Gil's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| original question as well as Commissioner Daly's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I'm going to look to both Commissioner Daly and Gil to see if that's got your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Next, the chair recognizes Commissioner Jay, then Commissioner Smith after Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1204)|
| 0:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| This is a follow up for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| Regarding certifications, I just want to make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Restaurants that are reopening will need to have a certificate that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| they're following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| And that's going to be issued by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| There's some confusion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| There's no certificate to say they're going to be following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| We've sent them, communicated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| They're going to be following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| And then we'll be doing our normal spot checks that we do to inspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I think those resumed this week, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| in anticipation of restaurants opening across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| We've asked to resume our inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| So there will be technically no certificate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| A re-permitting process is not in place to allow them to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| So I just want to make sure we're clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| And just following up on commissioner Daly's question and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| Conversation with the mayor about medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| Places that I know there's several constituents have called me that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| places that were deemed non-essential because they were either elective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Processes or other, are those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| are those in this guideline that was released today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| I'm having a hard time finding out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| It's not in their separate guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| That's still under the governor's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| He's really, he's changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| He didn't change the date of that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| And that'll be updated by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| The reopening plan is primarily focused on businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| not on medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| They have their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Governing agencies and guidance that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| That comes from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| So most of what we're dealing with in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| in the plan is related to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| And Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| As well as the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| So that, that guidance is coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| And do you have any knowledge of when that guidance will be given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| And I mean, if there's orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1330)|

| 0:22:46| given it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| if there's orders through the first and they're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| we are on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Do you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| as they announced any kind of we'll give you more guidance on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Wednesday or Friday or excellent professional organizations have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| guidance on their websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Resource for our local American cops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| So I'm not sure we're going to reproduce that guidance because it's already out there and it's done by professional agencies or professional organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1382)|
| 0:23:11| So we're trying to put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| We've asked the Knoxville Academy of Medicine to act as a resource for providers to be able to provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| But again, the governor may put some guidance out for medical providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| He's I'm not exactly sure what he's going to put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| He said some things today. One of them was Jim's, but I don't remember the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| OK, thanks for Mr. J. Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was going to weigh in and then Dr. Buchanan's are already clarified this to Carson Daly's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1424)|
| 0:23:52| Medical practices are regulated and licensed by the state and they'll be issuing all the guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1432)|
| 0:24:00| I think I saw somewhere the other day and it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| I don't know where you get information from these days. Sometimes you get too much information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| But a four phased, a four phased approach to reopening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| And in there, I believe there was a guidance on medical practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1456)|
| 0:24:26| Very good. OK, are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| Mr. Smith, you're like still on. But are there any other follow up questions addressed to either Mayor Jacobs or Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1472)|
| 0:24:41| Mr. Chairman, I have one. Yes, Mr. Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| Mr. Gil, please push your space bar down again. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| My follow up question is for Dr. Buchanan. But first of all, I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| I really appreciate the number of county residents that came out Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| which served more than 500 people to take the COVID-19 tests in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| That was exemplary from our staff, especially our IT department and all of the health department professionals that were present on Saturday to efficiently issue that test to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1507)|
| 0:25:21| So I just need to, first of all, acknowledge that. And second, I need just a brief amount of information as it relates to our process for any future testing that will come forth for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1521)|
| 0:25:39| Or have we reached the end of what we're going to be doing regarding testing in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1539)|
| 0:25:50| Sure. Yeah. So most providers in Knox County are testing and we encourage folks to reach out to their doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| Walk-in clinics are also testing. We know that. So the private sector is doing testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| Obviously, if somebody goes to the hospital and needs emergency care, they're able to test as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| As far as what the health department is doing, we are testing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Right now, our schedules are going to be testing three days a week during the week in a drive-thru model that helps preserve PPE because we're going to have to change out everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1572)|
| 0:26:21| We don't like to change our gloves in between patients. It keeps us safe and keeps the patients safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| In that model, we're able, and it's an appointment model, and it helps us a little bit with scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| In that model, we're able to test 100 to 150 people a day, and we're tweaking that every day to see what we can max out and not run out of our supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| As the mayor mentioned, supplies continue to be a challenge for us, and we continue to look for options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| In addition to that, what my staff wants to do is map where the zip codes that people live in where we have tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1609)|
| 0:26:59| Then look at the map of cases and look at the map of where testing has happened and target our testing in areas where there's less access to testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1619)|
| 0:27:10| Using some data to decide where we're going to do testing if we do another surge-type event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| In addition to that, the state is asking public health possibly to do some more testing in our nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1636)|
| 0:27:24| As you know, nursing home residents are at very high risk for complications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| In other parts of the state, they've had some pretty significant outbreaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| We may be doing some focus testing in nursing homes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Again, trying to use some data so that we make the best use of our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| Go to areas where we haven't seen a lot of folks tested, which is why we decided to do 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| We looked at our map of where we tested people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| We hadn't tested anybody who lived there, even though, honestly, we're not that far from 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| We still haven't tested anybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| And so we went there and had a successful event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| So we're going to do the same kind of thing in thinking about future testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| We won't be doing any testing this weekend at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| Just going to take a step back and look at some data and make some data-driven decisions about where to test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1689)|
| 0:28:19| Commissioner Gill, would you – I'm sorry, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| Listen, I got – yes, I will just make sure that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| My follow-up question is, could someone speak to the reactions from the public regarding the decision to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| How – what businesses – what are some of their comments, and has it been positive or has it been tepid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| Has it been people are going to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Could someone speak to the reaction regarding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Mayor Jacobs or Dr. Bay, you may want to handle that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| I mean, the reaction has been mixed, and it depends on who you talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| Some people are ready to go, and other people are, as you said, tepid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| So, I mean, this is going to be a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| And, again, it's just almost what quarter or what sector of our community that you talk with have different concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1755)|
| 0:29:24| So it's hard to say what the overall reaction has been because it's varied very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| And I would echo that from the reports I get from my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| Some people – it's just a mixed bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Some people have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Some people are just ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| And some people are like, yeah, I'm not so sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| So, you know, I think it's up to individuals to make that decision about individual business owners and individuals themselves about do they gavel out, do they reopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1786)|
| 0:29:57| But it's also our guidelines are written to really help create a safe environment for people to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| If business owners and the public will both follow the guidelines, I believe we can maximize safety because they're based on how COVID-19 is transmitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1804)|
| 0:30:15| and therefore based on the evidence of what we know protects people and prevents disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| So I think business owners are going to be responsible, the ones who decide to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| The ones who wait might just wait and see how it goes for everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| All right. Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Chair recognizes Commissioner Biggs, and then we'll go to Commissioner Jatham-Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| My question is actually for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| So in all this, one of the questions that I've been asked by multiple constituents is where to go to for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| Where is the number threshold to where we start scaling back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Where, you know, phase one, we just kind of, it's obviously a gray area, something we've never been dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| But they want an opportunity to look at information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| What would be best for us as commissioners to give them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Is it the health department's website, the CDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Is it the state's website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| Because I've gotten a lot of positive feedback off of actually off of Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| He put up a post on Facebook, kind of like a hot zone map of the zip codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| And people really seem to like that demographic of, you know, being able to visually see something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| Just, you know, kind of direct me what you think we should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| So the first place I'd direct people is to our website, which is, I'm going to guess, where Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| got the map of where cases are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| It's not a hot zone map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| It's a map of where cases are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| And so that's the first place I'd look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| That's where most of the data is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| And, you know, we didn't just make this decision because we felt like doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| We basically made this decision because our case count has been pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Not the count itself, but the increase in cases has been pretty flat for a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| Our hospitals are well prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| We've built up our capacity and tested our model, and we know it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| We've got more testing supplies and more testing is being done throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| So we saw some positive results from what we've been doing and felt like it was time to make the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| We will use similar benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Those benchmarks are talked about in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| We're looking at testing capacity, case increase, hospital capacity, our capacity to do contact tracing, and also deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1952)|
| 0:32:44| We'll be looking at deaths as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| And so all of those things give us a picture of how things are going in Knox County and what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| And within the context of what it really looks like, do we have a whole bunch of cases because we have an outbreak at a facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Or do we just have a whole bunch of cases spread across the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| That's something very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Not one number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| That data will be available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| Knox County IT has been fabulous to work with and changes and helps to change our website so that the public can have that information to be able to see how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=1995)|
| 0:33:27| Can you just that website real quick, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| It's a great question, Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| I'll have to find it and give it to you because it's a COVID something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Yeah, there's a link to it just on the front page of KnoxCounty.org right dead in the center of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Thanks, Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Any follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Next, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| And then now Commissioner Smith has turned his light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| So back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| If I could just get some clarification from Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| And I've had several constituents reach out that are they're very confused on the group size parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2049)|
| 0:34:18| They look at the guidelines and they look at you can go to Lowe's and go to Costco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| You can go to any number of places that people may be spaced apart, but collectively under one roof in one space that definitely could be over 100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2062)|
| 0:34:33| They look at guidelines for churches that say, yes, come in socially distanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| But, again, in one space, well over 100 people can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| But then you look at the sort of avoid or don't have any events that have more than 10 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| And it really I mean it knocks out first off it knocks out a huge industry, which is the event industry, which could be anywhere from caterers to tent suppliers to wedding venues to whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2088)|
| 0:34:58| But even you couldn't even have a wedding outside, even if you social distance in a large group, according to the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| So I guess just some clarification on the group size, because the guidelines I know have to be set in a certain way to sort of put some real parameters around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2104)|
| 0:35:15| But it seems counterintuitive when there's a line at the door at Costco in the morning and you can't hold an event somewhere else and even an outdoor space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2115)|
| 0:35:25| Well, I think that the difference comes in the purpose of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Wedding in line at Costco is not a social event, usually, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| So people aren't hugging and kissing and shaking hands where a wedding or a fundraiser or other things like that are much more of a social event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2133)|
| 0:35:42| The reason we closed, we don't we're not going to let people stand at the bar in a restaurant is that's meant for congregating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2142)|
| 0:35:50| It's meant for coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| I think we're going to have to pay attention to cases from places like churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| You know, it's a bit of a challenge with allowing churches to open, but we felt like that was something our community needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2159)|
| 0:36:09| We felt like the churches were willing to follow those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| And, you know, so again, part of it comes down to the purpose of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| And most event venues are around congregating and getting together and sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| You know, it's usually a buffet and there's lots of sharing happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| Could somebody hold an event and say, here, we're going to hold an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| It's going to maybe be a music event for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| And we're going to we're going to do social distancing and we're going to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| We're all going to sit six feet apart on the lawn and watch, you know, watch a concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| Why would that be any different than a church service or another type of event that is being allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| That's a great question. And, you know, these are these guidelines are written based on CDC guidance and honestly also for guidance from Johns Hopkins on recommendations for how to maintain social distancing and reduce risk in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2219)|
| 0:37:19| I think I'm OK. I understand it. I just I really think that we ought to look at all of the different similar types of events that some are being allowed and some are not, because we still have a tremendous amount of businesses that are are really incredibly limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2239)|
| 0:37:33| I get it. I understand it. But if we're going to do for one, we ought to match and do that for the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| And I think that there ought to be a way for people to to to sort of say, you know, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| But could we do something that's similar? So I just I want to point that out, especially for the event industry, which is, you know, more than ever going to it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2265)|
| 0:37:54| I mean, by these guidelines, nobody should even remotely think about getting together for any kind of event whatsoever till August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2274)|
| 0:38:03| And that's that goes from hurting to devastating in a lot of capacities of our business industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| Yeah, these these guidelines are not easy to write. We have to think about all that. And we're very aware of those challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2290)|
| 0:38:20| We're also very aware of the public health risk and the disease risk and the reality of covid-19. So trying to balance all of that was a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2300)|
| 0:38:30| We certainly are open to reconsidering, but we can't reconsider every guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2310)|
| 0:38:39| We have to at some point just make make decisions and move forward. And, you know, I'm compassionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| I'm understanding of the challenges. And again, the guidelines are very challenging to write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2327)|
| 0:38:56| There's no playbook for this. Thank you. I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| I've heard from a lot of folks as well. Commissioner J. I'm not seeing any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| So I think that should wrap up the questions for both Dr. Buchanan and Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| I'm sorry, Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith, your light just came on. Your microphone is off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Well, I just found the four phase document and apparently it is some more Facebook Internet fake news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2361)|
| 0:39:33| Dr. Buchanan, do you know, has the state said when we'll be able to go see our primary care physician?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| When we'll be able to go see our urologist? When we'll be able to get back to seeing our our doctors that provide the daily health and screen us for diseases other than COVID-19 that we may have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2380)|
| 0:39:56| Honestly, the ability to go see your doctor never stopped. That was a decision made by your doctor, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| It was only elective surgeries and like mammograms and stuff that they got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| And again, some of that was even a decision made by the provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| Primary care offices have been open and seeing patients. I don't know about the urologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| I don't know about the particular practice, but doctors have a lot of autonomy in what they decided to do or not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| And they may have decided that they weren't going to do those things for lots of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| But those those practices have actually been open, but they may have been limiting their exposures and limiting their patient's exposures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| I know my father sees a gerontologist. They were not seeing patients because of the age of the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| So different practices make different choices. That was not an order from the government, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2443)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you, Dr. B. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| All right. Thank you. One final question to Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah. Quick question. And I probably could guess what it'll be that we don't know because it's in that gray area like we were talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2461)|
| 0:41:10| But phase three, July, August area, would that be when people can start looking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| The reason I'm asking, because I've had a lot of questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| We can start talking about graduating our seniors or graduation ceremony or that would obviously be up to schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| But your input would definitely be needed for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| Well, that's a great question. I guess what I want to remind everybody is that phase one is at least 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2490)|
| 0:41:39| Depending on all of those data points we talked about earlier, phase one could last longer than 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| And then phase two would be the same way. We have to wait and see what disease rates, what is happening with disease rates and capacity and deaths and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2506)|
| 0:41:57| So I don't really want to make any predictions on what the summer is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| Because I just don't we don't know how reopening is going to go. Reopening might be totally fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| We get a little blip in cases and we kind of go back to where we are now with just kind of the same number of new cases every day with very little variation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2529)|
| 0:42:18| And that'd be great if we did that. Hospitalization stayed low. Death rates stayed low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| All of that kind of stuff. Then we'd move on to phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| If we skyrocket in cases and our hospital capacity gets wiped out, we won't be able to go on to phase two because we've moved too quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2549)|
| 0:42:40| I know everybody hates that uncertainty. Everybody wants me to be able to say, yeah, sure, we'll be able to move on to the next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| But the reality is that it's very dependent on what our community chooses to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| And whether our community chooses to continue to observe the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| And that's the business side and the public side observe the guidelines that are as they're written based on how disease is transmitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2579)|
| 0:43:08| And they've been doing that. And I trust they're going to keep doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| And I know Mayor Jacobs has said the same thing. We've been doing that. We trust that people are going to keep doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| And, you know, we talk, you guys ask questions about regulation. We regulate a lot of we regulate all the restaurants, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| And it's really we really push it as a partnership, educate them and help them make the right choices to be able to serve their their patrons safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2607)|
| 0:43:38| All right. Thank you, Dr. Buchanan. And the chair recognizes Mayor Jacobs for another insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2618)|
| 0:43:49| Yeah, thank you, Chairman. I'm actually in the chat box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| I'm typing the website address that the county has dedicated for the health department and COVID-19 information and statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2632)|
| 0:44:03| And also, you know, any plan or any time the government comes up with a plan, there's going to be issues with it because it's generally a one size fits all policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| But I will tell you that the joint task force did work hard to be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| There was a lot of input from different businesses. In fact, businesses, in some cases, were the ones that actually offered the guidance because it's stuff that they know that they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2657)|
| 0:44:32| And it could be affected that. So as much as possible, Dr. Buchanan and the joint task force did try to be as business friendly as possible through all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2672)|
| 0:44:45| It's not going to be perfect. It never is. But they did make a tremendous effort to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| All right. Thank you, Mayor Jacobs. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Moving on to our on our agenda, the chair now recognizes Sheriff Tom Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| Sheriff Spangler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Thank you, commission, for giving me a few minutes just to give you an update on our what we've been doing with the North County Sheriff's Office as far as our patrol entering calls and with our corrections division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2702)|
| 0:45:16| So first off, let me say I want to say very much how much I appreciate the men and women of the North County Sheriff's Office for the job they've been doing during this pandemic and making sure that not only we continue the services that I think that our citizens out here demand and deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2716)|
| 0:45:36| And I want to make sure that that I commend them for the job that they're doing, being out there on the front line, not only the men and women that are out there on patrol, but also our men and women working within our corrections facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2736)|
| 0:45:50| With that being said, just to give you a few updates. And before I move on, let me also say I want to say thank you to Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2750)|
| 0:45:58| She has been nothing but right there on the spot with us. Anytime we call, she's calling us back. She's answering her and her staff have been phenomenal with our corrections division and making sure that we've gotten everything that we're supposed to and that we're doing what they recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2758)|
| 0:46:17| And also we're doing things that that even I think may have surprised a lot of other people and how well they've been doing things. So with that, Dr. Buchanan, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2777)|
| 0:46:29| Since March 15, we have I shouldn't say we are courts and commissioners or judicial commissioners have released 537 inmates out of our corrections facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2789)|
| 0:46:47| We have never been at a point to where we are today. Today, our facility has 637 and I'm talking about our Roger D. Wilson detention facility. We have 637 people in that facility, which is down 400 inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2807)|
| 0:47:03| That dispels some of the fake news that is out there that we're not letting or that we're holding inmates and they're not having an opportunity to either be released on their own recognizances or whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2823)|
| 0:47:18| We've got some so called people out there that think they know what's going on within our facility. And this is why I want to get in front of you all to let you know what really is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2838)|
| 0:47:28| Not only that, but right now, currently, we have 1660 individuals that are on our pretrial release program. That's active people that are being watched right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2848)|
| 0:47:39| So we've got a lot going on just not only within the corrections side, but also with our pretrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| To give you a little bit of insight, when somebody is arrested and they're brought into our facility, there's a process that they go through. And that process is to make sure that they are tested, or when I say tested, that they are evaluated and also isolated for 14 days if they're within our facility for that long to make sure that if they do have the virus that we're following the CDC and the recommendation of Dr. Buchanan's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2868)|
| 0:48:16| So we want to make sure that not only are our employees are taken care of, but we're also taking care of those inmates that come within our facility. As of today, we have had zero inmates with COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2896)|
| 0:48:31| I knock on wood because I probably say that and I may end up running that as we go. But I want to make sure that because of the assistance from Dr. Buchanan's office and the resilience of our employees of going through everything that they should and our pandemic process that we have within our facility, that things are going very well. And I'm very thankful for that. And I would be remiss if I didn't say that I appreciate the job that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2911)|
| 0:49:02| Some of the things that I want to dispel that are going on out there, there are people out here that think that they know what's going on and they want to complain about what's going on within our facility. And some of the things is that, as I mentioned to you earlier about our facility at the Roger D. Wilson, that facility when it was originally built had 633 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2942)|
| 0:49:26| Today, we have 637 people at that facility. And what that means is we have two or three of our, or I'm sorry, that we have two buildings out there, two pods that are empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2966)|
| 0:49:43| So we have the capability, if we do have something happen, we have the capability of isolating people to where we need to have them. And so you as commissioners, I think would be very proud of the men and women, the way that they have worked to make sure that we're taking care of our citizens and those who are out here committing crimes that probably they shouldn't be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=2983)|
| 0:50:08| But some of the misinformation that has gotten out, there's an allegation that the jail is overcrowded. And as I mentioned to you, it is not. Another allegation is out there that two or three cells, allegation that there are two or three cells out there that are overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3008)|
| 0:50:25| And just so you know, all of our cells right now are single occupancy, which is something that hasn't happened in many, many years. We've been, we've heard that there's no hand sanitizer that's out there. That's also a false rumor that's going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3025)|
| 0:50:44| And to give you an idea of how much cleaning that has been going on within our facility out there at Roger D. Wilson and our facility here at the city county building and our work release center, they put in over 2,500 hours of cleaning that's been logged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3044)|
| 0:51:00| So every time somebody is moving, there's cleaning going on. So that's something that we make sure that we continue to do. The allegation that there's a shortage of medical staff at our Roger D. Wilson facility, it kind of perturbs me to the fact to know that people think that those things are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3060)|
| 0:51:22| And I guess it's because somebody makes that allegation that has to make it true. But within that facility, I think everyone knows that we have a contracted physician out there. Also a psychologist, a part-time dentist and full-time dentist assistant, full-time x-ray tech, a pharmacy supervisor, medical or non-medical techs and 13 LPNs and seven RNs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3082)|
| 0:51:44| We have a miniature emergency room within that facility. So it's, I think to say that we're not taking care of inmates is, well, I think you know where I'm going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3104)|
| 0:51:59| There's an allegation in Noss County Jail in any way can be compared to jails in Iran or China. That's absurd, as absurd on its face as can be. And, you know, for people to print things like that, to think that that's what's going on here. Yeah, I get a little aggravated about it because, you know, the men and women out there are working very hard. And I think it's very important that we stand up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3119)|
| 0:52:23| We screen not only, as I said, with our inmates, we're also screening our employees, our vendors, any official vendors that come into the lobby and the loading dock. So it's not just something that's haphazard. We're taking very serious of what we're to do. All of our screening, all the arrestees and the Sally port so it doesn't get into the facility before we ever do anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3143)|
| 0:52:50| There's many other things that go on and I'm not going to bore you with it, but I wanted to make sure that also some of the things that are going on is that we now have video arraignments with our courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3170)|
| 0:53:01| So, that's taken up a lot of time to keep us from transporting our inmates back and forth. So, hopefully, that's something that will continue on. Obviously, it's going to save Knox County money as far as transportation. And hopefully, we'll look for that to happen a little bit more down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3181)|
| 0:53:18| As I said, I wanted to make sure that you all know at least what we're doing out here. We have put extra men and women out on the streets, making sure that we stay in our subdivisions. Those people who are working in our schools, we've got them out answering calls and also making sure that we saturate Knox County with visibility and letting people know that we're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3198)|
| 0:53:44| Not to be enforcing anything as far as the COVID-19, but if they need something, we're there. And those men and women that are out there on patrol, that's what they're doing. We have been on, let me take that back, they have been on the front line and making sure that when somebody calls, we go there and we're not going to back away because of the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3224)|
| 0:54:06| We are taking our precautions. And I think the men and women have done an excellent job of that. So, with that being said, again, let me say thank you to those men and women in the Knox County Sheriff's Office. I appreciate their hard work and Dr. Buchanan and her staff for working with us very diligently and side-by-side. So, Dr. Buchanan, again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3246)|
| 0:54:29| All right. Thank you. I'd also like to recognize Dr. Buchanan to make a follow-up after Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| Sure. Thank you. Thanks, Commissioner. Yeah, I want to commend Sheriff Spangler's staff on the job that they're doing and to ensure that their staff are safe, the inmates are safe out at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3276)|
| 0:54:56| They work really closely with my staff to ensure that. And I feel very comfortable with the protocols they have and the way they're handling all of that. And they've also been very responsive when we've had a few issues with folks who didn't want to follow guidelines and stay in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3296)|
| 0:55:17| Okay. Thank you, Dr. Buchanan. Does anybody else have a follow-up for Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| Okay. All right. Seeing none, we will now move forward with the rest of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| I think Vice Chair Carringer had a question. I saw her raise her hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| Okay. I'm sorry. I was looking at the participant box to see if anybody clicked on that little blue thing there. So, go ahead, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you, Chairman. Sorry about that. Mine's somehow not popping up. I just wanted to make a couple of comments. One, I wanted to thank our health department and the whole staff for what they've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3345)|
| 0:55:59| And also kind of a couple of questions that Commissioner Daley and Commissioner Smith brought up about physician offices and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3359)|
| 0:56:08| As far as I know, all of them that I know have been working the entire time, and a lot of them are doing the tele-med.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3368)|
| 0:56:17| So, you may check with your physicians to see if they're doing the tele-med. But that is a big ongoing thing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| And then the other thing was just to say thank you to all of the sheriff officers and our city officers, all those first line responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3384)|
| 0:56:35| Thank you all for being there and putting yourselves in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| And I truly appreciate all that all of y'all are doing to all of Knox County and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3399)|
| 0:56:46| I think both mayors have worked very well with each other, and it really shows on the TV and in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| So, thank you to all of you all. This is something new for all of us. None of us have ever experienced this in any field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3412)|
| 0:57:03| So, it's not over, and we're going to have to all remain a little more patient and do the best we can to support each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3423)|
| 0:57:15| So that we don't have any, nobody really knows why we've kind of been sort of flat in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| And maybe it is because we have followed such great, you know, the rules and trying to stay away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| So, anyway, I just wanted to thank everybody that's been involved in that day-to-day process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| I know it's not been easy, but thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Thank you all. Thank you. May Knox County look very well in these times of difficult decision-making and circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3456)|
| 0:57:48| All right. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| All right. Next, as we work through, I believe we've got drives and roads as our next agenda item, but I'll look to the clerk's office to call them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3471)|
| 0:58:00| I'm sorry, Commissioner Nystrom, can we approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| Oh, that's right. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm jumping ahead. Forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| All right. We do need to get our minutes approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| So, could the chair will entertain a motion for approval of the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Okay. That was Commissioner Daley with the motion, and the second, just raise your hand, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| So, first by Daley, second by Beeler. Madam Clerk, would you please call a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Commissioner Smith votes aye. Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Commissioner Nystrom votes aye. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye. Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| Commissioner Anders votes aye. Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=3528)|

| 1:18:10| Chairman, do you, and if not then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| I think it'd be really nice if we could do maybe like a proclamation for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| since they donated that during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| I think that'd be really nice of us if we could do that. If not, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| Well, I know. We'll put that, you know, hopefully as we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| get to the other side of this, there'll be an opportunity also to honor a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| folks like that, but I'll have Drusilla kind of put that on the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| and we'll work through that because I think it's awesome. It's very helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| so I agree with you, Commissioner Biggs. All right, everyone voted in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4718)|

| 1:18:50| Ms. Ellis. The next item is number 38. Discussion item regarding problems with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4730)|
| 1:18:58| TDS and Comcast providing service to customers. All right, thank you. This was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| brought to our attention by Commissioner Bussler, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| Commissioner Bussler, Chair, recognizes you to open this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair. When you, we always have a problem where it's either like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| 9-11 or we have flooding comes in, some things pop up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| that maybe we should have handled before the situation brings it to light to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| We've been talking about getting service throughout the county for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| internet service and things of that sort. We've had a problem with a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| these companies that are unable to get it to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| customer, which is very, which they, these customers have the internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| service all the way around them, so like Comcast is on all four sides of this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| customer, and I know they're a little bit farther off the road, but there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| pole that was close to this one customer that was with 150 feet of this customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| but under their guidelines, they had to go from the road 787 feet to get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| services, which costs about $3,000 for them to run that for that customer, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| there's a pole right, again, 150 feet that's in this next subdivision that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| could have, you know, piggybacked off of. There's some instances for TVX, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4822)|
| 1:20:30| the runaround that I got from these companies for these different companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| this is, this is one example, was unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| When I talked to them in Nashville, it was, first of all, they sent me an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| back, talked about that they had to install four poles for this one customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| then I go out and take a look at it and see where these things are at and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| why can't you do this on the poles that are already stuck up there that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| customer put installed, and then they said we were, we were sorry about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| Mr. Busser, we meant to say Piles, P-I-L-E-S. I don't know what that is, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| couldn't explain to me what that is. If we're going to get franchises in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| county to where we can get internet to people like that, we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| hold them accountable to get it to everybody if they've got service close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| to these people. The other thing that we have, too, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| right above us in Campbell County, we had a thing called K-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| which was a virtual school like what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| With schools, what we're doing right now, we could have had school continue on if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| we had that service in Knox County, but we've kind of let that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| slide. So let's look at this in the future. Let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| look at K-12 to where we can have continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| schools do some of these internet services like K-12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| and get with the people in Campbell County how they do it for the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| state of Tennessee out of Campbell County. Make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| the people, when they need internet service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| that they can get internet service without being charged an arm or a leg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| and there's more examples than just that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| But once this slows down a little bit and we get back together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| we need to have some people look in to how we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| this service throughout our county that will also help our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| when they're out in sickness that we can continue schooling on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| And K-12 is a good example of what we can do just like what we're doing under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| Zoom here. And that's what I wanted to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| I don't need, you know, anything to be discussed about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| We just need to have a committee to sit up and say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| how can we do this from this point on out? If we ever run into this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| again, how can we take care of schools? And the last thing I want to say, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| this is kind of to Mr. Smith, I asked him a question about the hand sanitizer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| and he could not answer me where it was internal or external.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| I don't want to blame him online for that. So anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| thank you all for listening to me, but we do need to take care of these problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| where we have continuing schools even when they're out because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| sickness. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| All right. Thank you. Thank you so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Commissioner Bussler. And I'll kind of make a clarifying statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| You know, he's brought to us really two issues. One is internet access. Another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| is a different way to deliver educational stuff. I know at the start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| of this crisis, that was a major concern and will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| continue to be moving forward. I want to reckon I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Biggs, whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| lights are on, in order when Commissioner Jay's came on first and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| then Commissioner Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This seems to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| be a perfect topic for the Cable TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Committee. Is there, I think Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| Buehler, don't you chair that? I didn't know if there was any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| meeting or update or anything you had to add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| or if that's something I'll meet maybe this summer or virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| Go ahead, Mr. Buehler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, I was thinking the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| thing. I think it would be a perfect time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| convene a meeting of the Cable TV Committee. I'll get with Driscilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| and check the meeting schedule and we'll convene the Cable TV Committee. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| some internet is provided by cellular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5049)|

| 1:24:16| Cable TV issues. I've tried to handle those by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| individuals and so far every individual that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| dealt with personally, I think Comcast has accommodated, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| this still is a larger discussion I think we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| The chair agrees with you and it's interesting that Cable TV Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| you know, sometimes we joke it's one of those committees that sometimes doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| do that much, but at a time like this, this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| perfect opportunity to use that as a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| leverage and make it a much more active committee because we've seen where we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| got a major issue with just trying to push out educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| resources to get throughout the whole county and that might be a more of a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| macro issue, not just for talking after this crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| as on we're getting on the other side of it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| for years to come that's going to be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Moving ahead, the chair next recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Commissioner Biggs. Thank you, Chairman. Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| stole the words right out of my mouth. That's exactly what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| Thank you both. Great minds think alike. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've had a few issues with Comcast and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| unfortunately we lost Katie Brown. She left Comcast about a year ago and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| a lady I've been speaking to, Kim Hayden in Nashville, maybe Charlie, I'd say he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5131)|

| 1:25:40| for Miss Brown who was awesome. You could call her and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| everything got taken care of. So if y'all need anything, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| lady's contact now that I know of is Kim Hayden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| and I can text you her number if you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| Thank you, Commissioner Daley. If you could get that sent out to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| that'd be helpful. I still kind of miss Russell Bird a lot too. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| know, it seems like he was the face of Comcast for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| So I think, Commissioner Daley, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| All right, you're good. All right, Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| next item please. It's item 39, discussion item regarding County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| Government Month. All right, very good. The Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| recognizes Commissioner Skinmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The National| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| Association of Counties established County Government Month in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| 1991, and the whole idea was to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| counties to raise public awareness of the roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| counties play in our communities, as obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| with what's been going on lately. And of course, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| established a theme for this year's County Government Month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| that counties matter, and I think that's a very true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| And of course, counties operate over 1,900 public health departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5218)|
| 1:27:05| and Commissioner Carringer in just a minute will give us a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| information about that. But counties are actually one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| USA's oldest forms of government, dating back to 1634,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| and today there's actually 3,069 county governments in the United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| States. And public officials like ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| and the mayors and the elected constitutional officers, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| actually 37,984| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| county officials in the United States, which is a pretty amazing number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| Kind of some interesting facts that counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| own and maintain 46 percent of America's road miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| and counties actually own 38 percent of the bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| in the United States. Counties are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| in 78 percent of the public transportation services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| and another interesting fact is that counties operate 91 percent of our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| jails. And nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| there's actually 3.6 million county employees, and of course our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| Knox County employees have done an absolutely fantastic job during this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| pandemic. And counties are privileged to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| 314 million citizens in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| And I think, and I did want to also mention that I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| Commissioner Gill bringing this to our attention, kind of with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| everything that has been going on, we kind of overlooked it. But I think at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| this point, Michelle Carringer, Commissioner Carringer, may want to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| some things about our public health system in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| and what a great job they've done. Okay, thank you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| Schoonmaker. Yes, as John mentioned about all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| Knox County Health Departments and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| different counties, Knox County falls under like the big four, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| would be Shelby County, Chattanooga, and Knox County, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| Nashville. We have our own health departments that are ran by our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| county, where all the other counties fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| under the state. So I guess one example would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| when Governor Lee kind of, when he releases the order the end of April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| as far as businesses and whether to go back and all, we have our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| own health department here in Knox County that will give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| the guidelines in terms of not having to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| along with all of them that go from the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| that we have our own. And therefore, I think we're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| fortunate that Knox County has their own because we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| pretty much anything that you would need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| about your health or keeping safe in Knox County is right there with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| health departments, and we have several locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| Of course, everybody knowing that the main one is over off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| Central Avenue. So what makes ours so unique is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| they are every day studying about what's happening in Knox County as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| as what diseases or viruses and all that may be going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| So they are used to studying our area. So that's why I feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| you know, so far that we've been very fortunate that we've been able to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| that upper hand on COVID-19 because of all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| that has been going on in our health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| So, you know, I think most everybody in Knox County can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| feel confident in knowing that our health department does have the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| interest of all those in Knox County in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| keeping us all healthy and staying safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5472)|
| 1:31:20| All right. Thank you. I'm going to chair. Commissioner Gill, you were actually one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| of the first folks who brought this to our attention last week, but we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| have something on the agenda. Would you like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair. This was my statement, and I guess we can have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| part of the resolution, that our county support and maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| public infrastructure, transportation, and economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| assets. We keep residents healthy, ensure public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| safety to protect our citizens, maintain public information, and coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| our elections. We implement a broad array of federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| state, and local programs in a cost-effective manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| And I just simply want to salute and say good job to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| Thank you. Very well done. Yeah, it's well done and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| really for so many of our frontline folks that are out there doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| all the hard work, you know, sometimes we get a lot of press coverage, but really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| we all know that it's, one could argue where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| you know, we can get the bills paid, but there's a lot of other folks doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| really important work. And frankly, this is the kind of thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| we normally would have passed an honorary resolution on it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| I told Commissioner Schoonmaker, I said, you know, I do want to be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| because over the last two months, we've had a lot of honorary resolutions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| have come before us. And I've said, you know what, I've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| let's try to postpone those till we get back together face-to-face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| And frankly, I wanted to be consistent and not just pass one to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| ourselves. So as we get through this and get back together face-to-face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| perhaps even, it doesn't have to be County Commission Month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| as proclaimed by NACo, we can always, you know, pass something to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| honor and recognize so many of our other frontline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| folks when we get to that time. So I believe, Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5580)|
| 1:33:08| I see Chair recognizes Commissioner Smith. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| Mr. Chair, to be perfectly consistent, you need to give us one of your pun jokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5592)|
| 1:33:21| You know what, I'm saving it up for a whole bunch of them before my last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| meeting and I'll probably make it an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| So it will be torturous for all of you. Although I will say I posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-business?start=5606)|
