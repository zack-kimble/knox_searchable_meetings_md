| 0:01:11| seven day church of God relative to this establishment. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| defer to vice mayor Becker since this is in his district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| to make a motion to. To make a motion regarding this thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| you. I was going to ask I'm sorry. Mr chairman. Yeah I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=84)|
| 0:01:31| sorry. I was actually going to use Mr Swanson to explain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=91)|
| 0:01:38| law in this case will briefly. This is a. On premises permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| so there's a requirement that they be three hundred feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| From church school. Other. Applicable things and it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| suggest in this file that. There's 68 feet from the closest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| church. And the only exception to that is of course when an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| establishment has. A liquor by the drink. Permit issued by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| state. So. I'm not aware of them having a. Liquor by the drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| permit. And let me ask Mr Swanson are we. This board tends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| to be very much a you know we can only decide certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| things. Are we allowed to give them a permit if they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| within that distance or are we not allowed. I suppose to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| supposed to okay. Fair enough. Do you. If they ever had. A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| beer permit. Not previously not not this individual but at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| location is no no. And let me yes I know you'd like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| something. Yes and there was a time out Delhi and they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| selling beer. Before before me. Were they drinking where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| drink it's it's been. A few years there's been a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| Problem with that if it's more than six months. Then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| preexisting nonconforming status would be lost. After six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| months. OK. The pastor of seven day event this church came to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| my location and willing to give a letter. That will allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| to. I'm afraid that won't help you. But anyway. Another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| is I've already applied for my. Wine license. So. That would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| matter. So you have applied to the state. Yes sir. What we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| always have an interesting dance here of how long do you how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| long did they tell you would be to you'd have your your liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| license. Two to three weeks. And it's interesting they always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| say two to three weeks but it ends up being almost a year so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| Is that right. It's funny how that works. Traditionally we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| have always postponed people who have. Been getting liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| license I don't necessarily like doing it that way but since we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| have we should probably continue so I will make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| postpone. To the. Until he. Receives his. Well is that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| that a possibility to say Mr Swanson to say we will postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| until such time as he comes in with a liquor license. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| a motion or do we have to. That's a motion to postpone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| an indefinite time and that's not right. All right. Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| just postpone for one month in the you know the sense that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| state might come around actually do something quickly. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| I would expect if you don't have one at the next meeting you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| you're in my district so you should get just give me a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| and we can postpone it again then if and just wait until you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| get your your liquor license so I'll make that motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| postpone one. Till the next regular beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| It's July the 28th. I second that motion. Yeah I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| gonna say or we could postpone it for three. Beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| meetings away and if he receives it to come to the. The office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| and just show the permit and then in which case we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| bring it before the beer board. I mean that's kind of where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| ended up with the hill. I mean that is that that is a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| I mean truly we don't want to have to go through it every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| time. It seems like we all get kind of frustrated with seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| it over and over so. Miss Martin. By the same token you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| can postpone it to whichever date you wish and if he'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| communicate with us we'll know. What to advise you at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| meeting. I have a second yet. I did that I can withdraw it if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=330)|
| 0:05:39| you want me to. It seems like I actually prefer your way and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| guess. Miss Martin what you're saying is that we postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| and you would just let us know he's not been with a liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| license so we would. Seems is going to work out the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| and I. Except he asked we've got a motion to postpone it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| July twenty eighth meeting. But it is now. The part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=361)|

| 0:08:09| program is important enough that I don't. Want that just to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=489)|

| 0:08:49| it. Chairman how our information indicates that. The owner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=529)|
| 0:09:00| this business has not been in for processing. So I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| to. I realize this is in Mississippi less district so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| I'd like to suggest postponing this to the next regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| scheduled meeting of the rear board in July. If that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=552)|

| 0:09:31| with the manager. They didn't understand they should be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=571)|

| 0:09:59| I question did you have we had that country and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| weeks before us previously yes that was my recollection I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| beginning to think that they. Are making a different decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| on whether they are going to. That's so unusual for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| because. It's more than one location I was just curious I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| want to be sure I was correct about that. Thank you. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=621)|

| 0:10:27| They're on little eighty eight oh four Neville Lane Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| three seven nine two three. Officer has no record. Of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| complete. Make to approve. Councilman. Mr. Hall we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| distance problem with this business and although there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| a pre-existing location I believe it's been out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| business for months. Rico. And I would defer to Mr. Swanson on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| this. I believe it's the same situation that we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| earlier. It indicates on our information that the prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| business closed out in a six. And there is a school within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| two hundred and fourteen feet of this location. If it closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| out in oh six then and there's no been no beer permit since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| then there would be not be a pre-existing nonconforming basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| that would not be a correct day. Mr. Little can speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| that and with that's where mangoes is located I realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| within a year I believe they've I've not been a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| paragraphs been down town for just maybe a year. Maybe what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| was pulled. Miss Day was the records for mango but but look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| at the first year ago didn't serve. It was a BYO place when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| it was there. I may go back to mango in which case I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| have a slight problem presently before us. Considering wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| bars in the title of the name of the business I suspect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| y'all are applying for a wine liquor permit liquor by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| drink that's correct. Any idea when that will be. I get my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| final inspection tomorrow and it's been in process for about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| month now. So that should not be long. So you've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| applied. Yes ma'am. And we're hoping to be open July 7th is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| the opening day. I had been told it was imminent. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you. Mr. Hall. Is there a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=743)|
| 0:12:32| I cannot support that given the current situation. So is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| Miss Pila. Would you would you like to make a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| motion or not. Is the is the motion to approve subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| final documentation. Also the documentation relative to a ABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| permit. It can be. I'm sorry. I can I can amend it to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| that motion. That's the motion. Is there a possibility of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| special beer board. I may change that. I did. I'll second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| that. I think under the circumstances we have a choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| and I think little is aware that that's critical to his opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| and the success there with his business. I know Mr. Little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| because of his previous manager at Foxton Country Club for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| number of years very successfully. He owns season's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| restaurant which is down in Farragut. So I'm very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| with his operations. But unfortunately we have an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| there. I understand. And you were aware of that. I'm sure I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| was. So I did amend that motion and I think Mr. Councilman Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| seconded Miss Martin. The only thing we'll be waiting for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| liquor by the ounce permit because this file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| I just want you all to be sure you remember that. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| would be the documentation that would be necessary. Right. For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| this to be approved. That's my location. And beer boards always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| a funny thing because at some level we are if the boxes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| all checked in we have to approve it and we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| this and we have to do that. I get worried about those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| where we start making this a completely administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| decision. And I don't I don't want to go down the road of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| saying final documentation is a liquor by the drink permit or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| task program or the the background check. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| there's some of those things. So I'm going to actually be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| voting against this. I would much prefer a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| That's right. I concur with Vice Mayor Becker. I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| say essentially the same thing. And I'll add I'm in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| interest of consistency which we talk a lot about here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| trying to treat all our applicants the same. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| recollection is that with the Hill we decided that multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| postponements were preferable. I believe I remember a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| about approving the Hill based on final documentation when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| got down to just that liquor by the drink permit. And they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| have some difficulty and it lasted several months. But we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| kept doing it as a postponement rather than a subject to final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| documentation. So I in the interest of fairness to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Hill and others that have been in this situation I cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| support the motion to approve based on final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| And I agree. You know we've never done that before. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| postponed several. One to not previously to this. That would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| be setting a real bad precedent I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| I'm not sure how everyone voted on this in the past but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| going to remain consistent and vote for it because that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| will not get his beer permit until the documentation's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| So I'm perfectly comfortable with that. And I know we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| we've discussed this and we've given our viewpoints and and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| forth and I respect others but I've I've just believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| when he gets his when the documentation comes in from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| state and it's we see it then it's it'll be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=966)|

| 0:16:26| Shall we move it would it be appropriate then to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| motion to postpone? Move to reconsider for purposes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| postponement. Second. I don't really need to. That was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| was just a motion. That was not OK. Thank you. I'm sorry I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| didn't hear that comment. It was not it was not a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| deny it was a motion to approve it subject to final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| documentation. You did not approve that motion. So you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| really back on the table for some other motion. My motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| would be to postpone. I'm sorry I didn't hear that. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| I didn't hear that motion. My motion would be to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1020)|

| 0:17:24| before that if you bring it before the office there would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1044)|

| 0:19:53| never heard of it lists Our Lady of Sorrows old Roman Catholic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| at forty six oh five lines to Pike and is could you enlighten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| me a little bit. Is that a former site of a church that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| still did that when the gentleman went out to measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1207)|

| 0:29:00| like to bring. Hard knocks pizza. Back up for reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| if there are sufficient votes and I'll go ahead and explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| my concern. I don't have a problem with with the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| ultimately. I recall other very successful businesses that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| been located there. My concern is the inaccuracy in. Back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| my concern lies with both the church that we mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| previously and the daycare. Listen to the school section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| there's a Sesame Street daycare which I've never heard of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| may exist on Hamburg but pride and joy academy and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Montessori school are much closer to this location. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| guess my concern lies with the fact that this is a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| that I know well. So I realize it's inaccurate. Other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| restaurants if I don't know the neighborhood as well I might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| not realize that there was a school or church. And so my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| concern is twofold. One. How do we account for that in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| application process. Does the inspector who goes out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| measure just measure based on the information that's provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| by the business owner in which case if there is a school or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| church or funeral home that's closer then we're missing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| because we're relying on the applicant's information. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| second concern is if if for some reason the Montessori school is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| within the 300 feet then we need to wait until this individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| gets their liquor permit before we ultimately issue the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| permit and our issuance of the beer permit would be out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| order this evening. So those are my two concerns. And so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| would like to move to bring this up for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Second. Just so you'll know in a meeting where where the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1833)|
| 0:30:43| happened in a subsequent meeting it would take six votes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| reconsider this. But because it's in the same meeting takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| five votes to reconsider. I'd like to know how we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| resolve your questions. And is the applicant still here? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| would say no. I realize that's that's a problem. I guess I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| would ask Ms. Day or Mr. Swanson if we if the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| we're provided is inaccurate and we Mr. Swanson or Ms. Day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| we vote on that and then we realize there's a church or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| funeral home or daycare that's closer. I mean ultimately this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| is a great location for a restaurant and I want that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| happen. But I also want to make sure that my responsibility as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| a beer board member is fulfilled. And if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| school that's close to this restaurant location and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| previous location has been out of business for more than six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| months then we need more accurate measurements to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| whether or not the beer permit can come first or whether we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| need to wait. Well let me let me start and then I'll pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| over. Initially it is the burden of the applicant to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| the facts that entitled the applicant to a beer permit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| it is the burden of the applicant to furnish accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| information to the city to the beer board. And if there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| information available to the beer board that would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| that the information is not accurate that would serve as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| perfectly valid basis to to determine what the accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| information would be. So I guess that's a long way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| the elbow of saying that it would be appropriate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| reconsider under these circumstances if you believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| that this information furnished by the the applicant is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| accurate. And I'll just add I know I'm out of order. I mean I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| don't think that they will fully provided incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| information. It would appear that maybe they're from out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| town or whatever. But because I'm familiar with this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I realize that there are a couple of inaccuracies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Now I do believe that we've already that they are not. No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| we. It was approved subject to final documentation was not so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| you have not yet supplied the permit to the African. OK. How| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| do we determine the. Do we just take the applicants indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| of the closest school or church. We strip. Excuse me. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| I'm finished. I'm sorry. All right. We stress to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| applicant that it is their responsibility to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| correct information. And if they were to ask us what to do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| would say you need to go out and look at your location and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| need to find the other locations that are near you. But we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| go behind them and verify everything. And if you do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| go behind them and verify everything you will not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| And I don't want to speak. I don't want to speak for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2015)|
| 0:33:43| engineering department but I would suspect that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| measuring what's been provided them and if they see I have I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| know that in the past if they see something else they'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| a note. I have seen where the applicant has noted that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| place or another is the closest school or church or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| and I've seen the measurement for that and then beside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| that a notation by the engineering department is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| other place although maybe closer still more than 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| or not within 300 feet in this case maybe. So sometimes if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| see it they do but but the burden is clearly on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| applicant. Councilman Woodhull. And Charles if if we approve an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| application that violates the distance requirement because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| either they they thought inaccurately what happens. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| mean that would be a valid basis to go back and and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| away the the permit. Part of this process is the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| required to furnish you accurate information and the failure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| provide you accurate information is a basis to deny a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| permit. Now you need to find in any event that if if they fail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| to provide you with accurate information. Number one that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| was a willful failure to provide you accurate information and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| number two that it makes a difference as to whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| they provided you accurate information. Since there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| accountability I guess there's perhaps in the culture of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| writing out filling out these applications there's they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| really saying I'm spending a lot of time analyzing the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| requirements but it doesn't necessarily make the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| application invalid. We would have to if if it does violate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| the distance requirement. I would say rather than making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| void it makes it void a bowl. As if that makes sense to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| Yes. Councilman Bailey. We've touched on this in the past. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| know I've sat over here on numerous occasions and looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| funeral homes and schools and thought you know just earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| maybe this one varies. Funeral home is listed as the closest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| one and I'd say Rose is probably closer and I've thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| this on numerous occasions and I guess I assumed that this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| checked. I never that's you know oversight on my part. I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| had a talk about this and before because this is a pretty big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| responsibility for us to individually check all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| distance requirements out and I I Councilman Roddy's uncovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| several of these and it gets sort of tricky when you have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| establishment that has had a permit before but it's been six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| months and so someone may go and assume that they can do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| because it's a best of pre-existing non-conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| situation. So you know this is this this this kind of you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| to me going back I know there's a number of these that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| approved that I would question the validity but I just assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| that you know it was checked out and maybe we ought to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| that in some way as a beer board that we could. Clearly it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| the beer boards obligation to to ferret out the correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| information and do the measurements and things of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| nature. I guess the issue that you might have is do you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| further burden the engineering department or somebody else some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| administrative part of the city to go behind the applicant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| find out this information. There's a cost to that. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| there's only so much. I mean if we're having personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| available and we talk about consistency if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| take this seriously we should. I mean it ought to be cut and dry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| it ought to be to the point we've had discussions downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| on direct lines of sight. We've talked about we've had a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| of issues like this before. Very I mean down to what was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| one the liquor store downtown was like six feet. So I mean we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| ought to just go by the book. I think you are going by the book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| it's just a question of whether or not you're being provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| accurate information. Yeah but I mean it ought to be it ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| be a cut and dry thing every time. No question about it. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| how do we address the fact that we've approved this pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| final documentation and yet they're not here. I do not think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| that would serve as a barrier to you all adopting a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| reconsider and asking them to to review the information and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| sure that they have supplied you with accurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Well can I just comment on something that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| evidently maybe I led to the misunderstanding. This is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| locate. I just happen to know about this because there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| very enormous engineering technicality that caused the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| owner of the development of the shopping center to have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| to a great deal of expense to remedy that. And I was called to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| hear those comments about a week and a half ago. So I happen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| know exactly where this is. Now I did not mean to indicate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| there was an established in this very established establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| in this very location. The establishment was actually a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| further east. It was the Greenhills Grill is standalone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| there behind the Montessori school. This establishment is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| within the shopping center the length of the shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| there which is just there's a driveway between Greenhills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| Grill and this portion of the build out of the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| This is a very small space and that doesn't matter but it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| very small space like twelve hundred square feet if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| remember correctly. And there was an engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| issue that had to be taken care of by the owner of the shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| center. So there has there has never been a restaurant in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| exact space. I think some of you all recall when a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| wanted to locate on the west end of Western Plaza. There was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| issue about the daycare. Well this and there was quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| lengthy discussion right miss a about that. So that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| ultimately approved. But this is on the other end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| shopping center much further away. That was directly across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| the street and it was just short of the three hundred feet. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| as far as the little church is concerned I think I know exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| where that is but I cannot tell you for sure that I have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| that name used for that old church. I made the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| that it was that same little congregation which is a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| unusual little congregation. But I may be quite wrong about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| that. And then it occurs to me that maybe they're using a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| space in the shopping center. I mean I don't know. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| Pelo do you know exactly where that location is. You know I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| You do. Could you just put an X on mine. Yes. I will try to. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| can tell you exactly where the building is. I posted it. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| the very back part. There's a runner's market I believe. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| on that back wall. Was it a store called Tulip. It's it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| right right up with a bicycle right there and the runner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| market was on the corner. Exactly where it is. So. No you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| cannot. But it would be right in. We're doing a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| reconsidering without reconsidering here. But I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| wanted to clarify that because it is not in the Greenhills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| Grill space. We're discussing reconsidering it. Right. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| I think now that they said Tulip I get cut what's left of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| hair down there at Western Plaza Barbershop right across the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| there. And you feel my pain don't you. And that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| be pretty doggone close to the Montessori school there. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| might be prudent. If I recall we measure property line to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| property line for the for the Montessori or the building line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| to building line. It's going to be it's going to be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| And yet the Greenhills Grill had a liquor and three other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| restaurants preceding it had a liquor permit. Well they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| liquor permits. Yes. That's a bigger part of that. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| correct. And those are closer to the school. But I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| comfortable and it's over 300 feet. So that's where I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| it is. OK. We've got a motion to reconsider. I guess we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| to consider that motion. If that's not what we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| doing. We ready to vote whether to reconsider. I apologize. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2576)|
| 0:43:04| didn't mean to. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed no. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2584)|
| 0:43:14| Call the roll. Vice Mayor Becker. Aye. Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| No. Councilman Frost. Aye. Councilman Hall. No. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| Holtquist. Councilman P. Lowe. Yes. Councilman Roddy. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| Councilman Woodhull. No. Councilman Bailey. No. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| right. It fails. I'm surprised. Ms. Martin. Oh excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2614)|
| 0:43:43| Councilman Becker. Yeah if if this site is not 300 feet away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| from the Montessori school what does happen. We would come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| next time and revoke their permit. You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| That's a possibility. OK. Mr. Chairman. Yes. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2639)|
| 0:44:07| curious. Now I can understand if there is a standalone business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| somewhere applying for a beer license that's too close to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| school church mortuary or whatever then we deny that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| permit. But in a case like this where they're surrounded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| people drinking liquor and we have to worry about whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| not they're proper with a beer license. Somehow we've I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| understand all that. How we can go through all the whiskey we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| want but we can't have a can of beer. Well that has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| the way the city ordinances is written. It's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| isn't that correct. Mr. Swanson. Well I think that's I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| that's the basis upon which in times past councils have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| concluded that that's the basis for that exception to the 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| foot rule. If you can drink whiskey at that location it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| doesn't really make sense to prohibit beer at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| because the drinking the whiskey arguably is going to be have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| more adverse impact on the individual than drinking of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| beer. You give them a lesser option is kind of the philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| that was behind that exception from the start. But I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| that's a that's a policy decision that's clearly within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| the scope of the city council to make a decision on that. To| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| date city council has decided that exception should exist and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| it does exist. I understand that but if the place we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| talking about applying for the beer license is surrounded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| people guzzling whiskey I don't understand what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| I understand what our rules are but by golly I mean something's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| out of kilter here. Councilman Bailey. Just to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| Councilman Becker's comment about if this is less than 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| feet what sort of action would would take place and I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| wondering is there going to be some measurement if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| going to measure measure this and bring it back to us because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| if if there are if it is then what about all the other ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| we've we've we've passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2774)|
| 0:46:23| You have issued a permit based on information in the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| that would authorize the issuance of a permit at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| once you've issued the permit it's enforcement activity beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| that and that's enforcement activity is really the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| prerogative of the administration rather than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| Miss Martin. You previously granted veggie Rama at twelve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| oh four north central some additional time to meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| requirements for the beer permit which you approved at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| December 16th meeting I believe the applicant is here to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090616?start=2817)|
