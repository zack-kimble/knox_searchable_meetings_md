| 0:00:00| The May agenda meeting has started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| Are there any Ã± I hope everyone has a copy of the agenda for May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=7)|
| 0:00:14| Are there any additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=14)|
| 0:00:20| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=20)|
| 0:00:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=21)|
| 0:00:22| You know, this is going to be a tight budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=22)|
| 0:00:25| and I would like to have a resolution there to ask the Clerk and Master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=25)|
| 0:00:32| to let us know of any of these attorneys that owe us court costs or any money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| and also the Election Commission, if anyone owes them any money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| and us find out how we've got to go about trying to collect it or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=41)|
| 0:00:45| because we're going to be in a very tight year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| I know everybody here knows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| And some of these people are walking, you know, slow walking about paying these bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| and we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| We need the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| I'd like to get that added to the agenda, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| I'd like to add a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| We'll find out what the law director thinks about it first here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| But I know Commissioner Pinkston is in favor of an elected school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| So am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| And I'd like to put forth possibly doing a resolution asking the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| to change the law to allow counties to decide if they wish to have a school superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=82)|
| 0:01:31| that's elected or appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| Mr. Law Director, do you think that that would be a resolution that we could put forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=94)|
| 0:01:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| So I'd like to add that to the agenda, if we could get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| Jolie or someone, get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| So if we could get that added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| It's just we're going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| I want to say that we've done that once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| Well, let's do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| I think, you know, the people are trying to decide how they want to do their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=118)|
| 0:02:05| how their local governments operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| And I think they should have the option to decide if they want an appointed school superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| or an elected one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| And I think the state ought to allow each county to make that decision on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| And I think we ought to also have that sent to every county in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| asking that they ask their state legislatures to support a law that would allow every county to decide on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=146)|
| 0:02:35| Some counties may want to elect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Some counties may decide to have it appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| But this way, it's decided at the local level instead of at the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| Commissioner Luthu, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| And this is a hot topic in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| It has been for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| And most of them realize that the people want an elected superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| Most of your legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Well, Mr. Pinkston or anybody else who'd like to put their name on this as a sponsor, you're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| I'd be happy to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| And I'd also like to add, Chairman, I'd like to see a possible resolution going likewise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| that would ask that the county commission does have some control over the money spent by the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| There are tight budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| You know, there's some things that we've spent money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| There's been some things that happened that obviously no one asked the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| They get the money and they spend it any way they want, any way they desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| And, you know, obviously we've got an increase of $19 million coming from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| And obviously whatever amount of money we give them, they're going to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| And I think that this year they've had an opportunity to cut back and roll some money forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| And they've opted not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| They've opted to go ahead and go on with some projects that I just don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| John, do you want to address the lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| Apparently what you may be talking about is revisiting the lawsuit that was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| On Monday night I appeared before, I appeared with the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| and we discussed the old lawsuit, which has an order of compromise in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=253)|
| 0:04:23| which was worked out between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| It was worked out between the school board and with the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| They each had their own attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| The county commission had Steve Roth representing it because the law director had to back away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| Only a couple of times in 18 years that my office has had a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| I mean, we can't obviously represent both heads of the client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| And the school board had Robert Watson to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| And the lawsuit was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| It was litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| It was right up to the point of trial when they worked it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| And the result of working it out was the order that I gave everybody a copy of last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=302)|
| 0:05:11| The school board, I was asked to draft a resolution for the school board this past month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| and it was to revisit paragraph two of that order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| which is for the school board to hire their own counsel instead of using the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| And the discussion at the meeting was that, well, they needed some advice on that in light of the Jordan case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=327)|
| 0:05:38| and how it may, if that were to play out today, how it might all play out if the litigation were to be more or less reinstituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=338)|
| 0:05:50| So they wanted some advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| I was asked to talk to Robert Watson, who represented the board, to come and address that at the next workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=351)|
| 0:05:59| which is Monday week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| I talked to Robert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Robert has declined to get engaged with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| I talked to Richard Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Richard has been around a long time, used to be the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| and can certainly give appropriate advice to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| And so he's agreed to come to the meeting Monday week and talk to the board and answer their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=382)|
| 0:06:33| It may be that some of the board members wish to revisit the entirety of the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| It may be that they don't wish to visit any of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| The only thing that was expressed to me was let's have somebody who can talk to us from the point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| from the standpoint of the lawsuit and from the standpoint of the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| And so since Robert wasn't willing to do it, then I've asked Richard to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=420)|
| 0:07:09| And so he will come and address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| So we can see, you know, certainly what they think about it here in very short order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| I just, I hear a tremendous amount from my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| Every time I'm out, if I'm at a school or something, that's what I'm questioned about is how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| and why can, do they have the right just to take the money and spend it any way they like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| Yeah, pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| We have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| You approve of the budget and more or less approve of it at the large, the 100 levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=455)|
| 0:07:43| And, you know, it's, they are set up to where they have their own board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| and they have certain autonomy and that's the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Mr. Law Director, how would the Jordan case affect this other lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| I just don't see the connection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| We're talking about a couple of things, looking at state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| You know, there's a state law provision that provides that the school board may hire their own counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=488)|
| 0:08:17| So they're looking at it from that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| You know, what trumps state law or our charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| Well, that's been the million dollar question for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| And we have to look at each situation independently and analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| And so that's what they're going through with that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| But it may be that they wish to revisit other portions of the order too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| or it may be that once they have asked all their questions and received their answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| it may be that they choose to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| I have something I need to add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| Lee Trammell has resigned from the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| so I need to have a resolution to select someone to replace him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| Does anybody mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| That would have to be Daniels or Elaine Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| It has to come out of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| It would be Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| I don't know if he wants to have the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| It doesn't have to be a commissioner, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| But it has to be somebody out of the 4th District though, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Somebody out of the 4th District, but it does not have to be a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| There's some confusion in the public about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| Basically, how were these persons who were relieved from their county commission seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=586)|
| 0:09:56| how were they able to continue to serve on the Board of Zoning Appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| And while it has been the practice of Knox County to always place a county commissioner on the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=600)|
| 0:10:10| it's not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| And that's why citizens are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| and they were able to continue on serving on the Board as citizens from the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| Well, that wasn't a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| You know, commissioners on the BZA has been a practice for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| but prior to that it was made up of citizens and different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| I mean, John, I don't remember the entire story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| but it seemed like they were having some problems with it, with that BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| And I know Mike Moyers had talked about why they switched over to using just commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| Do you recall the history behind that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| I know there's a history there that there was a reason why they decided to go with commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| but I don't recall exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| It was the commissioner's prerogative that they place commissioners on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=662)|
| 0:11:12| I mean, there can be a number of arguments in favor of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| but it's one of the most important boards in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Oh, I think definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| Very important board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| Mr. Chairman, did I understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Go ahead, Mr. Freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Go ahead, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Did I understand you say that you were nominating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| I was going to recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Is that something that the commission votes on or is it that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Okay, so we'll vote that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| I would just want to disclose that, you know, I am a builder, I'm a real estate agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| and I have developed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| And I'll be happy to serve the county any way I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| And I just don't want that being something, you know, as a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| But I just want you all to know that up front that, obviously, that's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| And I don't want that to cause the county commission any embarrassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| You're just talking about four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Well, as long as once he's on there, he can stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| That's how Mr. Kaywood and him stayed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| But Mr. Daniels type person, I know if he's not up here that he would step off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Is that your intentions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Commissioner, that you would resign your seat there when you come off the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| If that's the desire of the commission, I would be happy to step off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| There would be a conflict, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| I wasn't listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| What he does for a living as a builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| No, I mean, if he runs into any projects that are an issue before BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| he may have to disclose it and may have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Will you accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| Mr. DeFries, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Mr. DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Well, I was just wondering, Elaine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| do you have anybody that you would think of to assign to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| I mean, he is a builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| And he said that he's had a little bit of a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Would you have anybody that you would have in mind to bring forward for that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| Or are you fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| I'm fine with Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| I think he is a very man of integrity and knows how to make good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| And I trust his and respect his decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| William, with the comments that you made about you're exactly what we're looking for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| and you have enough integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| If there's a conflict of interest, you're just going to recuse yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| But, you know, we want somebody like you then that would hit the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| You're familiar with what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| So when somebody comes with a problem, you can empathize with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| and you'll know exactly pretty much what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| I think you'd be an excellent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I might even vote for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| Just need nine more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| Mr. Chairman, just by means of information, the legislature has passed the cable TV bill, the AT&T bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| I'm not real sure of the status of our cable TV committee, but I will let this body know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| We may not even need a cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| And then, again, we might as to what the duties of that committee might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| I'll investigate that and let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Secondly, the Bill Dunn bill has passed, which allows us to communicate via website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| John Gustin is working on it as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| We can't go live with it until July 1, but it has been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| We will be able to communicate via website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| So I just wanted to let everyone know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| We were just able to download that from a website, and so we'll have a motion before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| Has it been signed by the governor yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Before very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| So does that mean that we'll be able to communicate online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| In light of the injunction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Well, he will need to go to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| I'm sure you'll go to the judge and let him know that the bill has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| But, again, we can't do it until July 1, but I think it's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| We'll make sure that the court is okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| Would there be a chance at that time to ask any other questions, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=915)|
| 0:15:23| I will do what I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| I hear you talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Commissioner Freese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I would like to go on record as supporting the resolution that Commissioner Craig Leuthold mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| So if anybody has taken note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Secondly, you passed out the proposal for auction of the Old South High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=938)|
| 0:15:46| I took it upon myself to contact Dick Sturkey, who is with Comcast Spotlight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| on getting some advertisement of the auction, which is going to take place June the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| And these are some proposals that he set forth, some different types of campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| The first one is, you know, it has several networks listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| The next campaign, number two, there's a limited list of networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| And at the bottom, you'll notice that the Atlanta Braves games, CSS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| is a network that picked them up this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| And the Atlanta Braves games will be on Friday evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| And for a 30-second commercial, we could pay $20 for each primetime commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| And so this is just, I just wanted to present this to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| We contacted, Jolie helped contact Hugh Holt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| and he said that we don't need specifically a resolution to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| But I just wanted to have some discussion from the other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| what you thought of this type of advertising of liquidating our assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| and possibly considering a resolution to using Comcast Spotlight in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| to help advertise liquidation of buildings or surplus properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| What are the production costs of a commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| We'd have to have a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| The media guy would ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Well, I mean, this is going to be a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Yeah, that's just to air it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| I'll find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Would this be in lieu of the new Sentinel ads or in addition to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| The Knoxville new Sentinel only hits a third of the Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| So this, you know, I just feel that this would be light years ahead of advertising the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| and any future properties that Knox County may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| What's our law, Mr. Law Director, with regards to posting this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| We have to do it in a newspaper of records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| I was about to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| We have a contract with the new Sentinel as far as our advertisements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1070)|
| 0:18:00| What she's talking about is something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| Hugh thinks that, I guess, we can do this as part of a sale of a property for a one-time deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| Is that right, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Hugh is actually going to meet with Dick Sturkey tomorrow at 10 o'clock in our office, and that will be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| But in answer to your question, the ad was put in Sunday's newspaper so that we have met that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1105)|
| 0:18:33| Would the cost of this come out of the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Or how would this work in terms of the money that would go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| And I'm not against my colleagues in the media getting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| We all know we need it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| But $4,000 is still $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Is this going to come out of the sale proceeds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| How would this be paid for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| Well, I guess it depends on what the costs are associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| But that would seem to me would be a matter we could look into, and I think that would certainly be something we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| Does your office, Mike, have a budget for publication and advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Yes, sir, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| But this would come out of the property management's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| Do you think we need to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| I really can't speak for Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Mr. Holt just spoke with the gentleman this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| I think as many times as we have attempted to sell this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| or bid the property out and have been unsuccessful, I think, you know, it may be something worthy of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1184)|
| 0:19:53| Mike, do you guys have any numbers on what it costs just to keep that property in the condition it is today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| mowing grass, taking care of insurance, anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| I don't, but Mr. Holt does, and I certainly can get that information for you, give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Would you like me to have it to the next meeting, or how would you like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| If you could, send it to all the commissioners, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| The cost to maintain the property, landscaping and so forth, mowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Anything, insurance, I would say the insurance on that building is probably horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| Are we self-insured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Well, but there's still a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Mr. Daniels, where we really have a problem at is not mowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| and everything, but it's trying to maintain that building in the shape it is, keep it from falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| My understanding is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| And that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| It's probably costing more than what this advertises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| I think, I believe it was in 2004, could have been early 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| that they had to go over and patch that roof and spent about $9,000 just patching the roof at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| It was either the latter part of 2004 or the early part of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| Am I correct on that, Mr. Reeves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| That's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| It's what we have to do to maintain the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| And that's what I'm getting at is, you know, this may be minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| If we can, if someone else would like to take the building, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| we get rid of just the cost to maintain it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| and somebody can put something in there that's worthwhile, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Mike, if you could send that to Jolie and she can fax it out to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| We'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Chairman, I just got off the phone with Dick Sturkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| I just called him to answer Commissioner Harmon's request about how much it would cost to put together a 30-second commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| And he said $150, $175 to put together a 30-second commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| So I just wanted to be able to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| And I also have requested from Hugh Holt, and he had that ready for me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| and I was going to go by and pick that up, but how they have spent $15,000 to try to rid this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| And is there a way, Mr. Law Director, would that be a violation of the Sunshine Law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Once I get those records, which should be open records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| can I hand that to Jolie and have her fax that to all the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| so we know how $15,000 have already been spent on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1328)|
| 0:22:19| You know, any information can be sent to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1339)|
| 0:22:27| It would be nice if it went through, I think, instead of from one commissioner to others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| if the conduit for that was Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| They'll provide the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Then it can be faxed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| So I can just ask Hugh Holt to fax that to all commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Ask Hugh Holt to provide the information to Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Commissioner Hammond, they want you to star in that little commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| No, I was going to suggest that we have either Ms. Davis or Ms. DeVries star in the movie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| or star in the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| You can do the Vanna thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| All these commercials are 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| You could do the voiceover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| And actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| Promoting another station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| Had to get him fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| He's got plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Hmm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| The 30-second commercial would be start out maybe possibly with a script, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| white on black saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| one of the best development opportunities in many years is happening soon in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Then have shots of the school and property, mention the date and time of the auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| and show the property again with a map, you know, how close it is, close to the boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| and just have some audio to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Just be sure to show the highlights in its best light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| It's amazing what you can do with a computer nowadays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| Aren't there some old pictures out there that you could use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| But it still had a roof and windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| If you'll let Hugh Holt, though, do most of the communication with Jolie, I mean, that would definitely be preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Are there any additions or deletions or withdrawals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| Mr. Chairman, I have two proposed, if we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| The first one would be review of the audit report of the medical examiner's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| so the commission can receive that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| Is that report ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| No, but it should be ready by committee date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| He said this is the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Yeah, the audit of the medical examiner's office, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| And the second item is clarification and possible approval of the independent annual financial audit contract for 07-08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1490)|
| 0:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Jolie, note it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Mr. Law Director, did we not vote to have the state come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1505)|
| 0:25:15| I'm not sure whether the state is able to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| I mean, that's the other part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| And we can talk further at committees, but I've had discussion with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| and for them to staff up to do this job, they need some more lead time than what they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| and that's part of what the discussion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| The clarification is I don't think the state will be ready to do this in this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| That's the way our vote was, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| It depended on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| If the state was, then I think we need to put it out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| We'll have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| So that's the clarification that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Yes, I had two issues, and these really are directed at the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| The first is, and this gets back to the appointment of the medical examiner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| do we have the information available now, the letter, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| from the Knoxville Academy of Medicine with their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| and does that meet the state law and the traditions that we've used to appoint a medical director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| I do not know if we have it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| I don't know if they've had a chance to meet since our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| They have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| I haven't seen the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| I think it was composed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| I just wanted to be certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Do they have a name yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| There's only one person over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| You know, someone comes from out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| The person doesn't have to be a forensic pathologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| but there's only one forensic pathologist over there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| And I think it's important for the forensic center for this to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| because they really can't hire anyone else until this appointment is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| The second issue that I was going to ask the law director about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| and I think maybe some other commissioners from the 5th District may have received telephone calls over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| are people landing aircraft in their backyards out in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| And I got a partial answer from one person on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| but is this something that we can handle at the county level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| or does this have to be handled at another level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| These are rotary wing aircraft, in other words, helicopters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| That'd have to go before BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| It's scheduled on the agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Yeah, I've got a resolution asking MPC to take a look at the county ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| and to come back with their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| But the individual with the helicopter has put it on BZA for this month, asking for the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| I think I've had a conversation with Bruce about it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| and Bruce is already going forward with action as far as that goes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| My understanding is, I'm a certified flight surgeon also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| but my understanding is that for an aircraft to land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| there has to be an FAA-approved site for that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| And I know that that's handled more at the federal level than it is at the county or state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| but that might be another option for us to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| As a county body requesting that the FAA look at that, that might be a quicker resolution to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| I'm not sure that even if the MPC approves it, if it's still legal or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| because I believe that you have to have the FAA's approval to have a landing site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| Well, he's got to have BZA's approval, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| They've got to grant a waiver, and it's coming before BZA this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| Where was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| In the back of Commissioner Hammond's house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| You've got a tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Number seven here, the appointment on the IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| Mr. Law Director, I believe that may be the commission's appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| I'll have to look at it, Commissioner, and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| You know, and if it is, I'd certainly like to have someone in the ninth district on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| But I believe that's, you know, if we aren't careful what we're getting into here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| it's like our PBA appointments here several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| When it got right down here to the front, it turned out to be a commission appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| and we gave it to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| I believe this is the commission's appointments, but I'd like you to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| And also, I would like, I probably didn't make myself clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| but any time any appointments are being applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| I would like the direction from the law department on it telling whose appointments these are to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| whether they're a commission, mayor, or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| We have a provision in our charter, you know, that addresses a good bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Yeah, but we don't know it, you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| We don't know whether we have the power or whose appointments they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| But I believe these appointments are actually the commission's appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| And, Paul, I want to take it one step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| I want to make sure it's evenly split out so it's not just everybody from one area of town, you know, spread it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Well, there's four here, and if it turns out to be our appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| since I'm the first one to holler about it, I want one out of the nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| Well, I'd like to add to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| I see that we've got an appointment of one, which I would presume is the first time they've served on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| But I see a reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| And to be honest with you, I don't know either three of the gentlemen that are asking to be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| But I think before we reappoint, we need to see who else out there could possibly be someone that would fill one of those spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1841)|
| 0:30:50| I don't think just reappointing three people that I don't know who they are, I don't have a clue what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1850)|
| 0:31:00| You know, I think we've seen a lot of people through this last election cycle that want to be involved in what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1860)|
| 0:31:09| And I think that we ought to see if there isn't some other individuals that would be interested in serving in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| Something else you might want to ask for, Commissioner, is how long have they served on these boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| That's another great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| If this is going to just be like their second term, then that might be, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| that falls within what we're under here as term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| Or if they've been there forever, then that might make a difference in your decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| Could you ask that they get us a resume, John, on these IDB appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| Could you ask them to provide us with a resume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I will make that request, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| I mean, I'd just like to see the process we went through with appointments for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| I mean, obviously, these are some extremely important positions as we've seen the last few months, just how important they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| And, you know, I think that we need to give the public an opportunity to participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| And there may be some people that would like to be involved that, you know, aren't on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1931)|
| 0:32:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| I want to just real quick, we had Mr. Emerson here in the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| I want him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| We're looking at resolution number 49 on the liquor sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| And John wanted to come in and address the group just real briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| Mr. Emerson, if you can just give us just a two or three minute real quick to the podium and we'll do it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| and finance and intergovernmental we'll go into a lot more detail, but just real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Good job, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Yes, it's John Emerson, E-M-I-S-O-N, 9212 Topico, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1968)|
| 0:32:59| My comments will be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| I'm President of Citizens for Home Rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| As I think probably most of you are aware, we are a 28-year-old private property rights advocacy organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1988)|
| 0:33:19| And we maintain at present about 150 lawsuits, I think, in Chancery Court where our members have been annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=1999)|
| 0:33:34| I want you all to know that I'm here as a private citizen, unpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| This is on my own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| I also want you to know that I have no financial interest in this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| I don't have any property or any interest in any enterprise or endeavor that would be benefited if this agenda item carries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2027)|
| 0:33:58| or would be harmed if it fails to carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Our interest in this particular agenda item is to take off the table the situation that presently exists that would require a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2042)|
| 0:34:22| or a package store to either locate in the city or locate in an area where it can be voluntarily annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2062)|
| 0:34:34| And to those I know who are likely to oppose this, perhaps on moral grounds or other basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2074)|
| 0:34:45| who perhaps think that we don't want liquor by the drink in Knox County, I'd point out we've got it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2085)|
| 0:34:55| The fact is that these restaurants that locate are going to be able to be voluntarily annexed in many situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2095)|
| 0:35:12| And I would argue that the local community that's affected by such an enterprise will have a greater amount of say in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2112)|
| 0:35:21| greater amount of control if that's done within the county so that those people are represented by you commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2121)|
| 0:35:34| and the rest of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| And I'm sure you're all aware that they'll probably hold you accountable for things that they like or dislike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2136)|
| 0:35:48| There are other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| Any proposition that allows greater freedom in the location of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| and business investment is good for revenue, it's good for the economy, it's good for jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2158)|
| 0:36:07| and it gives greater consumer convenience and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| And I hope that and ask for each of you to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| and allow the citizens of Knox County to vote on this and decide for themselves whether they want to pass this proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Commissioner DeFreeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| I was thinking back to the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Can we put a district number beside those also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| Or does that not necessarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| Do we normally recognize which district they're from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| You could ask for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| If you have John Troyer have that added to the list of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Could we do that, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Let me go ahead and follow up real quick on what Mr. Emison said and see if there's a way to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| I don't know if we can get this information or not, but with regard to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| is there any way that we can get any sort of statistics or information from either the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| or somebody like that with regard to a number of any sort of estimate with increasing DUIs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| or what sort of impact that will have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| If we follow through with selling liquor by the drink, how will that increase their patrols, their staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2255)|
| 0:37:43| Will it increase numbers in the jails that are already close to maximums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| Those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Who do we need to direct those kind of questions to to get that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| I'm sure the Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| He would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| So just call them and ask them and request that information from them to have at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Then the other thing is I was hoping that Commissioner Pinkston would sponsor this for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| a resolution honoring the Destination Imagination Team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| that we gave some money to those because, see, we only get two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| but you're going to be here a little bit longer than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| So I was hoping that you would put forth a resolution honoring them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| and that group that are going to compete in the global competitions that are going to be here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| And can we all co-sponsor it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Let me answer, Elaine, your question there talking about the Sheriff's Department and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| You know, now, this is why and the reason that we're looking at doing it is because times are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| You work at a restaurant, and if I'm 77 years old and I ask for a drink, they're going to card me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| And Mr. Law Director, you may correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| if somebody gets hurt after they leave a restaurant and has a wreck and kills somebody, can it come back to that restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2334)|
| 0:39:04| There's been a lot of litigation over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| See, it's a lot tighter than what it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| And that's why I just think that, you know, the time is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| I mean, you're making good points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| but I think the restaurant industry has done a really good job themselves of policing themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| and keeping themselves out of lawsuits too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| I'm just saying that, obviously, there's going to be more opportunity for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| if you're going to have more opportunity to drink, there's going to be more opportunity for accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| And so I'd just like to know if there's any way to quantify that information for us to kind of weigh the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| Okay, how much are we going to get in sales tax versus how much are we going to pay for in jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| in personnel costs, in tying up our court system, those sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| and kind of, you know, use that to try to weigh our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| It's self-control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| I think the sales tax issue probably wouldn't go before J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| I don't know where you can get, I guess, ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| This is the law director there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| You know, the city has ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| There has to be so much food sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| That cuts out from just a saloon, you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| We might ought to look at the city's ordinance on that and maybe sort of adopt it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| I think there has to be so much food sold before they can sell that group of the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| I'm looking at the whole issue, and hopefully I'll have all the information that we need at the meeting, at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2422)|
| 0:40:31| It's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| We actually haven't looked at this since Dwight Kessel was the county executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2432)|
| 0:40:42| I know he had a conversation with our office during his last year, and then it just kind of dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| I'm looking into the whole matter and to see whether we need a resolution or an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| We put it on as a resolution, but it may, in fact, need to be voted on in two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| I'm sure there are some other requirements too, so I'm looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| You know, I just think we need to be so much food sold there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| We don't want to create just bars is what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| The set-ups will be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Another board would approve up or down and set the regulations how far away from the church, school, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| ABC would regulate the sale of liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| It wouldn't be a beer board issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| I also get carded, but I prefer to think that it's because of my youthful and virile look rather than age, but, yeah, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| You mentioned restaurants that also it's going on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| Explain to me the restaurants when you can bring in your own bottle of wine, for example, and pay a cork fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| Is that a county ordinance or is that a state law that you can do that, and how is that policed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| You're allowed by virtue of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| So a lot of places are already doing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| You can bring in your own bottle of wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| But you can't bring in liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| You have to use those little vials to put in your pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Yeah, like the ball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| Hey, listen, I've spent a lot of time in honky-tonks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| You know, one thing, John Empson, you left out was the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| You can have liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| So an area of Knox County that you can have a package store or liquor by the drink, but the town of Farragut gets to control that, not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2548)|
| 0:42:44| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Chairman, I just wanted to say, Commissioner Smith, I live in an area where, along Johnsonville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| where annexation has occurred down Alcoa Highway just to pick up a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| Actually, they did annexation along the river to pick up near Marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| And then on the other side, we had the halls, not the halls, where they put the Home Depot, and they annexed that too, the Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2581)|
| 0:43:11| I'm sorry, the Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| And so I've seen that come on either side of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| And I live in the county, and there's a lot of residents there that are concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| So I think that there are some issues in here that are above moral implications that, you know, pretty soon everything's going to be city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2598)|
| 0:43:28| You know, because the county, there's a lot of places in the county that have restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| So I do look at, I understand Commissioner Davis's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| but I also understand the people out in my community that are concerned because we're being annexed all around us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| just so the restaurants can get liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Well, and this would stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| If we're a line of businesses, and it stops with Mr. Pinkston, and Mr. Pinkston wants to bring it to the city so he can sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2625)|
| 0:43:54| we as business owners and the subdivisions that are behind us, we're scared to death that after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| then they're going up there and get us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| This would stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Yes, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| For the law director, I think it was the 2002 Urban Boundaries Agreement that limited annexation to a certain degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| but this finger annexation has continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| And I believe that the Boundaries Agreement expires this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| It doesn't expire this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| No, the only thing that expired after the seven years was that the subdivisions, neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| that were designated as subdivisions that are located within the urban growth boundaries could not be annexed for seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2676)|
| 0:44:48| but the plan itself is a 20-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| But what you get into here, Mr. Briggs, is if anybody asks to be annexed, even though they're in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| the city can annex them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| And that's what we're getting into with these restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| They want liquor but the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| And so they ask the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| And so they ask voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| That's in the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| It can't be annexed unless the person asks to be annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| I appreciate the clarification on that, because I haven't been clear exactly how that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| It's a confusing issue, and a lot of people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| And that's what Mr. Graham did out your way, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| He asked to be into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Into the city so they could get restaurants for liquor but the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| See, we've got the same thing in Hollis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| We're building two huge things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Mr. Graham's one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| He's building one out one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| And as far as bars, we have beer joints in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| They can only sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| I mean, they can't sell wine or any other type of alcohol, but they can serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| And where this really hurts the county is on this annexation of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| We don't lose our property tax, but we lose the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| It's what we lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Now, we still get $0.72 that goes to school because that's state law, if I'm not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| But we lose the $0.28 to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Right now, we're depending very heavily on sales taxes, you'll see, because of the state when this budget comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2770)|
| 0:46:21| Chairman Strickland, could I make one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Will you finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| This is in response to Dr. Briggs' question, which is a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| The legislature, unfortunately, gave Tennessee municipalities the authority to annex outside their urban growth boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2794)|
| 0:46:44| anywhere outside their urban growth boundary, even in the rural designated areas, if it's done by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| We've already had one referendum where there was a single voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| One man, one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| And so this would take that off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| This sort of action would take that off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| And a lot of you may not know this, but with Knox County being a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| really the only service, the only service that the city of Knoxville or even the town of Farragut can provide that Knox County cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2837)|
| 0:47:27| is liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| It's the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| We have a sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| If we wished, it would be cost prohibitive, but we could have a fire department if we wished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| We could provide garbage pickup if we wished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| There's streetlights if we wished to pay for all that through a property tax, but we choose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| The city of Knoxville chooses what services they want to provide through their property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| But the only service that the city of Knoxville can provide that the county cannot by state law is liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| And so I think that's what gets back to the reasons that you see a lot of restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| and some of this finger annexing was to get the benefit of that one service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| They would voluntarily be annexed, and then you had all this finger annexation going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| and then they would spread out somewhat from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| And it's left a lot of people in a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| Like where I live, I am completely surrounded, although I live in a county only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| I'm completely surrounded by city boundaries, which are supposed to be illegal in the state of Tennessee, but it has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| That's happened to me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| I just had a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| How does this impact clubs such as like Getty's View, Country Club, those sorts of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| Will they be able to sell liquor by the drink as well or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Private club, they're regulated by ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| They do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| They were actually annexed by the city, even though the rest of Getty's View wasn't, just so they could serve alcohol to the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| It was one of those finger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Getty's View is actually inside the city limits as far as the clubhouse and the golf course itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| The homes there are county only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| I think they came down the railroad tracks or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| I'm not thinking about the electric wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Electrical wire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Larry, would this be on the agenda in August, do you envision, or November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| I'm going to get it for August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| Mr. Chairman, I just want to mention real quick, this is no way anything against Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| I have the utmost respect for him, city council members, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| I just think it's a way that we can stop some annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| and let's put some ease at some people's minds out in the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| and get some things out there that I've been asked for for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| I say Farragut's got it and the people that are inside the city, they've already got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| So we're just trying to make it level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| Mr. Emerson, would you come up to stand just a moment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| You're a little bit more knowledgeable on this than me, but on the referendum in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| I believe that applies to just subdivisions and people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Is it that businesses cannot ask for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| That's why they had to say this guy lived there in this referendum we had over in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| It's my understanding that in the voting statutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| and Mr. Owings, I'm sure, will please correct me if I'm mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| that the Election Commission does not have the authority to register a person to vote on the basis of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3039)|
| 0:50:49| if their residence is actually a commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| So that's what I was trying to say to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| It has to be an individual that asks for that referendum, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Well, I would assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| It has to be a voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| I really feel like that this was done illegally in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| and we were fighting it and we got it put off and put off up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| some commissioners did, until it was, you know, too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3073)|
| 0:51:21| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| If not, motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| I'd just like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| But I need to ask if there's anyone from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| I'd just like to tell the media that this coming meeting this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| we're going to honor the World War II veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| and we're going to try to have something for them before the meeting in the small conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| We've been told Chuck Jones has been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| We're trying to come up with all of the veterans, World War II veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| and we are having a difficult time, as you might imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Most of these folks are probably 80 to 90-plus years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| So if the media would, if you would contact myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| or Chuck Jones and the Veterans Affairs Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| we really need to get you all to broadcast this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| and let it be known that we're looking for their names and addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| Obviously, some of these, since the last address we have, have been moved to homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| But even if they're in a home and they can't get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| we want to make sure that they get their document honoring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| So it's something I think is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| We need to honor all of our veterans, but we've chosen at this time to do the World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| So I'd love to talk with any of you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| It is something that we need to get out there and get some help with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| Chairman, can I co-sponsor with Commissioner Smith item number 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| And I didn't know if there was any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| No, it's not item number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Item number 49, and I just want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| are there any other commissioners that would like to co-sponsor that on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3189)|
| 0:53:16| You might need to go to Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Where have they gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| They just walked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080507agenda?start=3205)|
