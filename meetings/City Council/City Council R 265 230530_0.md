| 0:02:43| So now, time for my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=163.0)|
| 0:02:47| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=167.0)|
| 0:02:48| It's nice to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=168.0)|
| 0:02:49| I wanted to share with you some really good news we had over the long holiday weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=169.0)|
| 0:02:56| Early Saturday morning, the Knoxville Fire Department had its first ever baby box alert at Station 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=176.0)|
| 0:03:03| The crew immediately went to the box and found a healthy baby boy inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=183.0)|
| 0:03:08| The child was transported to the hospital and is in good condition tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=188.0)|
| 0:03:12| The baby box was installed in February, and it is the first in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=192.0)|
| 0:03:17| At the time of installation, we said if just one life was saved from this box, it would be worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=197.0)|
| 0:03:24| And I can tell you when I got the phone call about this, it was a relief to know this resource was in our city and likely saved this baby's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=204.0)|
| 0:03:32| So again, the baby box is designed to be an anonymous surrender for any parent who needs a place to turn in a time of crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=212.0)|
| 0:03:39| So thank you to our firefighters, and Chief Cheeseman is here with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=219.0)|
| 0:03:43| Thank you to the firefighters who have trained to use this baby box and who acted quickly this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=223.0)|
| 0:03:49| So a round of applause for our firefighters who saved a baby's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=229.0)|
| 0:03:52| Also, council members, you already have this on your calendars, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=232.0)|
| 0:04:00| But two days from now, we have our next community open house meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=240.0)|
| 0:04:04| This one is out in West Knoxville Thursday, June 1st, 430 to 630 p.m. at Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=244.0)|
| 0:04:12| Residents are invited to attend any time during the event to talk to city staff and partner representatives about projects located in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=252.0)|
| 0:04:20| Some of those projects include improvements on Pleasant Ridge Road, KUB Fiber Internet, Kingston Pike Complete Connections, Lakeshore Park and West Hills Park, neighborhood traffic calming, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=260.0)|
| 0:04:32| You can go to KnoxvilleTN.gov, West Knoxville, for more information on the open house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=272.0)|
| 0:04:37| So I hope to see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=277.0)|
| 0:04:40| And also, another big event that's coming up just around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=280.0)|
| 0:04:44| We are gearing up for the long-awaited groundbreaking for the new multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=284.0)|
| 0:04:48| This brief ceremony is slated for 9 o'clock in the morning, June 13th, at 400 East Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=288.0)|
| 0:04:54| We hope to see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=294.0)|
| 0:04:57| And before we move on, I want to say a big thank you to Jeff Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=297.0)|
| 0:05:01| Jeff, this is your, I believe, your last council meeting as director of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=301.0)|
| 0:05:08| Jeff, you graciously stepped into this role after 35 years with planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=308.0)|
| 0:05:14| And in addition to your 35 years in various roles as executive director of TPO and then stepping into executive director of the whole department, you've done tremendous work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=314.0)|
| 0:05:25| And you have my respect and the respect of your peers across the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=325.0)|
| 0:05:30| So please join me in thanking Jeff Welch for his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=330.0)|
| 0:05:34| And a quick reminder for those who wish to speak, either to a specific agenda item or during public forum, should sign up with Mr. Johnson, our city recorder, ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=334.0)|
| 0:05:50| And council rules state that up to three people each may speak for or against an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=350.0)|
| 0:05:56| And right now, many more than three people have signed up for item 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=356.0)|
| 0:06:02| So I would ask the various people who signed up to consider huddling in the back of the room and confirm which three speakers you would like to prioritize on this topic before we get to that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=362.0)|
| 0:06:15| And other rules to follow in public forum and other times you're speaking at the podium, please do not use profanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=375.0)|
| 0:06:24| And when speaking to specific agenda items, please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=384.0)|
| 0:06:28| Those who fail to adhere to these rules may be ruled out of order and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=388.0)|
| 0:06:33| For those who are listening, please note that you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=393.0)|
| 0:06:37| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=397.0)|
| 0:06:39| Thank you in advance for everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=399.0)|
| 0:06:41| And that concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=401.0)|
| 0:06:44| Are there any reports from council members or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=404.0)|

| 0:07:17| Just a matter of technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=437.0)|
| 0:07:22| Apparently the screen behind me is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=442.0)|
| 0:07:26| I don't know why people are being asked about it, but it might not be fixed during this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=446.0)|

| 0:08:27| Item 9A is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations for the several departments, agencies, and funds of the city of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2023, and ending June 30, 2024, and providing the authority to reappropriate non-project-related encumbrances at the end of fiscal year 2022-2023 into fiscal year 2023-2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=507.0)|
| 0:08:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=531.0)|
| 0:08:52| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=532.0)|
| 0:08:54| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=534.0)|
| 0:08:57| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=537.0)|
| 0:08:58| Yeah, I just wanted to get out in the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=538.0)|
| 0:09:04| Mr. Brace, we had had some conversations about some concerns about staffing funding for the building department and some of the delays in processing because huge work volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=544.0)|
| 0:09:18| And there's some staffing and there's some recommendations from the consultants to staff up a little bit larger than what's proposed in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=558.0)|
| 0:09:28| So let me just talk about that and what is and isn't being addressed in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=568.0)|
| 0:09:35| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=575.0)|
| 0:09:37| I mean, I'll just give you a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=577.0)|
| 0:09:39| This budget does include two new positions and council approved another new position during a budget amendment in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=579.0)|
| 0:09:45| So we've added a total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=585.0)|
| 0:09:47| If you approve this tonight, it'll add three new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=587.0)|
| 0:09:50| Is that right, Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=590.0)|
| 0:09:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=592.0)|
| 0:09:53| And then we're also in the process of, you know, trying to improve the digitization of plans, reviews, and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=593.0)|
| 0:10:01| And we're also in already have a contract out to we do have a backlog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=601.0)|
| 0:10:05| You know, business has been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=605.0)|
| 0:10:07| People want to invest in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=607.0)|
| 0:10:09| And that backlog, we're going to need to we're going to hire an outside entity to help us address that backlog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=609.0)|
| 0:10:16| So with the new positions, with the outside help, and the automation, which in theory should make things easier for our customers, we're going to wait and then in six months reevaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=616.0)|
| 0:10:27| And if we still believe at that time we need more permanent positions added to the city staff to address these permits, then we'll evaluate that and bring a proposal to council middle of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=627.0)|
| 0:10:41| Is there anything to add, Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=641.0)|
| 0:10:43| Mayor Kinney, you may mention later in the meeting there's ordinance recommendation to move neighborhood codes from Mr. Aaron shop and building inspections to public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=643.0)|
| 0:10:54| This is a kind of twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=654.0)|
| 0:10:55| One is to better connect our neighborhood codes enforcement officers with the managers and foreman that are out in the neighborhoods every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=655.0)|
| 0:11:02| But it's also to allow Mr. Aaron's and his team time to strictly focus on new investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=662.0)|
| 0:11:08| So that is a fourth portion of how we want to make that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=668.0)|
| 0:11:13| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=673.0)|
| 0:11:14| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=674.0)|
| 0:11:15| So I appreciate hearing about tapping into some consultants or contracts that kind of helps address the surge and then reevaluating as we get into the year to see how that flow is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=675.0)|
| 0:11:28| It's great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=688.0)|
| 0:11:29| Everybody wants to build something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=689.0)|
| 0:11:32| It's hard on the employees as well as the folks want to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=692.0)|
| 0:11:36| If we can't provide the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=696.0)|
| 0:11:39| I know Mr. Cannon said it before at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=699.0)|
| 0:11:43| The city doesn't get to turn away projects like private industry does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=703.0)|
| 0:11:47| We have to serve and give out permits and review plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=707.0)|
| 0:11:51| And it's just been a big challenge of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=711.0)|
| 0:11:54| Folks come to us and complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=714.0)|
| 0:11:56| They go to you guys and complain and they complain to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=716.0)|
| 0:11:59| And so I appreciate that you guys are working on some solutions to address the backlog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=719.0)|
| 0:12:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=725.0)|
| 0:12:08| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=728.0)|
| 0:12:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=731.0)|
| 0:12:14| And thank you to my colleagues for allowing an extension, allowing a postponement for the second vote so that we could have a little bit more time to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=734.0)|
| 0:12:28| I appreciated that time and was able to develop some clarity around a few issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=748.0)|
| 0:12:36| Definitely not all issues represented in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=756.0)|
| 0:12:42| But still had some pretty significant concerns that I've been able to express to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=762.0)|
| 0:12:55| One of those is the level of investment that we're seeing in our housing versus other parts of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=775.0)|
| 0:13:11| We've been able to increase the level of funding going towards housing with some federal dollars that have come available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=791.0)|
| 0:13:21| And so now we're seeing those budget numbers decrease in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=801.0)|
| 0:13:26| But meanwhile, we're seeing other parts of our budget continue to increase in particular public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=806.0)|
| 0:13:33| And I feel as a city, we're missing an opportunity to address some root causes in our community that could actually take the load off of our public safety officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=813.0)|
| 0:13:50| And that's where I would like to see more investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=830.0)|
| 0:13:54| One thing that I talked to the administration about is that in this extreme housing crisis that so many cities and states are experiencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=834.0)|
| 0:14:06| other areas have decided to, rather than commit, as we are, 5 million or more this year, a little over 7 million, towards affordable housing each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=846.0)|
| 0:14:24| they've made a large commitment of perhaps 100 million that can be spent in a shorter amount of time to bring many more affordable housing units online more quickly than if they had spread that goal out over a 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=864.0)|
| 0:14:47| And I'm worried if we do not make such commitments that we will continue to see folks in our community get pushed out of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=887.0)|
| 0:14:58| folks in our community who are experiencing extremely desperate financial situations, which leads to some of those public safety issues that we're experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=898.0)|
| 0:15:11| Other cities have been able to invest those dollars through municipal bonds, which is how we pay for our public facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=911.0)|
| 0:15:21| These are things that we are able to budget for over time and spend down over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=921.0)|
| 0:15:28| It's one of the lowest interest rates you can get for these types of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=928.0)|
| 0:15:36| So that's what I would like to see moving forward, is that we are not settling on a plan for affordable housing that was acceptable a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=936.0)|
| 0:15:51| but that we're responding to the immediacy, the urgency of this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=951.0)|
| 0:15:56| So I would like to see that increased in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=956.0)|
| 0:16:00| I'm concerned about our commitment to Title VI and to preventing discrimination in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=960.0)|
| 0:16:10| We have this new report that was just shared with us from Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=970.0)|
| 0:16:18| One thing that struck me when I was thumbing through that report was the level of discrimination racial minorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=978.0)|
| 0:16:27| particularly black members of our community, are experiencing in the housing market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=987.0)|
| 0:16:32| and our obligation as a city to address when members of our community are struggling to access housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=992.0)|
| 0:16:42| There are other parts of the budget that I have concerns with, and I'm hoping to make a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1002.0)|
| 0:16:52| I'm not going to make a proposal tonight. I'm not going to propose a budget amendment tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1012.0)|
| 0:16:58| But as we continue to talk about needed services in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1018.0)|
| 0:17:04| I hope that Council and the administration will remain open to budget amendments that will address those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1024.0)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1033.0)|
| 0:17:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1043.0)|
| 0:17:26| I want to comment on, thank you, Councilwoman Bryder, for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1046.0)|
| 0:17:30| I have a question about, you said stopping was increased by two positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1050.0)|
| 0:17:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1055.0)|
| 0:17:36| What was requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1056.0)|
| 0:17:43| I'd have to look at the exact number. It ranged between seven and twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1063.0)|
| 0:17:46| Some of those, it was the matrix report and how we actually looked at some other resources in the city and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1066.0)|
| 0:17:54| But the number was around seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1074.0)|
| 0:17:57| And again, we added one in a budget amendment. We've got two in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1077.0)|
| 0:18:01| And I think what the Mayor had discussed previously was we could add 20 right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1081.0)|
| 0:18:06| but by the time those individuals get on board, get trained and up to speed, it doesn't help our backlog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1086.0)|
| 0:18:11| So what we have in the interim is a contract right now, a small contract with Canaan & Canaan to help with those reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1091.0)|
| 0:18:18| We will be bringing City Council a larger contract to go ahead and try to get the backlog work through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1098.0)|
| 0:18:24| get these individuals hired, trained, and then we'll reevaluate and see where we are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1104.0)|
| 0:18:29| So I think this housing urgency that both Councilwoman Bryder and Parker were talking about is our number one concern in Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1109.0)|
| 0:18:41| By the time we would have trained and had six other members working, I think right now we're just playing catch-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1121.0)|
| 0:18:49| This is going to continue. This isn't going to end any time soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1129.0)|
| 0:18:52| And it's time for kind of throwing everything in. Yes, it's affordable housing, but it's also the middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1132.0)|
| 0:18:59| And it's time for some radical solutions and to really focus our resources on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1139.0)|
| 0:19:04| There are so many people I know that are stuck in bad situations in housing or in no-housing bad situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1144.0)|
| 0:19:13| They're just stuck. I mean, it's all levels of income, mostly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1153.0)|
| 0:19:23| Councilmember Singh, thanks for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1163.0)|
| 0:19:30| I would just say, yes, I recognize that we are in a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1170.0)|
| 0:19:36| Kevin DuBose is a relatively new Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1176.0)|
| 0:19:40| and one of the top priorities I've asked him to do is develop a housing strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1180.0)|
| 0:19:46| and how we do some things differently and faster and address these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1186.0)|
| 0:19:51| And yet, at the same time, I do want to say that we, this Council and this administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1191.0)|
| 0:19:56| have done more to invest in affordable housing than ever in the history of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1196.0)|
| 0:20:01| I'm really proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1201.0)|
| 0:20:02| I think we're going to see some things opening soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1202.0)|
| 0:20:05| First Creek at Austin continues to build out their spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1205.0)|
| 0:20:10| Transforming Western is moving apace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1210.0)|
| 0:20:14| So we're not doing nothing by a long shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1214.0)|
| 0:20:17| We're doing a lot, but I don't disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1217.0)|
| 0:20:20| Mayor, I think we're doing good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1220.0)|
| 0:20:23| But this is a crisis situation when in all of the country we're one of the worst markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1223.0)|
| 0:20:29| We're doing one of the worst in the whole country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1229.0)|
| 0:20:31| So, you know, I was trying to figure out, well, what is our responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1231.0)|
| 0:20:35| What did the city, if the city government has a role in this, where did we fall down in this disaster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1235.0)|
| 0:20:44| Yeah, well, I'd say a lot of it is the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1244.0)|
| 0:20:49| I agree. That is a big factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1249.0)|
| 0:20:52| This is a free market, and we cannot control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1252.0)|
| 0:20:55| But, yeah, I'm just very concerned what our part is and what we can do differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1255.0)|
| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1261.0)|
| 0:21:02| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1262.0)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1263.0)|
| 0:21:04| I just want to say that I agree with what my colleagues have been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1264.0)|
| 0:21:10| This is kind of an extension of a conversation that we had in our legislative budget hearings that really is dealing with affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1270.0)|
| 0:21:18| And what you're hearing is the effects of supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1278.0)|
| 0:21:23| If I remember correctly, I think Plans Review had two positions that they were asking to be filled that hadn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1283.0)|
| 0:21:31| And I'm very encouraged to hear about looking at the backlog because obviously we need to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1291.0)|
| 0:21:39| I think we also need to look at whether or not we need a budget amendment to add those two additional folks with Plans Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1299.0)|
| 0:21:46| I think what was being said is that we do a really good job with public-private partnerships to encourage housing, and we need to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1306.0)|
| 0:21:56| There's a limit to how much we can actually accomplish there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1316.0)|
| 0:21:59| The bigger piece of this is encouraging the private sector to do this because we just can't do enough supply ourselves on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1319.0)|
| 0:22:10| So we need to address that by dealing with the backlog and then decreasing the time that people are dealing with permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1330.0)|
| 0:22:16| and using some of our tools to encourage mixed use along the corridors where we have a lot of access to transportation and other amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1336.0)|
| 0:22:27| that we can then use to continue to build the housing that we really desperately need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1347.0)|
| 0:22:34| So I just want to say I agree with what all of you are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1354.0)|
| 0:22:37| We are doing some good things, and we need to do some more as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1357.0)|
| 0:22:40| And I know the mayor is committed to doing that, and I am too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1360.0)|
| 0:22:43| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1363.0)|

| 0:23:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1404.0)|
| 0:23:25| I had some questions around the number of vacancies we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1405.0)|
| 0:23:31| I think, Ms. Gill, we traded some emails back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1411.0)|
| 0:23:34| Mr. Evans, thank you for spending time for me to help me understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1414.0)|
| 0:23:37| It's my understanding that if we have any vacancies at the end of the year, the compensation for those vacancies rolls into the unassigned fund balance at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1417.0)|
| 0:23:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1427.0)|
| 0:23:49| Boyd Seven, CFO for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1429.0)|
| 0:23:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1432.0)|
| 0:23:54| It's commonly called higher lag vacancies because we budget for spaces, not faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1434.0)|
| 0:24:01| If you have that, by the time overtime is applied against it and any other shortfalls that you might have had, anything that is extra goes into unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1441.0)|
| 0:24:13| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1453.0)|
| 0:24:14| And anything that's extra within that budget rolls into those applicable departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1454.0)|
| 0:24:18| Is that right, before the unassigned fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1458.0)|
| 0:24:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1463.0)|
| 0:24:24| Unassigned fund balance is the last place the money goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1464.0)|
| 0:24:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1469.0)|
| 0:24:30| And I just want to call out that I think that's about $4.3 million based on what I was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1470.0)|
| 0:24:34| And I just want to highlight that I'll support this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1474.0)|
| 0:24:38| I plan on supporting this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1478.0)|
| 0:24:40| I do realize we raise taxes, property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1480.0)|
| 0:24:43| We still have very low property taxes, but we raise those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1483.0)|
| 0:24:46| And in an effort to avoid doing that for as long as we can, there is some savings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1486.0)|
| 0:24:51| And so we've chosen collectively to put that in the budget for next year and not to save those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1491.0)|
| 0:24:56| I just want to make sure that we don't touch any of the unassigned fund balance when we have some of that discretionary funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1496.0)|
| 0:25:03| So that $4.3 million that was left over from the vacancy savings, we're choosing to disperse that to the individual departments applicably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1503.0)|
| 0:25:13| So I want to make sure that we don't touch the unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1513.0)|
| 0:25:17| I don't think that's an accurate description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1517.0)|
| 0:25:20| Mr. Boyd, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1520.0)|
| 0:25:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1522.0)|
| 0:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1523.0)|
| 0:25:24| Let's take a look at it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1524.0)|
| 0:25:28| We did this at a point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1528.0)|
| 0:25:30| I think it was on the 8th of May, 8th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1530.0)|
| 0:25:34| And we had for the vacancies that existed at that time, and those go up and down daily because people are always being hired, people are always leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1534.0)|
| 0:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1545.0)|
| 0:25:46| But it was around $9.867 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1546.0)|
| 0:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1549.0)|
| 0:25:50| Well, the projected overtime, annualized overtime in excess of the budget for the entirety of the FY would be $5.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1550.0)|
| 0:26:02| So you track $9.867, $5.213, and then you've got to take out the delta from the projected, in other words, revenues less expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1562.0)|
| 0:26:15| and that's about $3.915 million due to higher than normal operating costs due to inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1575.0)|
| 0:26:22| And you're left with around $738K projected operating balance just in that area for FY23, and that does roll into unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1582.0)|
| 0:26:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1594.0)|
| 0:26:35| So my only point is that vacancy savings dollars that is not spent on personnel rose into each departmental budget for whatever projects are remaining for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1595.0)|
| 0:26:48| So we spend that excess personnel budget at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1608.0)|
| 0:26:52| And so what I'm saying is that's fine, but we shouldn't be using unassigned fund balance in the near future if that's the case because I want to prevent having to raise taxes as long as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1612.0)|
| 0:27:03| We don't spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1623.0)|
| 0:27:05| Anything to spend unassigned fund balance comes to you all on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1625.0)|
| 0:27:10| Yeah, and I'm referring to the operating budget, not the unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1630.0)|
| 0:27:15| I'm not following you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1635.0)|
| 0:27:16| Well, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1636.0)|
| 0:27:17| But I'm just going to put out there that we spend unused dollars that we do not spend on employees that are unhired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1637.0)|
| 0:27:25| We spend that on other projects in the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1645.0)|
| 0:27:28| And what I'm saying is we should be very careful and try to save that when possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1648.0)|
| 0:27:33| We're not doing it in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1653.0)|
| 0:27:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1656.0)|
| 0:27:37| I think that's not exactly my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1657.0)|
| 0:27:40| It is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1660.0)|
| 0:27:43| I just wanted to point out, though, that the whole point of raising taxes was to address shortcomings where we had high-level vacancies in public service, high-level vacancies in finance and police and some in fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1663.0)|
| 0:27:57| And to a great extent, those raises have been effective in filling out our ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1677.0)|
| 0:28:03| And so our department directors do not want our chiefs and our directors want to fill their ranks and in many cases want more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1683.0)|
| 0:28:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1692.0)|
| 0:28:13| So they're highly motivated to hire and retain good quality people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1693.0)|
| 0:28:17| And now because of the compensation study, that has been a huge help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1697.0)|
| 0:28:21| So there's always some turmoil or lag in hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1701.0)|
| 0:28:26| And so those savings just go back to unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1706.0)|
| 0:28:32| If they're unused for overtime, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1712.0)|
| 0:28:34| But it's not like they're using money that was allocated to salary to buy furniture and computers or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1714.0)|
| 0:28:43| Anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1723.0)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1724.0)|
| 0:28:46| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1726.0)|
| 0:28:47| That's not my understanding either, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1727.0)|
| 0:28:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1729.0)|

| 0:39:54| And lived in East Tennessee my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2394.74)|
| 0:39:58| Spent my formative years in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2398.2599999999998)|
| 0:40:00| I'm a proud graduate of Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2400.38)|
| 0:40:03| And growing up here in East Tennessee, you love football, you love basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2403.98)|
| 0:40:07| I loved boxing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2407.58)|
| 0:40:09| And growing up, my mother used to tell me stories about the heavyweight champion from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2409.58)|
| 0:40:13| Knoxville, Big John Tate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2413.98)|
| 0:40:16| And I chose photojournalism as a career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2416.66)|
| 0:40:20| And once I realized I could use my platform to tell the stories that meant something to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2420.06)|
| 0:40:24| me, the first big project I pursued was the story of Big John Tate, his life, his career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2424.14)|
| 0:40:30| And I learned that he grew up illiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2430.94)|
| 0:40:33| He couldn't read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2433.18)|
| 0:40:34| He couldn't write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2434.18)|
| 0:40:35| But he could punch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2435.18)|
| 0:40:36| And that punch led him to Knoxville, to the Golden Gloves Gym in Chihuahua Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2436.54)|
| 0:40:42| It led him to a bronze medal in the Olympics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2442.06)|
| 0:40:44| It led him to the World Heavyweight Championship in 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2444.64)|
| 0:40:49| The fight was in South Africa during apartheid, during segregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2449.64)|
| 0:40:54| And his fight, his heavyweight championship fight, was held in a stadium that was desegregated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2454.3599999999997)|
| 0:40:59| for the first time for that fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2459.8799999999997)|
| 0:41:02| 80,000 people came to see Big John Tate win the heavyweight championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2462.2)|
| 0:41:06| And he brought it back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2466.68)|
| 0:41:08| Mr. Robert Booker said that Big John Tate was the biggest thing to come out of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2468.92)|
| 0:41:14| until the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2474.0)|
| 0:41:16| And he had a championship fight here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2476.16)|
| 0:41:18| He lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2478.6)|
| 0:41:19| And then his life kind of spiraled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2479.6)|
| 0:41:22| It was tragic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2482.32)|
| 0:41:23| He battled with addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2483.8)|
| 0:41:26| He battled with homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2486.12)|
| 0:41:27| But his story is a very human story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2487.44)|
| 0:41:29| He died at the age of 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2489.84)|
| 0:41:32| Very tragic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2492.72)|
| 0:41:35| But I did this documentary about Big John Tate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2495.14)|
| 0:41:37| And once I finished this documentary, I watched it through for the first time, I felt something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2497.68)|
| 0:41:42| that I never felt in the 15 years that I had done videography, and that was the feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2502.44)|
| 0:41:47| that I did my absolute best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2507.4)|
| 0:41:50| And Big John's story inspired me to do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2510.7200000000003)|
| 0:41:54| And I know with this street renaming, his name can inspire others in the community to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2514.76)|
| 0:42:00| do their best as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2520.04)|

| 0:45:40| I just noticed in rule 18, order of debate, we're able to debate without a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2740.08)|
| 0:45:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2748.08)|
| 0:45:50| We have several people signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2750.08)|
| 0:45:55| In council rules, as you all know, it's three people, four, and three people again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2755.08)|
| 0:45:59| So let me count the number of people who have signed up so you guys know what the full number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2759.08)|

| 0:46:17| 13 people have signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2777.08)|
| 0:46:30| At the beginning of the meeting, I encouraged members who wanted to speak to select spokespeople| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2790.08)|
| 0:46:36| so they could conform to council's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2796.08)|
| 0:46:39| Have you all selected three spokespeople?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2799.08)|
| 0:46:42| All 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2802.08)|
| 0:46:45| Well, council, I'll start calling them in the order in which they signed up, and after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2805.08)|
| 0:46:52| three, we'll conclude unless there's a motion otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2812.08)|
| 0:46:56| I'd love to go ahead and make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2816.08)|
| 0:46:59| Particularly on this issue, I've just found that folks are coming to this issue with different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2819.08)|
| 0:47:03| perspectives that I think would be useful for council to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2823.08)|
| 0:47:07| Of course, I do not know who has signed up, what perspectives they're bringing, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2827.08)|
| 0:47:13| would move to suspend our rules to allow the speakers to speak, if I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2833.08)|

| 0:47:26| When we've done that in the past, we just adjusted the time from the five to the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2846.08)|
| 0:47:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2851.08)|
| 0:47:32| So do you want to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2852.08)|
| 0:47:34| Don't we need a second before I can make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2854.08)|
| 0:47:39| Unless there's not a second, and then you can just make a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2859.08)|

| 0:47:51| Ms. Parker made a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2871.08)|
| 0:47:53| Ms. McKenzie seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2873.08)|
| 0:47:55| I'll make an amended motion that everyone signed up to speak speaks that the time limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2875.08)|
| 0:48:00| is three minutes to amend our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2880.08)|
| 0:48:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2882.08)|

| 0:48:07| Is there a second on the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2887.08)|

| 0:48:59| there's 30 seconds left, I'll just like wave my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2939.08)|
| 0:49:01| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2941.08)|
| 0:49:02| And if you could start by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2942.08)|
| 0:49:05| Amelia James, 1925 Aylor Ave, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2945.08)|
| 0:49:10| So I am a licensed clinical social worker here in Knoxville and a member of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2950.08)|
| 0:49:16| Heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2956.08)|
| 0:49:17| So Knoxville Heart has been bringing up this idea of having an alternative response team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2957.08)|
| 0:49:22| which are teams that pair a medic and behavioral health professional to respond to certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2962.08)|
| 0:49:27| 911 calls in Knoxville for the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2967.08)|
| 0:49:31| What we've consistently heard from you all is that many of you support alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2971.08)|
| 0:49:37| You understand that the people in our city have a lot of mental health, substance use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2977.08)|
| 0:49:43| and housing and houselessness concerns that are going unaddressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2983.08)|
| 0:49:48| You understand that police are overburdened when they are required to respond to calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2988.08)|
| 0:49:53| that they don't have the proper support or training to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2993.08)|
| 0:49:57| You understand that police presence can escalate someone who is already in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=2997.08)|
| 0:50:03| You've also posed a lot of questions to us over the past few years on how alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3003.08)|
| 0:50:08| response teams would logistically function in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3008.08)|
| 0:50:12| And that is why I wholeheartedly support the creation of the alternative response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3012.08)|
| 0:50:17| task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3017.08)|
| 0:50:18| This task force would not exist to check some sort of symbolic box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3018.08)|
| 0:50:23| It would be composed of key stakeholders in our community and give everyone an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3023.08)|
| 0:50:28| to come together to create a tangible proposal on how we can make alternative response a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3028.08)|
| 0:50:34| reality in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3034.08)|
| 0:50:36| So in addition to my work as a mental health therapist, where I work directly with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3036.08)|
| 0:50:40| in crisis every day, I also provide trauma-informed de-escalation trainings to businesses, social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3040.08)|
| 0:50:47| service agencies, and community advocacy groups in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3047.08)|
| 0:50:52| One thing I consistently hear at these trainings is what do we do when we use all our de-escalation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3052.08)|
| 0:50:58| skills and we still need more support but we don't want to involve police because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3058.08)|
| 0:51:03| know that involving police in these situations is going to increase harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3063.08)|
| 0:51:07| Right now, I unfortunately don't have an answer for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3067.08)|
| 0:51:10| But we could have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3070.08)|
| 0:51:12| We could have alternative response teams in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3072.08)|
| 0:51:15| Alternative response teams improve outcomes for people in crisis, free up police time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3075.08)|
| 0:51:21| to respond to other calls, and save significant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3081.08)|
| 0:51:25| Change can be scary and overwhelming, but I really hope that we can come together with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3085.08)|
| 0:51:29| some bravery and innovation and try something new because this matters that much and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3089.08)|
| 0:51:34| people in our city matter that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3094.08)|
| 0:51:37| We have community support for alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3097.08)|
| 0:51:40| If you see everyone here in red shirts, we have community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3100.08)|
| 0:51:44| We have the support of Chief Noel and we need your support now to vote yes on creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3104.08)|
| 0:51:50| this task force so we can take one step closer to making alternative response a reality in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3110.08)|
| 0:51:56| Knoxville and making Knoxville a safer city for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3116.08)|

| 0:53:18| Alongside our supporters, we're the ones getting this idea out into the community and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3198.08)|
| 0:53:22| sure this conversation continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3202.08)|
| 0:53:24| We even coined the term alternative response teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3204.08)|

| 0:53:48| We must acknowledge that we are here because of the incredible work of black organizers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3228.08)|

| 0:54:21| What we've heard from the city is there aren't resources or administrative capacity to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3261.08)|

| 0:54:47| is that public trust is vital to a successful alternative response program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3287.08)|

| 0:54:59| We cannot repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3299.08)|

| 0:57:34| I understand that our police officers are being asked to do roles and fulfill functions for which they have very limited training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3454.08)|
| 0:57:42| People like me have training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3462.08)|
| 0:57:44| We know that alternative response models reduce the necessity of that higher level of care, including inpatient admission, inpatient treatment, ER utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3464.08)|
| 0:57:56| We know that alternative response models decrease low crime, anything in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3476.08)|
| 0:58:03| You can look at some of the Denver Star as well as the Cahoots out of Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3483.08)|
| 0:58:08| They have data that supports that for every time we use an alternative response model, we save $400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3488.08)|
| 0:58:16| Over time, that's a $22 million savings annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3496.08)|

| 0:58:36| Interactions with law enforcement are scary to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3516.08)|
| 0:58:42| And as someone who has to convince people who look like me to trust me enough to contact people to help them, and then the help doesn't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3522.08)|

| 1:00:04| I do not have the training that the friends who spoke before me or the friends who will speak after me have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3604.08)|
| 1:00:13| I don't know that a lot of you have that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3613.08)|
| 1:00:18| So I'm asking, so that's why I'm asking, we need to listen to these folks who have the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3618.08)|
| 1:00:33| I do know something that I can speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3633.08)|
| 1:00:36| Last week at the park meeting, and I don't think I saw a whole lot of you all there last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3636.08)|
| 1:00:45| but I do know two things I took away from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3645.08)|
| 1:00:50| Chief Noel is not here, or I would be looking right at him, making eye contact with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3650.08)|
| 1:01:00| Eye contact is very important when you are talking to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3660.08)|
| 1:01:05| I taught my kindergartners 29 years to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3665.08)|
| 1:01:10| It's just good manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3670.08)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3675.08)|
| 1:01:17| Chief Noel said two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3677.08)|
| 1:01:19| I wrote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3679.08)|
| 1:01:20| I put it in my phone, but now I can't find it, so here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3680.08)|
| 1:01:26| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3686.08)|
| 1:01:29| It is not, and I'm pretty sure I'm quoting him, feasible to have two officers in the transport wagon, the vehicle, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3689.08)|
| 1:01:44| taking friends who are in crisis to the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3704.08)|
| 1:01:51| It is not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3711.08)|
| 1:01:53| That's a real important word when you're talking about budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3713.08)|
| 1:01:58| What would make that feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3718.08)|
| 1:02:01| What can you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3721.08)|
| 1:02:02| What can you do to make that a thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3722.08)|
| 1:02:06| I asked Chief Noel, what if that transport driver has a wreck on the way to the detention center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3726.08)|
| 1:02:16| They only are allowed two hours to get that person to the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3736.08)|
| 1:02:21| What happens after that two hours is up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3741.08)|
| 1:02:23| Thirty seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3743.08)|
| 1:02:25| The other thing that he said, and he asked in a very, and some of you who were there in the audience, you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3745.08)|
| 1:02:35| he asked for donations to the police department for those things that, those machines, help me out, friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3755.08)|
| 1:02:44| those defibrillators, because they're expensive, and the police department, the city of Knoxville, cannot afford to have those machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3764.08)|
| 1:02:59| Ms. Sparks, that concludes your three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3779.08)|
| 1:03:02| I thank you for your time, and I thank you for voting, please, for Resolution 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3782.08)|

| 1:03:33| Anyone see Mr. Brinkley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3813.08)|
| 1:03:35| All right, we'll move on to the next person, Kent Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3815.08)|

| 1:03:56| I'm Kent Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3836.08)|
| 1:03:57| I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3837.08)|
| 1:04:01| Good evening, Mayor and Council Members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3841.08)|
| 1:04:04| I'm commenting in support of Alternative Response Team Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3844.08)|
| 1:04:08| I would be tasked with developing a pilot program to implement Alternative Response Team in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3848.08)|
| 1:04:15| Alternative Response is actually pro-police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3855.08)|
| 1:04:20| CAHOOTS, an alternative response program in Eugene, Oregon, responds to 17% of Eugene Police Department's overall calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3860.08)|
| 1:04:28| Albany Law School found the city saved an average of $400 each time that CAHOOTS was dispatched instead of police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3868.08)|
| 1:04:36| resulting in estimated annual savings of over $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3876.08)|
| 1:04:39| It's a small city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3879.08)|
| 1:04:40| Not bad, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3880.08)|
| 1:04:42| The key point here is that the Eugene Police Department likes the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3882.08)|
| 1:04:47| Reducing the number of instances in which police are called to assist Eugene's unhoused population reduces the number of calls for which their skill set is a poor match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3887.08)|
| 1:04:57| Crisis workers are able to successfully and safely respond to nonviolent calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3897.08)|
| 1:05:03| Our police department is currently understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3903.08)|
| 1:05:07| Alternative Response would allow existing staff to cover more of the calls for which police are properly suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3907.08)|
| 1:05:13| On October 2020, L.A.'s City Council voted unanimously to develop a CAHOOTS-like program of unarmed crisis responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3913.08)|
| 1:05:21| I think our own police chief says that it is possible here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3921.08)|
| 1:05:25| A Stanford University study found that Denver's Alternative Response program resulted in a 34% drop in low-level crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3925.08)|
| 1:05:33| Let's make Knoxville safer and freer from crime and kinder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3933.08)|
| 1:05:38| Thank you for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3938.08)|
| 1:05:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3944.08)|
| 1:05:45| The next person signed up to speak is Sam Armbruster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3945.08)|
| 1:05:51| Mr. Armbruster, you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3951.08)|
| 1:05:55| State your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3955.08)|
| 1:06:09| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3969.08)|
| 1:06:10| My name is Sam Armbruster, 2700 Parkview Avenue, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3970.08)|
| 1:06:18| I'm speaking as someone who has lived and worked in Knoxville for the past six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3978.08)|
| 1:06:25| I've worked in community mental health, actually alongside Ebony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3985.08)|
| 1:06:31| I've worked in harm reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3991.08)|
| 1:06:33| And during that time, I've built relationships with lots of organizations and, more importantly, lots of people living in our community who have been deeply impacted by houselessness, by the ongoing housing crisis, the ongoing overdose crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3993.08)|
| 1:06:55| And one thing that I realized over that time is that we need more tools in our toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4015.08)|
| 1:07:02| And I think that alternative response is a really essential tool that we could easily add and that supporting 11C would give the opportunity to figure out what that could look like in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4022.08)|
| 1:07:16| One example that is really close to my heart and the work that I have done over the past six years is thinking about the ways that the overdose crisis has impacted our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4036.08)|
| 1:07:32| I know from the work that I do that the vast majority of people who respond to overdose are not police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4052.08)|
| 1:07:42| It's people who are in community with other folks who use drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4062.08)|
| 1:07:46| They're reversing overdoses of loved ones, of friends, of the people that they really care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4066.08)|
| 1:07:53| And that is something that's deeply, deeply traumatic, both for the person who is overdosing and for the person who is reversing that overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4073.08)|
| 1:08:04| And so many of those people, after the overdose is reversed, choose not to seek emergency services out of fear that the person who reversed the overdose or the person who was overdosing or anyone who's present is going to be arrested for something like paraphernalia charges or a warrant or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4084.08)|
| 1:08:29| And we all know that arrest is not going to make the life of someone who just effectively died and came back better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4109.08)|
| 1:08:39| But what if we imagine a world where someone can come and help them process that trauma and help them make sure that they're physically OK and get them the support that they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4119.08)|
| 1:08:54| I think that's the world I want to live in, and I think we have a really easy tool that we can employ to make that happen for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4134.08)|
| 1:09:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4144.08)|

| 1:09:24| I live at 1330 Granger Avenue in Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4164.08)|
| 1:09:30| And I, like others, I'm here tonight to express my support for Resolution 11C and to urge you to allocate funding to an alternative response team task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4170.08)|
| 1:09:41| Alternative response teams safely and effectively redirect vulnerable individuals away from the criminal legal system and towards the social services that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4181.08)|
| 1:09:54| Alternative response teams can help prevent escalation, improve outcomes for individuals experiencing mental health crises, contribute to more equitable outcomes for people of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4194.08)|
| 1:10:06| and others that are disproportionately impacted by the criminal legal system, and save cities money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4206.08)|
| 1:10:14| Alternative response teams also reduce the burden, as others have noted, on law enforcement and traditional first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4214.08)|
| 1:10:22| As Chief Noel recently noted on a panel at UT College of Law, most of the calls that KPD responds to are not violent crimes and sometimes aren't even crimes at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4222.08)|
| 1:10:33| So when alternative response teams can, so in some of these situations, excuse me, alternative response teams can be dispatched instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4233.08)|
| 1:10:42| So when a parent is struggling with their child and desperate for help, or a daughter is worried about a parent's mental health, or a grandparent is concerned about a grandchild overdosing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4242.08)|
| 1:10:53| or a resident is worried about the safety of a person who's pacing up and down their street and is very obviously experiencing a mental health crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4253.08)|
| 1:11:02| a trained behavioral specialist and medical professional, rather than a law enforcement officer, can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4262.08)|
| 1:11:10| As you continue to deliberate tonight, I hope that each of you will think about what you would want if you or a family member or a friend or a neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4270.08)|
| 1:11:19| were experiencing an acute mental health or substance use crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4279.08)|
| 1:11:25| Who would you call? Who would you want to respond? And what would you need in that moment of crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4285.08)|
| 1:11:33| I know what I've wanted when I've been in some of the situations that I've just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4293.08)|
| 1:11:38| And as a researcher who's been studying how contact with the criminal legal system affects children and families for more than two decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4298.08)|
| 1:11:45| I also know what the data say. It's time for us to expand how we think about safety and how we respond to people in crisis in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4305.08)|
| 1:11:54| Providing funding for an Alternative Response Team Task Force is an essential first step, and I hope that you vote to approve Resolution 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4314.08)|
| 1:12:04| It's a safety issue, it's an equity issue, and it's an economic issue. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4324.08)|
| 1:12:15| The next person signed up to speak is Tyler Givens. Mr. Givens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4335.08)|
| 1:12:34| Hi, my name is Tyler Givens. I live in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4354.08)|
| 1:12:39| City Council Members and Mayor, you've heard the voice of the people here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4359.08)|
| 1:12:45| Look at this diverse crowd of faces and voices that want to do better for our people that are facing crisis in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4365.08)|
| 1:12:55| You've heard convincing arguments, expert opinions, lived experience, and the hopes of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4375.08)|
| 1:13:03| Please support this resolution. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4383.08)|
| 1:13:09| The next person is Brady Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4389.08)|
| 1:13:25| Hello, Brady Watson. I live in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4405.08)|
| 1:13:29| I too am not an expert. I don't have a whole lot else to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4409.08)|
| 1:13:33| I will say I think the folks you need for this task force are in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4413.08)|
| 1:13:36| You have a lot of brilliant, really experienced people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4416.08)|
| 1:13:40| I don't believe the resolution actually names who will be on the task force, but again, I encourage you to look for the folks in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4420.08)|
| 1:13:48| You have the data. They know the data. They know how this can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4428.08)|
| 1:13:53| I think what I really want to stress is that when, hopefully when, you pass this resolution and create this task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4433.08)|
| 1:14:00| and once eight months is up and they have a recommendation to implement a pilot program, you actually do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4440.08)|
| 1:14:06| We know we need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4446.08)|
| 1:14:09| People are suffering because we don't have this model. It's worked elsewhere. It can work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4449.08)|
| 1:14:14| So again, I just encourage you to pass this resolution and eight months down the road to actually implement what the team develops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4454.08)|
| 1:14:22| We know it can work. We know we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4462.08)|
| 1:14:25| KPD has said we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4465.08)|
| 1:14:28| The officer, one of the officers from the Lisa Edwards case, said some things I didn't agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4468.08)|
| 1:14:33| but he did say that he never should have been there, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4473.08)|
| 1:14:36| And so, again, please vote for this, and please make this happen. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4476.08)|
| 1:14:44| Next person signed up to speak is Hasan Atachan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4484.08)|
| 1:14:49| You have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4489.08)|
| 1:14:52| My name is Hasan. I'm a lifelong South Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4492.08)|
| 1:14:56| As we face unprecedented challenges, increasing overdoses, houselessness, displacement, addiction, mental illness, suicides, death by gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4496.08)|
| 1:15:04| and the confluence of these factors at once, our people deserve policies, programs, and funds that reflect the needs of our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4504.08)|
| 1:15:12| and that show us that you take our losses, our pain, our trauma, our lives and deaths seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4512.08)|
| 1:15:17| I, along with several community orgs that together represent thousands of Knoxvillians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4517.08)|
| 1:15:22| ask for the establishment and funding of an alternative response team here in Knoxville as our biggest priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4522.08)|
| 1:15:28| Funding an alternative response team has for years been a community priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4528.08)|
| 1:15:31| After Ant was killed by KPD in his high school bathroom with no attempt to de-escalate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4531.08)|
| 1:15:37| to talk to him, to listen to him, to love him, to call his mama, to support him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4537.08)|
| 1:15:43| we asked if we would have to witness another preventable tragedy before our city was willing to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4543.08)|
| 1:15:48| With the preventable death of Lisa Edwards, we've now experienced the loss so many of us warned our city about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4548.08)|
| 1:15:53| At the hands of KPD, we've yet again lost someone who would still be with us, had an alternative response team existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4553.08)|
| 1:15:57| and responded with love and compassion to Ms. Lisa's pleas for help before she was taken from her family and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4557.08)|
| 1:16:05| Not only would funding an alternative response team prevent unnecessary death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4565.08)|
| 1:16:09| and minimize at-risk communities' contact with the legal system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4569.08)|
| 1:16:12| but it would also ensure that KPD is not forced to engage with people who just need support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4572.08)|
| 1:16:17| and that they acknowledge they are not trained or equipped to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4577.08)|
| 1:16:20| There is no question that an alternative response team should be established and funded in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4580.08)|
| 1:16:24| As we experience a housing crisis, a pandemic inflation, increasing desperation, addiction, and mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4584.08)|
| 1:16:31| there is a dire need for the compassion and care we have seen shown by alternative response teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4591.08)|
| 1:16:36| that have been established across this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4596.08)|
| 1:16:38| Houseless people and mentally ill people deserve bodily autonomy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4598.08)|
| 1:16:41| and forcibly displacing and incarcerating the poorest and most neglected members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4601.08)|
| 1:16:46| is a tragic injustice that has shocked many of us in Knoxville these past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4606.08)|
| 1:16:49| Our people, poor people, deserve support, love, and compassionate responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4609.08)|
| 1:16:54| rather than additional trauma and harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4614.08)|
| 1:16:57| Rather than rounding up and displacing and incarcerating our city's most vulnerable members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4617.08)|
| 1:17:01| those who suffer from severe mental illness, substance abuse disorders, and chronic poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4621.08)|
| 1:17:05| we must invest in supporting our houseless community and people suffering from these hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4625.08)|
| 1:17:10| to make sure that poverty does not continue to be a death sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4630.08)|
| 1:17:14| or cause for incarceration for people who have long been abandoned by our leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4634.08)|
| 1:17:17| One out of every three houseless men in this country is a veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4637.08)|
| 1:17:20| Twenty-two veterans commit suicide every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4640.08)|
| 1:17:23| most of whom are traumatized and suffering from PTSD and other mental illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4643.08)|
| 1:17:27| My dear friend and South Knoxvillian Josh Evans is among those veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4647.08)|
| 1:17:31| lost to suicide in a jail cell after a violent arrest during a mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4651.08)|
| 1:17:37| I think often about how he would still be with us if an alternative response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4657.08)|
| 1:17:41| had responded to his crisis with compassion and care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4661.08)|
| 1:17:43| rather than violently arresting him, jailing him, and ignoring him in his desperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4663.08)|
| 1:17:48| until they found his lifeless body in that jail cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4668.08)|
| 1:17:52| To our elected leaders, if it were your babies, your elders, your families, your mothers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4672.08)|
| 1:17:57| who were preventably killed, lost, humiliated, mocked as they breathed their final breaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4677.08)|
| 1:18:04| how far would you go to make sure that policies were put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4684.08)|
| 1:18:09| to make sure that such loss did not happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4689.08)|

| 1:18:17| Next person signed up to speak is Evora Kreis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4697.08)|
| 1:18:24| Hello, my name is Evora Kreis. I live in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4704.08)|
| 1:18:35| I'm here today in support of Resolution 11C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4715.08)|
| 1:18:39| for an alternative response team for mental health crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4719.08)|
| 1:18:43| For over a year and a half in 2021 and 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4723.08)|
| 1:18:49| I worked at the mobile crisis unit at Helen Ross McNabb as a transport and triage worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4729.08)|
| 1:18:56| When folks would call the crisis number for mental health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4736.08)|
| 1:19:02| in Knox County and surrounding counties, I was one of the people answering those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4742.08)|
| 1:19:07| My coworkers and I would always try to refer people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4747.08)|
| 1:19:12| to the least intrusive resources for care possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4752.08)|
| 1:19:15| but when someone was in danger to themselves or others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4755.08)|
| 1:19:19| due to suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or psychosis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4759.08)|
| 1:19:24| and the person would not get help voluntarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4764.08)|
| 1:19:28| the only resources we had to offer was a safety check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4768.08)|
| 1:19:32| which meant getting the police involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4772.08)|
| 1:19:34| In the best case, we could call co-response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4774.08)|
| 1:19:38| but unfortunately the team had very little capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4778.08)|
| 1:19:42| and of course involved officer response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4782.08)|
| 1:19:45| The response I heard from clients and loved ones was overwhelmingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4785.08)|
| 1:19:50| that they would prefer having a social worker respond to these crises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4790.08)|
| 1:19:54| but oftentimes people would decline getting the help they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4794.08)|
| 1:20:04| for them or their loved ones that they really needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4804.08)|
| 1:20:08| because of the potential presence of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4808.08)|
| 1:20:11| I heard from many folks that they were afraid for their safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4811.08)|
| 1:20:16| and had previous trauma surrounding police encounters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4816.08)|
| 1:20:20| Everyone deserves safety and care in a crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4820.08)|

| 1:20:27| and I and many others in our community want that for the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4827.08)|
| 1:20:34| As you can see from the beautiful people behind me wearing red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4834.08)|
| 1:20:39| many people support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4839.08)|
| 1:20:42| And in the interest of better client and community care in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4842.08)|
| 1:20:47| I urge you to pass the Resolution 11C for an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4847.08)|
| 1:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4852.08)|

| 1:20:58| Ms. Evry, you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4858.08)|
| 1:21:04| Constance Evry, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4864.08)|
| 1:21:13| Hey, Knoxville voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4873.08)|
| 1:21:16| So India needs to pass this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4876.08)|
| 1:21:19| because she has nothing to bring to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4879.08)|
| 1:21:22| for her four and a half years as the mayor of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4882.08)|
| 1:21:26| Let's also keep it realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4886.08)|
| 1:21:28| We have been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4888.08)|
| 1:21:30| This is a second attempt to bring HEART across the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4890.08)|
| 1:21:35| after you all rejected it three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4895.08)|
| 1:21:38| as someone highlighted, for this watered-down version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4898.08)|
| 1:21:41| called Responder Program instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4901.08)|
| 1:21:44| And now that that has literally blown up in your face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4904.08)|
| 1:21:46| by the data of success or, more importantly, failure rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4906.08)|
| 1:21:49| you are ready to now try something truly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4909.08)|
| 1:21:53| But give HEART the credit for their resiliency and determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4913.08)|
| 1:21:57| More importantly, the ability to change the key piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4917.08)|
| 1:22:02| which is an elected employee versus an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4922.08)|
| 1:22:06| Shout out to Amelia Parker for not letting this initiative go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4926.08)|
| 1:22:10| and still doing the due diligence work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4930.08)|
| 1:22:12| to bring it back to the table a second time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4932.08)|
| 1:22:15| You all have to pass this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4935.08)|
| 1:22:18| because we have already highlighted before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4938.08)|
| 1:22:21| Anthony Thompson, Jr. needed this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4941.08)|
| 1:22:24| Lisa Edwards needed this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4944.08)|
| 1:22:27| Sierra McCullough needed this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4947.08)|
| 1:22:30| than so many numerous others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4950.08)|
| 1:22:33| And so we cannot continue to sit back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4953.08)|
| 1:22:36| and funnel money into our police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4956.08)|
| 1:22:38| that we have spent more time giving militarization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4958.08)|
| 1:22:42| and surplus equipment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4962.08)|
| 1:22:44| versus actually addressing the cultural issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4964.08)|
| 1:22:46| within the department itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4966.08)|
| 1:22:48| So, again, voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4968.08)|
| 1:22:50| if they do not give you what you need tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4970.08)|
| 1:22:53| then you leverage the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4973.08)|
| 1:22:54| And vote India and the rest of the administration up out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4974.08)|
| 1:22:58| You have the power. You have the say-so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4978.08)|
| 1:23:01| Exercise your authority. Exercise your leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4981.08)|
| 1:23:04| And more importantly, vote India up out of here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4984.08)|
| 1:23:07| because she continues to show who she truly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4987.08)|
| 1:23:10| I cannot say it enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4990.08)|
| 1:23:12| If you are not voting for Constance Everett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4992.08)|
| 1:23:14| then you are not serious about change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4994.08)|
| 1:23:16| If you are not voting for Constance Everett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4996.08)|
| 1:23:18| then you are not serious about HEART.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4998.08)|
| 1:23:20| If you are not voting for Constance Everett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5000.08)|
| 1:23:21| then you are not serious about the KPD Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5001.08)|
| 1:23:24| and the necessary changes that must come through once for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5004.08)|
| 1:23:28| Again, Knoxville, we need this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5008.08)|
| 1:23:31| And if they don't give it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5011.08)|
| 1:23:33| then you use your ultimate power as a voter and as a taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5013.08)|
| 1:23:36| and you put these people out of office once and for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5016.08)|
| 1:23:40| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5020.08)|
| 1:23:41| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5021.08)|
| 1:23:46| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak to Item 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5026.08)|

| 1:28:17| conversations with members of the community about this topic, and I'm quite excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5297.4800000000005)|

| 1:30:23| level. But there may be a possibility for council to approve this resolution and commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5423.12)|
| 1:30:31| to forming a task force. So if you all would be open to it, I would love to hear where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5431.0)|
| 1:30:36| everyone is at with this resolution and your suggestion of whether you're ready to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5436.88)|
| 1:30:41| tonight or if you need more time. That's what I propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5441.96)|
| 1:30:52| Councilmember Singh? I'll go. I think it's time for this, guys. We've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5452.72)|
| 1:30:57| it for a really long time. The volunteers that have been involved in this for three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5457.4400000000005)|
| 1:31:03| years, they put a lot of time and energy. They're not getting paid. They're doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5463.4800000000005)|
| 1:31:08| for the community. We've had a lot of instances where an alternative response team would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5468.080000000001)|
| 1:31:15| been appropriate. I agree with one of the speakers. This is pro-police. We ask our police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5475.4400000000005)|
| 1:31:21| to do a ridiculous amount of social work. That is not their job. I do not think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5481.52)|
| 1:31:29| to workshop on this anymore. I do not think we need to wait until the county and the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5489.4800000000005)|
| 1:31:38| department and everybody else gets involved. I think this is our responsibility. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5498.0)|
| 1:31:44| something that all over the country is happening. It's not brand new. And I'm surprised that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5504.0)|
| 1:31:50| we have any resistance. I understand that there is not a group who has, like McNab Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5510.84)|
| 1:31:56| stood up to do the co-response model. And we don't have that right now for an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5516.68)|
| 1:32:03| response. But we need to create that. Right? We created Turn Up Knox when we were missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5523.76)|
| 1:32:09| when there was a gap that needed to be filled. I think the $50,000 is a very small amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5529.200000000001)|
| 1:32:16| to start moving forward on this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5536.88)|
| 1:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5540.28)|
| 1:32:23| Thank you, Mayor. I'm very supportive of considering this addition of alternative response to further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5543.88)|
| 1:32:32| complement our efforts that we've been doing about responding in instances where a police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5552.64)|
| 1:32:37| response and police presence may not be necessary. So I'm very supportive of all the work that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5557.68)|
| 1:32:42| going on. For those in the room, I know Council knows this, but two years ago at our Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5562.28)|
| 1:32:48| retreat Council asked to have a joint mental health care workshop with our county and state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5568.32)|
| 1:32:54| partners and we did that. And so about a year ago we had that and since then I've continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5574.08)|
| 1:32:59| that discussion and actually been continuing discussing alternative response teams with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5579.5599999999995)|
| 1:33:04| the providers that we have in the community. I've also asked for a review of gaps in services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5584.08)|
| 1:33:10| that an alternative response team could fill. To the question of this resolution today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5590.64)|
| 1:33:18| I don't support the language that's written because I'm not sure that $50,000 is the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5598.68)|
| 1:33:25| number. And in my experience knowing how we've had some successful task force in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5605.6)|
| 1:33:33| they can sometimes get things done. The most recent example is the sign ordinance task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5613.96)|
| 1:33:38| force. They met for three years before they brought something to Council. And I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5618.400000000001)|
| 1:33:42| with what everyone said. This is so important. It's not something that needs to just go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5622.72)|
| 1:33:47| a committee. It's something that we need to work on. So that's why I don't support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5627.080000000001)|
| 1:33:50| task force at this time. I do have some questions though. Deputy to the Mayor Gill, has city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5630.84)|

| 1:34:04| the Mayor and Chief Policy Officer. Yes, we really in response to many of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5644.400000000001)|
| 1:34:09| comments that some of you made when we were on Zoom back in 2020, our team and Ms. Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5649.88)|
| 1:34:16| was part of this as well, began to look at alternative response. And we looked at case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5656.080000000001)|
| 1:34:20| studies. We looked at third party research. We spoke with local providers, potential partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5660.080000000001)|
| 1:34:24| And we also had conference calls with some of the cities that are successfully implementing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5664.76)|
| 1:34:29| these programs. So we did, if you recall, present some of those findings in a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5669.16)|
| 1:34:35| in June of 2021. And really as a result of some of that dialogue, contracted with McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5675.12)|
| 1:34:42| to provide a workshop for sequential intercept mapping that many partners in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5682.4)|
| 1:34:48| participated in. And alternative response was considered as part of that sequential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5688.08)|
| 1:34:51| intercept mapping process. And in your review of alternative response teams, has this approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5691.639999999999)|
| 1:34:58| shown promise in other communities? Yes, it has. And I would say that, you know, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5698.12)|
| 1:35:04| folks have articulated both in meetings and you've heard our team say in conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5704.76)|
| 1:35:10| about this, we do think that they have shown progress, or excuse me, promise and could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5710.5199999999995)|
| 1:35:15| in theory work in Knoxville. We see that as a potential to explore. Okay. Now the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5715.4)|
| 1:35:21| doesn't have a health department and we don't have specific expertise in mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5721.84)|
| 1:35:26| Is this something that could work in Knoxville if we found a local partner who's willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5726.68)|
| 1:35:31| to operate it? We think that local partner would be absolutely critical. And in looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5731.56)|
| 1:35:40| at these kinds of programs that you've looked at, what are the more successful ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5740.320000000001)|
| 1:35:45| you've seen? So I'll hit on some of the themes that we've seen to make them successful. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5745.72)|
| 1:35:51| first is really a foundation of cross-jurisdictional partnership. So it's not just a city acting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5751.76)|
| 1:35:58| unilaterally but having strong partnership, including funding from multiple sources that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5758.400000000001)|
| 1:36:03| includes county, state, federal, kind of all the way up the chain, as well as philanthropic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5763.320000000001)|
| 1:36:08| We've also seen that they're complex, so they require really extensive coordination to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5768.4800000000005)|
| 1:36:12| those highly complex logistical systems to make something like this successful. And one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5772.2)|
| 1:36:18| point is that they also require significant new funding, so it's not necessarily realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5778.0)|
| 1:36:22| that they are offset by savings elsewhere. Okay. And so is there a benefit to having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5782.84)|
| 1:36:30| a cross-jurisdictional approach where you've got the city, the county, and the state all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5790.68)|
| 1:36:36| at once working on something like this? I think particularly because it is so predicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5796.12)|
| 1:36:41| on mental health as the key focus of the service, then yes, it would absolutely in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5801.32)|
| 1:36:49| Knoxville require that type of cross-jurisdictional partnership to be successful. Okay. And what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5809.16)|
| 1:36:54| I would pose to council as well, and I have brought this up with our planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5814.24)|
| 1:37:00| chair, is maybe we should reconvene the joint mental health care workshop and we can discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5820.599999999999)|
| 1:37:07| those gaps and potentially this as well. So I just wanted to put that out there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5827.2)|
| 1:37:11| we could do that today. We could think about that going forward. And then, Mayor, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5831.639999999999)|
| 1:37:16| my last question. You know, this is asking for $50,000. Would you support and bring a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5836.04)|
| 1:37:23| budget amendment if a partner could be found that could stand up this type of a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5843.88)|
| 1:37:30| and funding from other partners was located? Yes, absolutely. I think that would be a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5850.0)|
| 1:37:34| positive step forward, but I think those other partners are essential. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5854.400000000001)|
| 1:37:40| Council Member Testerman? Thank you. I just have a question. I don't know who is equipped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5860.72)|
| 1:37:50| to answer this, Council Member Parker or someone else, but I'm just curious, after having looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5870.72)|
| 1:37:56| at different models across the country, and we have heard about it for a long time, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5876.120000000001)|
| 1:38:02| just curious what analysis has been done that, you know, looking at Knoxville, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5882.68)|
| 1:38:11| know if call volume, those types of things have been considered, but how much this startup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5891.360000000001)|
| 1:38:17| would cost, how many individuals would you anticipate would also need to be hired to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5897.96)|
| 1:38:24| form an effective alternative response team? For starters, I mean, that's my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5904.64)|
| 1:38:33| Yes, I would say that initial work has been conducted in multiple spaces to different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5913.64)|
| 1:38:41| degrees. As far as the Knoxville Heart Group, they have a proposal for an initial startup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5921.76)|
| 1:38:50| that would require the purchase of a new vehicle, hiring three staff people to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5930.4400000000005)|
| 1:38:58| up the program. I think the budget is close to $400,000, around $350,000 would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5938.240000000001)|
| 1:39:05| startup cost for a pilot program. You know, I just go back to our current co-responder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5945.040000000001)|

| 1:39:23| you know, I know that that's nowhere close to it being fully functional. I mean, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5963.240000000001)|
| 1:39:27| probably take 18 to 24 individuals to be able to fully staff all shifts throughout the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5967.360000000001)|
| 1:39:37| and the cost associated with that would be pretty costly. And then my concern in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5977.64)|
| 1:39:47| model, the fact that nurses are a part of this equation, knowing how healthcare is struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5987.6)|

| 1:40:13| honest, I mean, our ambulance system right now is incredibly broken. I mean, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6013.360000000001)|
| 1:40:17| four-hour response times, seven-hour response times, eight-hour response times. So, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6017.96)|
| 1:40:23| know, we have so many broken pieces already that this program would be dependent on, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6023.4400000000005)|
| 1:40:30| I just am, you know, would even be concerned on how that staffing would even be possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6030.92)|
| 1:40:37| at this point, not to mention the cost that would need to be allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6037.88)|
| 1:40:43| Can I make one clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6043.4800000000005)|
| 1:40:47| Okay, yeah, or please be quiet in the audience. This is a discussion among council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6047.4800000000005)|
| 1:40:55| Council Member Tesserman, did you have anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6055.52)|
| 1:40:59| I'll let Council Member Parker respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6059.12)|
| 1:41:01| Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6061.12)|
| 1:41:02| I just wanted to offer one clarification. I've actually met with multiple EMTs who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6062.12)|
| 1:41:09| in support of this program. I almost said super support, but I'm trying to be professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6069.5199999999995)|
| 1:41:14| in support of this program. And part of the reason is because of the state of our ambulatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6074.24)|
| 1:41:24| care and emergency room capacity. They see this as something that would relieve the workload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6084.24)|

| 1:41:45| solution. But I just wanted to clarify that those are pieces that hopefully this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6105.8)|
| 1:41:52| would relieve some of the work, rather than needing them to be a part of the equation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6112.88)|
| 1:41:59| in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6119.400000000001)|
| 1:42:02| Thank you. Council Member McKenzie, and then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6122.28)|
| 1:42:06| Thank you, Mayor. So I want to first say that I am not opposed whatsoever to alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6126.72)|
| 1:42:13| response teams. But if we're going to do it, we have got to take a lot of things into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6133.4800000000005)|
| 1:42:20| One, for example, when we talk about ERs and how understaffed they are and overpopulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6140.88)|
| 1:42:28| When you walk in UT hospital emergency room most nights, it looks like a third world country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6148.32)|
| 1:42:35| Some nights in there, there are people who are literally sitting in the lobby who need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6155.56)|
| 1:42:41| to be back being cared for, and they're out there with IVs and all types of things. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6161.04)|
| 1:42:46| not a good level of care, if you will. But when we talk about alternative response teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6166.360000000001)|
| 1:42:55| when we have someone who is suicidal or homicidal ideation, someone who is high on drugs, nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6175.320000000001)|

| 1:43:05| this for a very long time. And a lot of times it is to the point where they can no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6185.320000000001)|
| 1:43:10| handle it. There's aggressiveness. They are afraid. There is some violence toward family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6190.6)|
| 1:43:16| members. And so I'll go back to the joint workshop that we had, if any of you guys watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6196.4800000000005)|
| 1:43:24| that or you were here for that. And to be honest with you, there is no way that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6204.160000000001)|
| 1:43:29| going to be successful because we all know, those of you who are sitting in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6209.64)|
| 1:43:33| the treatment options are very limited. There are waiting lists that are ridiculous for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6213.84)|
| 1:43:40| people to get help. So even when we go out on a call, even when you go out on a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6220.24)|
| 1:43:46| where are you going to put the person? The most disgusting thing that I heard in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6226.08)|
| 1:43:50| joint workshop, and it was a true fact, from the Knox County Jail system, it was Randy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6230.639999999999)|
| 1:43:56| Nichols who said, Knox County Jail is the mental health facility for people in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6236.24)|
| 1:44:03| and the county. And that's horrendous because that is not where they belong. That is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6243.88)|
| 1:44:10| where they belong. But there are no treatment options that are available for some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6250.04)|
| 1:44:15| who are in those levels of crisis once they are medically stabilized. And that is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6255.24)|
| 1:44:21| they, and that's where they end up, if they're medically stable. That is not the place for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6261.0)|
| 1:44:27| them. So a joint venture needs to look like city, county, and the state. It has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6267.04)|
| 1:44:34| to be sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6274.64)|
| 1:44:35| Please be quiet. We can't hear Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6275.64)|
| 1:44:39| Again, for it to be sustainable, it has to be a joint venture on all levels of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6279.64)|
| 1:44:47| bodies. We need the state stepping up to be able to invest more dollars into putting state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6287.56)|
| 1:44:55| level mental health and substance abuse facilities back into our city. Again, I'm speaking. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6295.0)|
| 1:45:03| at this point, when we're talking about a task force, when we're talking about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6303.6)|
| 1:45:08| of this nature, all of those entities have to be at the table. There is no way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6308.320000000001)|
| 1:45:13| it. All of these entities have to be at the table. That's Helen Ross McNabb, that's Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6313.360000000001)|
| 1:45:19| that's everybody. So again, and I'm speaking. If you want to have a conversation after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6319.160000000001)|
| 1:45:25| meeting, I'll be happy to speak with you. But again, in order for us to be able to deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6325.200000000001)|
| 1:45:31| the type of services to meet the needs of the people who are living in our city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6331.08)|
| 1:45:35| our county, this is so much bigger than just the city. And if we're going to do it, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6335.44)|
| 1:45:41| need to do it right. And so that's my position on it, not opposed to it, but we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6341.8)|
| 1:45:47| to have to have everybody at the table. And again, when I say joint venture, we cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6347.5599999999995)|
| 1:45:52| just continue to look to the city. The city cannot do it alone. We don't have the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6352.76)|
| 1:45:57| as it relates to the mental health facilities, the substance abuse facilities. There's so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6357.52)|
| 1:46:02| much dual diagnosis that's going on as it relates to some of these issues that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6362.080000000001)|
| 1:46:06| talking about. And so I appreciate the work that HART has been doing, but there is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6366.200000000001)|
| 1:46:14| much more support that will be needed outside of the city to make this successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6374.120000000001)|
| 1:46:21| Thank you, Councilmember McKenzie. Councilmember Ryder. Members of the audience, please do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6381.0)|
| 1:46:25| not interrupt City Council. This is their time to have a discussion. Thank you. Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6385.84)|
| 1:46:30| Ryder. Yeah. So Councilwoman Parker specifically asked for this time for us to have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6390.52)|
| 1:46:38| so I appreciate that. When I spoke with a member from HART, my reservation was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6398.08)|
| 1:46:44| the $500,000 that was in the resolution. The number that actually made it to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6404.72)|
| 1:46:52| is a different number. So my questions to Ms. Riffwald, I believe, were what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6412.52)|
| 1:47:00| $500,000? Like what is the budget? There was no budget to that, and so that was the hesitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6420.56)|
| 1:47:07| I don't think that any of us are opposed to have an alternative response. I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6427.76)|
| 1:47:13| struggle is that we started, and many of you have been in it for the long haul, we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6433.040000000001)|
| 1:47:17| with the co-responder model because the social workers that were willing to step up in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6437.92)|
| 1:47:24| staffing program said that their staff didn't want to go out without backup in the instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6444.36)|
| 1:47:32| when things might go a different direction. And the struggle that we have right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6452.36)|
| 1:47:37| not that that model is failing. It's not a someone said not a one size fits all. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6457.76)|
| 1:47:42| not a one size fits all. Some cities have both models, is that those positions are vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6462.96)|
| 1:47:49| and Helen Ross McNabb has many vacant positions as well. I just think it's important to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6469.52)|
| 1:47:55| that many of us in the room, though we think we don't agree with each other, we do. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6475.92)|
| 1:48:01| are in a state that has not taken the Medicaid expansion, and we have a collapsing healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6481.12)|
| 1:48:08| system, and cities like Knoxville and Nashville and Memphis and Chattanooga that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6488.360000000001)|
| 1:48:14| still have hospitals, unlike the many places that don't have hospitals or ERs, we're collapsing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6494.080000000001)|
| 1:48:22| because we're bearing the brunt of all the places that don't. And we have a lot of caregivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6502.120000000001)|
| 1:48:26| that don't want to be in this state anymore. Let's be honest. Why would they? It's made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6506.920000000001)|
| 1:48:33| People have made it unpalatable to be here if you're a caregiver. And so that's cascading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6513.24)|
| 1:48:38| and making things that weren't great, worse. So I'm not opposed to having a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6518.48)|
| 1:48:45| I have a question for Ms. Gill. So we're doing the joint state county city funded. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6525.88)|
| 1:48:56| sure what we're calling it in the in the empath empath. What does that stand for at St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6536.32)|
| 1:49:03| is what you're talking about. Yeah. What are you calling it? Empath? Okay. And so what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6543.0)|
| 1:49:09| exactly are we going to be doing there? And is that expansion and some of that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6549.44)|
| 1:49:17| and or something that could be added upon to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6557.32)|
| 1:49:22| Miss Councilman Ryder, I'll give a review from from my understanding and ask my deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6562.48)|
| 1:49:27| to expand if for anything I may leave out. But basically, this is a good example of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6567.52)|
| 1:49:32| the city can contribute to mental health. We own a building at the corner of St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6572.6)|
| 1:49:36| that used to be the Women's Outpatient Surgical Center. Is that right? Or some outpatient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6576.72)|
| 1:49:41| surgery and it's vacant. So we own it. We have a building. We have needs in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6581.280000000001)|
| 1:49:47| So we went to the state. We met with the governor. We went with Mayor Jacobs. We explained the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6587.200000000001)|
| 1:49:53| need that we need more mental health, inpatient care and short term care. And what we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6593.360000000001)|
| 1:50:00| offer is a building and money to commit to renovate that building for the new need. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6600.08)|
| 1:50:05| the county said they would agree to help us with the renovation costs. So there's money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6605.76)|
| 1:50:10| and real estate from the city. And what the state agreed to do, along with the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6610.68)|
| 1:50:17| and McNabb, is for the hospitals to staff an urgent care clinic in one part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6617.08)|
| 1:50:22| And then another part of the building is going to be, I think, 17 short term beds for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6622.88)|
| 1:50:29| in a mental health crisis, up to three days. So there would be a physical health clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6629.4400000000005)|
| 1:50:35| in one portion of the building for the general public, for strep throat, sprained ankles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6635.84)|
| 1:50:41| or to get medically cleared to get admitted to the behavioral health unit. So basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6641.6)|
| 1:50:45| it's short term beds, I think 17, and that will be funded. And this is important for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6645.960000000001)|
| 1:50:53| council. You know, mental health care is expensive and staffing it is expensive. McNabb will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6653.6)|
| 1:50:58| staff it, and it will be funded in part through hospitals and TennCare, I believe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6658.24)|
| 1:51:04| the staffing. Mr. Brace, can you elaborate on things I might have left out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6664.48)|
| 1:51:08| No, I think what's important about that is that was an initiative pushed by the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6668.96)|
| 1:51:13| big health care systems, University of Tennessee, Tenova, and Covenant, specifically Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6673.5599999999995)|
| 1:51:19| which sees significant amounts of indigent care. And so we came to the table to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6679.5199999999995)|
| 1:51:25| this initiative through the health care systems and McNabb, and again, provided the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6685.32)|
| 1:51:30| some initial capital, along with the county, and then the funding will come primarily from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6690.44)|
| 1:51:34| the state, and some, I believe, indigent care from Knox County. But again, that took three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6694.5599999999995)|
| 1:51:40| years of work, and again, we were at the table to help with that, but the leaders were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6700.599999999999)|
| 1:51:45| health care systems and McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6705.4)|
| 1:51:48| Okay. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6708.64)|
| 1:51:53| Thank you, Mayor. There have been a lot of concerns and issues raised, legitimate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6713.64)|
| 1:51:59| good ones, and we've talked about what resources we don't have. I think these are all the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6719.64)|
| 1:52:08| that the task force would be working on as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6728.64)|
| 1:52:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6732.64)|
| 1:52:21| As a council, that is, most of us, that is not our skill set, and I don't think we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6741.64)|
| 1:52:27| into other programs to this extent to review them. The objection or the hesitation some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6747.64)|
| 1:52:35| folks have on the task force, we created the African American Equity Restoration Task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6755.64)|
| 1:52:41| Force, and I believe that was funded $150,000, and I believe that it was necessary, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6761.64)|
| 1:52:47| doing good work, but this is an example we've used before, and it's moving forward, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6767.64)|
| 1:52:53| yeah. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6773.64)|
| 1:52:56| Thank you. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6776.64)|
| 1:53:00| Thank you, Mayor. I wanted to share a quick story about my trip to Denver. I was able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6780.64)|
| 1:53:10| to meet with Denver Star, their alternative response program, and you know, you're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6790.64)|
| 1:53:16| Denver, you've got this great public transit, you're looking around, and you know they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6796.64)|
| 1:53:21| more resources than Knoxville does. So top of mind for me was, I asked them, if you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6801.64)|
| 1:53:30| if you did not have the services in your city that you currently have, and you weren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6810.64)|
| 1:53:36| you didn't have as many options to take someone to a service provider, if you didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6816.64)|
| 1:53:42| expanded Medicaid, would this program still be beneficial? Would you still recommend a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6822.64)|
| 1:53:49| city like Knoxville implement a program like alternative response? And they emphatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6829.64)|
| 1:53:55| said yes, and they gave specific reasons why, and examples, and a lot of the times, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6835.64)|
| 1:54:02| because they can treat someone, stabilize someone, right there where they need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6842.64)|
| 1:54:09| They don't have to take them somewhere, they don't have to use the emergency rooms, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6849.64)|
| 1:54:16| actually frees up space in our emergency rooms because there's this alternative option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6856.64)|
| 1:54:21| But they emphatically said yes, because of the experiences that they've been having since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6861.64)|
| 1:54:27| their program was started. Another set of phone calls that they get, that they're able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6867.64)|
| 1:54:32| to respond to, are folks, you know, experiencing a low level of mental health crisis where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6872.64)|
| 1:54:40| they're living in a more isolated situation, they just don't have anyone to turn to, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6880.64)|
| 1:54:47| would call Denver Star, who could come and, you know, talk to them through whatever, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6887.64)|
| 1:54:56| know, small crisis, it doesn't have to be a major crisis, it can even be a small mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6896.64)|
| 1:55:00| health crisis that Denver Star shows up for, and they were able to respond in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6900.64)|
| 1:55:09| particularly during the pandemic when folks were in isolation. We still have folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6909.64)|
| 1:55:15| are living somewhat in isolation, if they have fragile, you know, medical situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6915.64)|
| 1:55:23| they're still susceptible to COVID and other diseases out there. So I still see that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6923.64)|
| 1:55:30| a need in that situation, as well as these situations where they're able to treat folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6930.64)|
| 1:55:37| in the field. The other thing I wanted to say is, I agree that this has to include as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6937.64)|
| 1:55:45| many partners as possible and all levels of government as possible. I would love the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6945.64)|
| 1:55:50| government to be a part of this task force. But to get the state involved, you know, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6950.64)|
| 1:55:57| not going to be Knoxville Heart that pulls them in, it's not going to be Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6957.64)|
| 1:56:01| Parker who pulls them in. We really need the support of the administration to pull the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6961.64)|
| 1:56:06| state into these conversations. And so, you know, the purpose of the task force is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6966.64)|
| 1:56:13| an initial step for us to say, the city of Knoxville is interested, the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6973.64)|
| 1:56:20| sees this as a need. We do not believe we can do this alone. We believe that we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6980.64)|
| 1:56:26| need partners in different levels of government, we will need partners in nonprofits, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6986.64)|
| 1:56:33| private sector. But the task force provides the space for us to pull people into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6993.64)|
| 1:56:41| conversation and see what results from it. I also hear concerns about the eight-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7001.64)|
| 1:56:49| timeline and how long other task forces have taken to produce a proposal. I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7009.64)|
| 1:56:58| we can extend that. I think it's helpful to set an expectation. This was set by the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7018.64)|
| 1:57:06| of the timeline that they wanted to work within to show what their level of commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7026.64)|
| 1:57:11| was, what future members of the task force, what level of commitment we need from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7031.64)|
| 1:57:17| so that we can really engage in a high level of work for several months to bring back a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7037.64)|
| 1:57:27| proposal. But if more time is needed, that can come back before Council to consider an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7047.64)|
| 1:57:33| extension, additional funding, but hopefully work could be accomplished and this could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7053.64)|
| 1:57:40| move us forward in the amount of time described in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7060.64)|
| 1:57:47| Thank you. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7067.64)|
| 1:57:52| Yeah, so my question a while ago to the administration wasn't precisely exactly what empath was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7072.64)|
| 1:57:59| it was, so the question here is who houses the alternative response team? And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7079.64)|
| 1:58:06| the question that Hart has been asking. And the response is collectively KPD is not where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7086.64)|
| 1:58:14| it belongs, or, you know, an alternative response. So my question is, is the alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7094.64)|
| 1:58:22| team, is that something that can be housed with the empath offered and managed through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7102.64)|
| 1:58:31| Helen Ross McNabb? That is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7111.64)|
| 1:58:33| I would just say that McNabb has been part of these discussions for several years, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7113.64)|
| 1:58:38| they say they want to focus on co-responder and the many other things they're doing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7118.64)|
| 1:58:42| mental health, and they are not ready to embark on an alternative response. So, and they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7122.64)|
| 1:58:48| the ones, there was one of the speakers who talked about, you know, the mobile crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7128.64)|
| 1:58:53| service. They are our mobile crisis service through the mental health department. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7133.64)|
| 1:58:58| a state of Tennessee mental health department, and here's, you know, it says that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7138.64)|
| 1:59:03| a 24-7, 365 response team for those who are experiencing a mental health emergency. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7143.64)|
| 1:59:09| then they say the services are for children and youth, adults, you know, across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7149.64)|
| 1:59:15| And the problem is, and we all know this, is that it's not enough, and they need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7155.64)|
| 1:59:20| you know, do a better job providing those services in person, not just on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7160.64)|
| 1:59:25| and not just during business hours and so forth. So, again, I think that this is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7165.64)|
| 1:59:30| important. I think the city can play a role, but just like empath, which we started, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7170.64)|
| 1:59:35| know, empath and the BHUC and street outreach workers, all these things that the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7175.64)|
| 1:59:41| has pushed for and supported that we did, you know, we didn't, we moved forward on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7181.64)|
| 1:59:46| just as a council, because we heard input from the community, they didn't need a task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7186.64)|
| 1:59:51| force. And so, so these, this is the state responsibility, and we, I agree with Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7191.64)|
| 1:59:58| McKenzie and others who said that, you know, we should definitely play a role in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7198.64)|
| 2:00:03| but it can't be something that we are starting like our own city mental health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7203.64)|
| 2:00:07| I think that that's not, that's outside our purview, it's outside our budget, it's outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7207.64)|
| 2:00:12| our area of expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7212.64)|
| 2:00:14| To fund a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7214.64)|
| 2:00:20| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7220.64)|
| 2:00:23| Thank you again. I don't think anyone's talking about funding an entire mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7223.64)|
| 2:00:28| department right now. And, Lauren, I think you asked some really good questions. Once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7228.64)|
| 2:00:35| again, I think those are things that the task force needs to look at. I don't, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7235.64)|
| 2:00:41| have much hope that the state of Tennessee is going to come out here or the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7241.64)|

| 2:00:50| think that they are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7250.64)|
| 2:00:54| If we don't, if we don't do this, what are we going to do? Right? I'm still very sore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7254.64)|
| 2:01:02| about two weeks ago when the recovery community lost out on $5.5 million. And then now today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7262.64)|
| 2:01:09| we're talking about not helping other people who are in crisis. And I'm just really disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7269.64)|
| 2:01:17| that we're not moving forward somehow. I do not want to sit here and go, yeah, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7277.64)|
| 2:01:22| a great idea. Let's wait for other people to come in and do this. And then three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7282.64)|
| 2:01:26| later, we're having the same conversation. So what, what are we going to do if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7286.64)|
| 2:01:31| do this? What's our next move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7291.64)|
| 2:01:35| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7295.64)|
| 2:01:36| Um, I agree with Council Member Singh and, um, and worried that, um, that, that, that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7296.64)|
| 2:01:58| um, we're not, we're, we're, we're struggling to see the benefit of something that, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7318.64)|
| 2:02:04| many of us feel is a reasonable next step in this conversation. Um, I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7324.64)|
| 2:02:12| the task force is the space for us to explore these questions and council meetings have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7332.64)|
| 2:02:18| not been adequate. Um, workshops have not really been adequate. Oftentimes workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7338.64)|
| 2:02:23| are an opportunity for information to be shared with us, but, um, we don't have as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7343.64)|
| 2:02:28| much opportunity to have discussions like we're having right now and like a, a task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7348.64)|
| 2:02:33| force would engage in. Um, we definitely heard from Helen Ross McNabb that they are, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7353.64)|
| 2:02:42| you know, interested in the co-responder model, not necessarily housing an alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7362.64)|
| 2:02:47| program. Um, and so I think that is another reason why the task force is needed so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7367.64)|
| 2:02:55| these mental health care professionals from other agencies have an opportunity to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7375.64)|
| 2:03:01| develop a plan, um, that, that, that expands what our capacity is as a city beyond what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7381.64)|
| 2:03:09| Helen Ross McNabb is able to provide. Completely understandable if, um, they want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7389.64)|
| 2:03:16| limit their, their services. Absolutely. Completely understandable. But, but what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7396.64)|
| 2:03:24| not okay for me is that we say this is the state's responsibility and we continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7404.64)|
| 2:03:31| send police to situations. We are obviously taking on the responsibility if we are sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7411.64)|
| 2:03:40| police. Uh, we're not going to step back and say, hey, state, send some police to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7420.64)|
| 2:03:46| issue. You know, we're the city, we don't deal with mental health. We're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7426.64)|
| 2:03:51| let that happen. We have a duty to our citizens to ensure public health and safety in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7431.64)|
| 2:03:58| city. And so whether the state provides the funding, whether the state provides leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7438.64)|
| 2:04:04| on this issue or not, the problems fall back to us. And so we have to have a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7444.64)|
| 2:04:10| And to do nothing means that we're just going to do the same thing, which our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7450.64)|
| 2:04:15| is telling us is causing harm. Um, I, I really hope that, uh, um, you know, we're able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7455.64)|
| 2:04:27| find a, a solution that we're able to move forward. And if that means, you know, a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7467.64)|
| 2:04:33| edits to the resolution, please, uh, let us know because this is the, this is our space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7473.64)|
| 2:04:39| to have some debate and negotiation and see if we can come up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7479.64)|
| 2:04:46| Council Member Testeron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7486.64)|
| 2:04:48| Thank you. Um, so I'm just curious if, let's say the task force is formed. Um, help me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7488.64)|
| 2:04:57| understand what that looks like, the structure of it. You know, how many members are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7497.64)|
| 2:05:03| Who's going to oversee scheduling meetings? Um, you know, noticing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7503.64)|
| 2:05:09| Hey, please do not interrupt the discussion of council. You'll be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7509.64)|
| 2:05:14| Hey, order. If you cannot keep silent during council's discussion, you'll be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7514.64)|
| 2:05:22| Does, does everyone understand? If you cannot keep silent and let council do, conduct their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7522.64)|
| 2:05:29| business without interruption, you will be asked to leave. Council Member Testeron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7529.64)|
| 2:05:34| So I'm asking a legit question. If you've got a task force that's formed, um, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7534.64)|
| 2:05:40| it's a committee, a board, task force, whatever, it's got to have structure. So I'm just curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7540.64)|
| 2:05:45| what's been thought out, um, where that's concerned. Um, again, how many members, scheduling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7545.64)|
| 2:05:52| keeping minutes, sunshine notices, all of those things. Um, you know, I just go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7552.64)|
| 2:06:01| to, um, you know, a business plan of some kind of the task force, but also the model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7561.64)|
| 2:06:08| for an alternative response team, um, you know, who oversees it. We've talked a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7568.64)|
| 2:06:13| lot about Helen Ross tonight and nobody's here representing them to, um, be a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7573.64)|
| 2:06:19| this conversation. So I, these are all just questions that I have. It's, it's like starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7579.64)|
| 2:06:25| any operation, any business, um, to better understand, um, the confines of what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7585.64)|
| 2:06:31| looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7591.64)|
| 2:06:33| No, happy to answer. Um, the resolution is written in a way where the task force would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7593.64)|
| 2:06:38| be formed two months from now if passed today. And so that would give us two months to, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7598.64)|
| 2:06:47| finalize all of those details. I would, you know, commit to engaging in the process, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7607.64)|
| 2:06:54| similar to what we've seen over the last few days where, you know, leaders in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7614.64)|
| 2:06:59| who are leading on this issue are in touch with council members to, uh, gauge your input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7619.64)|
| 2:07:05| uh, solicit your input on what that makeup of the task force should look like and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7625.64)|
| 2:07:11| you would support because the makeup of the task force would come right back before city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7631.64)|
| 2:07:15| council for approval. Um, I have meetings with the administration to get the administration's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7635.64)|
| 2:07:21| input on, on members for that task force, but that would be work to be conducted after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7641.64)|
| 2:07:27| this resolution passes over the next two months before it comes back to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7647.64)|
| 2:07:34| Thank you for that. Um, I just, you know, again, going into something of this magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7654.64)|
| 2:07:40| and having some of those things already thought out and fleshed out, um, as to what it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7660.64)|
| 2:07:46| like, just even a rough draft, if you will. I mean, I think that's, um, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7666.64)|
| 2:07:55| idea, but I guess I'm just looking for more details on, on what's been thought through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7675.64)|
| 2:08:02| Well, and just quickly, I guess the rough draft would be the description in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7682.64)|
| 2:08:08| um, you know, that states the type of members that we envision would be a part of the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7688.64)|
| 2:08:16| force, uh, what, what demographic they're representing, um, uh, and that's on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7696.64)|
| 2:08:26| 594, um, that describes a bit of that demographic that we would expect to be represented on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7706.64)|
| 2:08:35| the task force. So that's a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7715.64)|
| 2:08:39| I'm sorry. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7719.64)|
| 2:08:48| Thank you, Mayor. I've tried to spend a lot of time on the phone with folks from HART,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7728.64)|
| 2:08:53| people at McNab and members of the administration. So I just want to reflect a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7733.64)|
| 2:08:58| what I've heard. Um, I want to, first of all, thank HART for bringing this model to, to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7738.64)|
| 2:09:05| to me years ago, and, um, you all brought educated, rational, programmatic ideas for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7745.64)|
| 2:09:13| this program. And I think what I've witnessed is over the course of a couple of years, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7753.64)|
| 2:09:18| moved from a little uncertainty to general consensus that this program needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7758.64)|
| 2:09:25| I've also heard that funding's not an issue, uh, in terms of next steps. So while it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7765.64)|
| 2:09:35| cost, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars to stand up, there's not a funding gap for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7775.64)|
| 2:09:40| researching or meeting with HART, McNab and the administration. So in my opinion, council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7780.64)|
| 2:09:50| was not needed to take the next step. Um, we don't need to be involved and necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7790.64)|
| 2:09:55| read ourselves into the play. We have, McNab has been doing this for two years. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7795.64)|
| 2:10:00| learned a lot. HART has not stopped researching what they found. What I've also heard is somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7800.64)|
| 2:10:07| in there, there's a, there's a, there's a people problem where people are either being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7807.64)|
| 2:10:11| welcomed to the table or aren't talking to one another or being heard or listening well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7811.64)|
| 2:10:17| So, uh, somewhere in there, there's a break in communication between what's next, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7817.64)|
| 2:10:23| we've spent a lot of energy tonight, um, dancing around the fact that we all agree that everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7823.64)|
| 2:10:30| including McNab, is open to a supplemental model that exists, um, in addition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7830.64)|
| 2:10:36| co-responder model. I think there's some disagreement about whether the co-responder model needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7836.64)|
| 2:10:41| to continue or whether this needs to be, um, but there is agreement on it being an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7841.64)|
| 2:10:46| program, and I want to thank people who spoke to me and educated me about it doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7846.64)|
| 2:10:51| to be either or. So, there's broad consensus here that we need another program to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7851.64)|
| 2:10:57| a gap, and I think the administration, um, along with McNab, who has two years' worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7857.64)|
| 2:11:03| of data about what they've seen good, bad, and different, and they have a fresh perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7863.64)|
| 2:11:07| from other models across the, the nation where this is working. So, council getting involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7867.64)|
| 2:11:13| in chairing committees and having folks is not the problem. The problem is a next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7873.64)|
| 2:11:19| where people, uh, in addition to McNab and the administration are welcomed into what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7879.64)|
| 2:11:25| that could look like, and the biggest obvious practical thing is there's not anybody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7885.64)|
| 2:11:31| deliver this. So, whether it's this committee, whether it's the administration, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7891.64)|
| 2:11:36| the past two years, it's, everybody can do enough research, there's enough smart people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7896.64)|
| 2:11:40| in this room to do research of what this program could look like. Nobody's willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7900.64)|
| 2:11:44| to do it yet. So, I don't want to skip past that, and us banging around for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7904.64)|
| 2:11:50| or two months or a year with committees and different groups is actually not a required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7910.64)|
| 2:11:57| thing to take this ball forward. We know what the ingredients are, there are people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7917.64)|
| 2:12:01| are out there, they're willing to voice into what the, the scope of the service looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7921.64)|
| 2:12:06| The administration, as far as I've discussed, there's not a gap in funding to take the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7926.64)|
| 2:12:12| step. Yes, we need more parties at the table, but, uh, it doesn't have to be limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7932.64)|
| 2:12:17| the city or the state or, or any individual agency. So, I'm not convinced, and I've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7937.64)|
| 2:12:24| this at length with the members of HEART and the administration, I'm not convinced that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7944.64)|
| 2:12:28| a task force by council is what's required. I think it makes it feel like there's a next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7948.64)|
| 2:12:33| step, but as long as this administration, which I think I've heard, is committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7953.64)|
| 2:12:38| continue to pursue the scope of this program, there's a willing agency that's, uh, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7958.64)|
| 2:12:45| able to take this on, I think there's, there's a will there. So, in my opinion, you can amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7965.64)|
| 2:12:52| this resolution, you can withdraw it, you can replace it, whatever it takes. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7972.64)|
| 2:12:56| think I'm going to bring anything, not that I don't want to serve on this, and not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7976.64)|
| 2:13:00| I don't spend a lot of energy with folks who are unhoused and, and, uh, and need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7980.64)|
| 2:13:05| I just don't think that city council is the answer, uh, or the expert to take this ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7985.64)|
| 2:13:11| forward. Between McNab, the administration, and HEART, all the experts are there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7991.64)|
| 2:13:18| my understanding is the funding's there to take this ball forward. So, I'm not, I'm kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7998.64)|
| 2:13:24| of indifferent on whether this thing works or that thing, but picking a number and forming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8004.64)|
| 2:13:29| a committee by council just seems like, um, it, it's an act of fresh, genuine frustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8009.64)|
| 2:13:37| and, and, and fair enough, because it's been a couple years of waiting for the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8017.64)|
| 2:13:43| With that said, this is a new model that we're experiencing right now, we should hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8023.64)|
| 2:13:49| McNab what they're learning. They don't necessarily want to do this program, but they're willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8029.64)|
| 2:13:53| to let someone else, and I think that's a big deal from where we started two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8033.64)|
| 2:13:58| Thank you, Councilmember Smith. Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8038.64)|
| 2:14:01| Yes. Um, all the points that were made at the podium were well taken, and we all want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8041.64)|
| 2:14:09| to get to the same place. It's just simply a question, well, not simply, because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8049.64)|
| 2:14:14| complicated, about how to get there. Um, some of the points that, uh, Councilman Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8054.64)|
| 2:14:21| uh, made about, uh, how to approach this problem, I think were...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8061.64)|
| 2:14:26| Councilman Thomas, can you pull your mic closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8066.64)|
| 2:14:28| I can. Are, are, uh, quite good, and, uh, one of the concerns I have is how we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8068.64)|
| 2:14:37| forward in a unified way, and what I have been hearing, uh, also just from discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8077.64)|
| 2:14:44| with the community and with staff and McNab, uh, there seems to be, um, not a unity between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8084.64)|
| 2:14:53| and the people that are working in conjunction with the city and McNab, uh, somebody's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8093.64)|
| 2:14:59| hearing each other, somebody's not meeting together. I don't know what it is. Um, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8099.64)|
| 2:15:04| to paraphrase, or to use Councilman Smith's word, I think we may have a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8104.64)|
| 2:15:09| a people problem there, and, um, we don't need to get it cross-purposes, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8109.64)|
| 2:15:16| one reason why I have reservations, I haven't excluded it, but have reservations about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8116.64)|
| 2:15:23| setting up an independent group, uh, when we already have a group that's done an extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8123.64)|
| 2:15:30| amount of work through McNab and have partially put in a program. So, I guess I will just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8130.64)|
| 2:15:38| leave it with a question, regardless of whether we do two separate groups or unify the groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8138.64)|
| 2:15:45| how do we move forward with communication and unity so that we're not operating under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8145.64)|
| 2:15:53| cross-purposes and that we can really have all the players in the room dealing in a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8153.64)|
| 2:16:01| way about who's doing what and what gaps need to be, uh, addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8161.64)|
| 2:16:09| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas. Uh, Councilmember Ryder? I don't know if you, or Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8169.64)|
| 2:16:16| Go ahead. Councilmember Ryder? And then Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8176.64)|
| 2:16:21| Sure. I just wanted to respond to, um, I think, um, Councilman Smith and Councilman Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8181.64)|
| 2:16:26| just made some valid points, and I think that loops back to something, um, Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8186.64)|
| 2:16:31| Singh said a few moments ago. A couple other things have been brought up here tonight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8191.64)|
| 2:16:36| have got started were, like, the BHUC is one of those. Um, that was before we all got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8196.64)|
| 2:16:41| on Council. I recall very much when that got put in place. Um, the issue, those were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8201.64)|
| 2:16:49| done with a task force. So, asking questions about the task force and how it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8209.64)|
| 2:16:54| work is a legitimate question, because I think the reason, as Councilman Thomas just pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8214.64)|
| 2:17:00| out, the ask for the task force is really a response to the frustration. I've sat down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8220.64)|
| 2:17:05| in meetings with people from HEART, because it, you know, nobody's saying, no, an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8225.64)|
| 2:17:11| response team is not the way to go. It's just no one wants to do it. Who's supposed to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8231.64)|
| 2:17:16| out who's going to do it? We feel that they're asking us to figure out who's going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8236.64)|
| 2:17:20| it. It, you know what? I just got to say to you guys, I'm not saying I'm opposed, so please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8240.64)|
| 2:17:28| stop assuming that I'm against. Councilwoman Parker asked us to discuss with her, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8248.64)|
| 2:17:34| with her. Because of Sunshine, we don't get to go have meetings with her on Zoom, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8254.64)|
| 2:17:39| having the discussion, because that's what she asked for, and I think that's fair. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8259.64)|
| 2:17:44| thanks for letting us have that discussion so we can legally do it. The issue that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8264.64)|
| 2:17:50| trying to get at is that a task force didn't happen in those instances because there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8270.64)|
| 2:17:54| buy-in from the administration, and the reason, thank you, Councilwoman Parker, for agreeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8274.64)|
| 2:17:59| with me. That's the elephant in the room we're talking about, okay? And the buy-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8279.64)|
| 2:18:04| I'm not trying to throw people under the bus, is a capacity issue. We asked Helen Ross-McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8284.64)|
| 2:18:10| to do the beehook. We asked Helen Ross-McNabb to do empath. We asked Helen Ross-McNabb to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8290.64)|
| 2:18:15| do co-responder. We asked them to do this. We asked them to do that. They're understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8295.64)|
| 2:18:21| You want to be a social worker, a clinical social worker, jobs are in abundance. Heck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8301.64)|
| 2:18:25| if you want to be a teacher, you want to be a policeman, you know, there's no workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8305.64)|
| 2:18:29| for anything, apparently, anymore. So we've asked them to do everything, so we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8309.64)|
| 2:18:34| to figure out who else to ask, and that's what Hart's been going at. So all I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8314.64)|
| 2:18:39| trying to say is I don't know that the task force is going to force the buy-in. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8319.64)|
| 2:18:44| all. That's all I'm trying to say. I'm just being frank and blunt, and I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8324.64)|
| 2:18:50| what I heard Councilman Smith say, and Councilman Thomas, is that are we going to force the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8330.64)|
| 2:18:58| hand of buy-in from somewhere and somehow. So I just don't want to set it up for failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8338.64)|
| 2:19:04| That's all. I'm not saying not vote for it, because I don't want to set it up for failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8344.64)|
| 2:19:08| I'm just being frank and saying out loud what you didn't say. Is that fair enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8348.64)|
| 2:19:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8352.64)|
| 2:19:13| I don't want to put words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8353.64)|
| 2:19:15| Well, I just don't see the process as a means to force an outcome. I really don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8355.64)|
| 2:19:22| set it up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8362.64)|
| 2:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8363.64)|
| 2:19:24| But I think, and also, you know, from council members and the administration, I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8364.64)|
| 2:19:29| a lot of positivity, but also a lot of question. And so if there is a lot of positivity and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8369.64)|
| 2:19:35| a lot of questions, my hope would be that the task force provides a space to help create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8375.64)|
| 2:19:40| some clarity, whereas we, you know, we spent another hour again trying to get some clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8380.64)|
| 2:19:46| and we're just not going to get clarity in this space. There's too many answers to, too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8386.64)|
| 2:19:51| many questions to answer, too many reports to make sure we've all read and we're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8391.64)|
| 2:19:56| on the same page on. So that's really why I'm pushing for the task force, not because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8396.64)|
| 2:20:02| I think it will force an outcome, but really because I think it will create space. It will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8402.64)|
| 2:20:07| allow those of us on council who want to help take the lead on this to get involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8407.64)|
| 2:20:12| help take the lead, and recognize that there is limited capacity in the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8412.64)|
| 2:20:19| recognize that there are a lot of asks being made right now of our city that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8419.64)|
| 2:20:25| coming out of the pandemic, we have stood up new programs that need attention and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8425.64)|
| 2:20:34| But this is a space that where council can help move the ball forward, just like we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8434.64)|
| 2:20:40| done through workshop spaces and other things, because ultimately this is going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8440.64)|
| 2:20:45| come back before us for approval, to form it, to fund it. So I think it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8445.64)|
| 2:20:54| for us to form a task force around this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8454.64)|
| 2:21:00| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8460.64)|
| 2:21:04| Thank you, Mayor. I'd like to ask Ms. Riffwile if you could come back to the podium. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8464.64)|
| 2:21:10| a couple of questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8470.64)|
| 2:21:21| Thank you. And my apologies that I did not get an opportunity to meet with you guys before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8481.64)|
| 2:21:25| this came on before council. But just reviewing HART and the website, it looks like HART| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8485.64)|
| 2:21:35| has been doing some research these last two to three years around this topic and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8495.64)|
| 2:21:41| been advocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8501.64)|
| 2:21:42| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8502.64)|
| 2:21:43| Have you all had the opportunity to sit down with the chief, with the people who are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8503.64)|
| 2:21:49| involved with the co-responder team that's set up in KPD or with Helen Ross McDabb, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8509.64)|
| 2:21:56| of the programs that are already out there that we're hearing folks talk about, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8516.64)|
| 2:22:00| BHUG. Have you all had that opportunity to sit down with them and gather their data and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8520.64)|
| 2:22:05| just talk a little bit about some of the challenges that they're experiencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8525.64)|
| 2:22:09| We've had an incredible opportunity to sit down with Chief Noel, who was incredibly supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8529.64)|
| 2:22:15| of our proposal. We tried to give him our full spiel and he was like, stop, I'm on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8535.64)|
| 2:22:20| just immediately. So I encourage each of you to reach out to Chief Noel and ask him about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8540.64)|
| 2:22:25| how he feels about this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8545.64)|
| 2:22:27| We have not reached out to Helen Ross McDabb, honestly, about the co-response program because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8547.64)|
| 2:22:32| our values do not align with the co-response program. So while we're open, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8552.64)|
| 2:22:37| the task force would be a great time to do that, just our values do not align with police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8557.64)|
| 2:22:42| response at this time for mental health crises. So no, we have not sat down with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8562.64)|
| 2:22:49| And what about Cherokee? Have you guys had any conversations with Cherokee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8569.64)|
| 2:22:52| We've sent a lot of emails to a lot of different folks about meeting with us, and often we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8572.64)|
| 2:22:58| don't get responses. Because we are just a small volunteer group, we don't have funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8578.64)|
| 2:23:02| we don't have government backing or support. So it's kind of like a shot in the dark when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8582.64)|
| 2:23:08| you reach out. So that's what I feel the task force really accomplishes, is it allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8588.64)|
| 2:23:13| these people that are very busy with their own missions to come and, you know, get on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8593.64)|
| 2:23:18| this task force and accomplish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8598.64)|
| 2:23:20| Right. And so knowing that the ultimate goal is to establish an alternative response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8600.64)|
| 2:23:28| that will be able to full service meet the needs to identify all of the resources that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8608.64)|
| 2:23:33| are available. Because again, if you go out on a call and this person needs to be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8613.64)|
| 2:23:38| somewhere and there's nowhere to place them, you know, this is why I talk about the joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8618.64)|
| 2:23:42| venture and that people are coming to the table. By no means am I saying we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8622.64)|
| 2:23:46| to call the state and ask them to respond to a call or anything like that, but do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8626.64)|
| 2:23:50| need the state to be saying, yes, they're willing to put money into this city and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8630.64)|
| 2:23:54| help expand existing services, or as the bear talked about, you know, having some beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8634.64)|
| 2:23:59| somewhere and being able to expand on those beds. We know, again, that we have limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8639.64)|
| 2:24:04| resources. We have more people who need help than we have resources. And again, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8644.64)|
| 2:24:10| why, unfortunately, a lot of people land in Knox County Jail, which is where they do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8650.64)|
| 2:24:16| belong of all places. And so with that said, does HART already have a proposal as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8656.64)|
| 2:24:24| relates to, hey, this is what we would, if you had it today, if you could turn in a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8664.64)|
| 2:24:30| today, you all have it built out as to, you know, everything that you would need. I saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8670.64)|
| 2:24:35| that you do have, you've done some research on days of the week, the hours from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8675.64)|
| 2:24:40| cities that have these types of call responder teams where they feel are those hours where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8680.64)|
| 2:24:46| you would need staffing. And so how many teams would you all be looking at, just based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8686.64)|
| 2:24:52| the numbers that you've seen and you've gathered locally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8692.64)|
| 2:24:56| Sure. Just to address the first part, you'd mentioned, you know, the big question that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8696.64)|
| 2:25:00| I hear from a lot of city council members, which I think is very legitimate, is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8700.64)|
| 2:25:04| do these people go when we go to the calls? And I think what's missing on that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8704.64)|
| 2:25:09| is just the concept of de-escalation. For a lot of these folks, they're not willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8709.64)|
| 2:25:15| to go to services. Maybe they've had a really bad experience with getting mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8715.64)|
| 2:25:20| services, but there is a way to de-escalate them and prevent harm from a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8720.64)|
| 2:25:25| showing up on the scene. So it's not necessarily, you know, let's go fix this person's life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8725.64)|
| 2:25:30| forever. It's how can we prevent harm and how can we do what's best for this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8730.64)|
| 2:25:35| which might be just stabilizing them on the scene, creating a relationship with them where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8735.64)|
| 2:25:41| they know us, and we can provide that service. Another example that I love to give is, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8741.64)|
| 2:25:46| know, one of our members, Amelia James, she does de-escalation workshops for businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8746.64)|
| 2:25:51| and they always say, like, who can we call? They don't want to call police. But say, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8751.64)|
| 2:25:55| example, someone walks in a restaurant and is acting erratically and not leaving, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8755.64)|
| 2:25:59| could call and request Knoxville Heart. They would come. They have the de-escalation skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8759.64)|
| 2:26:04| to get that person out of the restaurant. Maybe they don't want to go on to further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8764.64)|
| 2:26:08| services, but we could prevent that escalation in that situation. So your second question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8768.64)|
| 2:26:14| was about do we have a proposal. Yes, we have a proposal that we've worked on. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8774.64)|
| 2:26:18| $400,000, and it funds three employees and a van and a bunch of other startup costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8778.64)|
| 2:26:24| It also includes a medical supervisor, which will be necessary if we have a medic on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8784.64)|
| 2:26:28| team, and an outfitted van and consultation from CAHOOTS in Denver Star. So that's $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8788.64)|
| 2:26:36| for a one-year pilot program, and it would be one van. So our data would be limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8796.64)|
| 2:26:41| We likely would start in one area of the city so that we could really focus in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8801.64)|
| 2:26:46| track that data. Sorry, what was your third question? I was trying to keep track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8806.64)|
| 2:26:59| I see a couple other people's lights on. Councilmember Smith? Thank you, Mayor. I don't really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8819.64)|
| 2:27:12| a question. We've talked, I think, a little bit about some of this comes from not feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8832.64)|
| 2:27:24| like you have a place at the table. And so even though you may disagree, this is my just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8844.64)|
| 2:27:29| ask of you, is even though you may disagree with the co-responder model fundamentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8849.64)|
| 2:27:34| because it has a police officer in there, they're still seeing hundreds of folks. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8854.64)|
| 2:27:38| so there's got to be some things that can be learned that would inspire or inform your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8858.64)|
| 2:27:46| program, because I think it's very important when you ask to be heard to also listen, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8866.64)|
| 2:27:52| the existing provider doesn't agree with all the things that you're going to recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8872.64)|
| 2:27:57| So I think this is part of the challenge. We all have to kind of open our ears and hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8877.64)|
| 2:28:04| one another. And if you want to speak to BGNAB, I'm sure there's 10 people here that can connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8884.64)|
| 2:28:09| you to it. They're going to tell you something that you didn't know. They're going to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8889.64)|
| 2:28:12| you something you disagree with. I completely agree, and it's something that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8892.64)|
| 2:28:16| do. And to be honest with you, our capacity is very limited. We've been doing this for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8896.64)|
| 2:28:20| three years. So as we grow our capacity, I hope that we can have more conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8900.64)|
| 2:28:25| with more people. So I completely agree with that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8905.64)|
| 2:28:29| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8909.64)|
| 2:28:31| Thank you. Ms. Riffald, I'm just curious. So the city orchestrated a workshop, the Sims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8911.64)|
| 2:28:40| workshop, in partnership with BGNAB. Were you all there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8920.64)|
| 2:28:44| We had a member there, but she was representing her employer, so she cannot speak to you hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8924.64)|
| 2:28:51| at that time. And the other members were unfortunately able to attend because it was during the workday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8931.64)|
| 2:28:55| and they couldn't take time off. But we have seen that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8935.64)|
| 2:29:00| Okay. So as you just mentioned, as far as BGNAB and their participation in the co-responder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8940.64)|
| 2:29:08| that wasn't a catalyst for not participating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8948.64)|
| 2:29:10| Oh, no. It was purely, you know, we have therapists on our role who have full days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8950.64)|
| 2:29:15| of sessions. We just cannot make it work during the workday. But we did have someone there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8955.64)|
| 2:29:19| who has told us how it went. They just couldn't speak on Hart's behalf because they were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8959.64)|
| 2:29:23| for their employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8963.64)|
| 2:29:24| Okay. Deputy Mayor Gill, would you mind expanding a little bit as far as the results of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8964.64)|
| 2:29:30| workshop and just doing a little more of a deep dive on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8970.64)|
| 2:29:34| Certainly. This is a summary based on the final report, which I know we shared with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8974.64)|
| 2:29:39| Council as part of your budget hearings earlier this month. So the strategic intercept mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8979.64)|
| 2:29:45| workshop did openly talk about alternative response. The process, when you lay it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8985.64)|
| 2:29:51| out, and again, you can read the report, that did not identify alternative response as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8991.64)|
| 2:29:56| key need, but it did validate co-response. And in several parts of the report, you talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8996.64)|
| 2:30:02| about, to Councilwoman McKenzie's point, where do you go next? And so discussions around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9002.64)|
| 2:30:10| the need for case management, for example, I think as your resolution points out, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9010.64)|
| 2:30:15| discusses kind of the gaps that we have in our community around housing, around transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9015.64)|
| 2:30:20| So it did think about the ways that we already have new types of resources, such as the BHUC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9020.64)|
| 2:30:27| or the MPATH unit, to respond to the needs of people with behavioral or mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9027.64)|
| 2:30:31| disorders. It did identify the need to expand and strengthen co-response, not just within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9031.64)|
| 2:30:37| KPD, but also within other jurisdictions that serve our community. For example, UTPD, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9037.64)|
| 2:30:43| Sheriff's Office. It supported the MPATH unit and the need for additional treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9043.64)|
| 2:30:48| facilities in real time to help people get access to mental health resources more quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9048.64)|
| 2:30:53| but it did not recommend pursuit of the alternative response model at this time. Again, not undermining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9053.64)|
| 2:30:59| the value of the system, but just kind of ranking it in the general prioritization as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9059.64)|
| 2:31:04| something that would fall below the co-response program and making sure that that is prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9064.64)|
| 2:31:14| Vice Mayor Roberto. Thank you, Mayor. You know, what I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9074.64)|
| 2:31:18| in this discussion is support for this model, support from the administration, support from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9078.64)|
| 2:31:25| Council. There was a word that Councilmember Thomas said just a little bit ago when he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9085.64)|
| 2:31:31| was discussing this, and he said the word unity. And I think there's an actual opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9091.64)|
| 2:31:37| here to leave today with unanimous support for this model, but from the discussion, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9097.64)|
| 2:31:44| very clear that some amendments are going to have to be made in order to do that. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9104.64)|
| 2:31:49| haven't had a motion yet at all on this. We've had a lot of good discussion, and I'm glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9109.64)|
| 2:31:54| we have, but I think we're at a point where we need to decide what we're going to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9114.64)|
| 2:32:03| I didn't bring the resolution, so I'm not going to propose any amendments, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9123.64)|
| 2:32:10| it's pretty clear from the discussion what those amendments would be. I'd be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9130.64)|
| 2:32:14| to support that if we did that, but that's up to Councilmember Parker, because she brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9134.64)|
| 2:32:20| the resolution. But I do think it's time to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9140.64)|
| 2:32:25| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9145.64)|
| 2:32:29| All right, excuse me. I agree, Vice Mayor Roberto. I think we've had a really healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9149.64)|
| 2:32:35| discussion tonight, and I really appreciate everyone's willingness to engage in that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9155.64)|
| 2:32:40| and weigh in and give us some clarity of where you stand at the moment on this issue. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9160.64)|
| 2:32:47| certainly a lot of support around the table, but it sounds like the resolution could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9167.64)|
| 2:32:53| a little more work. So one thing I would like to do is make a motion to postpone the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9173.64)|
| 2:33:01| until our June 27th meeting, allowing Councilmembers time to engage with community members, lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9181.64)|
| 2:33:09| up the amendments that they would like to see in order to support it, and let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9189.64)|
| 2:33:14| if we can come back in four weeks and walk away with a unanimous vote in favor of forming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9194.64)|
| 2:33:23| a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9203.64)|
| 2:33:24| I'll second that motion to postpone to July 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9204.64)|
| 2:33:29| Motion made to postpone. June 22nd, I'm sorry. Motion made by Ms. Parker, seconded by Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9209.64)|
