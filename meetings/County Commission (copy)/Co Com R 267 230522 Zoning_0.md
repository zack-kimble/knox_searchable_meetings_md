| 0:05:08| plans and I think are ready to start if they haven't already started construction on improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=308.0)|
| 0:05:14| at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=314.0)|

| 0:05:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=352.0)|
| 0:05:53| I know there's been some discussion through the Town of Farragut because this is within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=353.0)|
| 0:05:57| the Farragut urban growth boundary and they bring up some valid concerns and points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=357.0)|
| 0:06:02| I know the district commissioner is also aware of these, but just wondering if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=362.0)|
| 0:06:08| speak to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=368.0)|
| 0:06:09| You know, they are concerned about Fretz Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=369.0)|
| 0:06:12| They are concerned about some of the hillside protection area that the density is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=372.0)|
| 0:06:17| going to be higher in those developable areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=377.0)|
| 0:06:23| There's a sinkhole on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=383.0)|
| 0:06:26| Access, of course, is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=386.0)|
| 0:06:28| That curve on Fretz is a little tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=388.0)|
| 0:06:32| You know, they requested that there be a walking trail or a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=392.0)|
| 0:06:37| And then there's also that question of that left southbound turn lane project that should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=397.0)|
| 0:06:43| be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=403.0)|
| 0:06:44| So those are things that for me to support this, I would have to know that these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=404.0)|
| 0:06:49| are being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=409.0)|
| 0:06:51| So I kind of turn it over to our district commissioner, but I wanted to express my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=411.0)|
| 0:06:55| on behalf of those that I've been reading with the discussions going back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=415.0)|
| 0:07:01| with the town of Farragut and also engineering and planning folks within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=421.0)|
| 0:07:07| Let me, by way of response, ask Mr. Snowden to explain or at least describe generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=427.0)|
| 0:07:17| what's in the plans and the works for the traffic and or transportation issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=437.0)|
| 0:07:25| you've identified, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=445.0)|

| 0:08:11| The other issue related to the property itself, there are some areas where we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=491.0)|
| 0:08:26| have to deal with hillside issues and that will be another reason we'll be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=506.0)|
| 0:08:37| in doing planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=517.0)|
| 0:08:39| So we can move the units around better situated to the topography of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=519.0)|
| 0:08:46| Well, I think that's the concern is that you would be clustering those units and it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=526.0)|
| 0:08:52| be a higher density and therefore then it would not align with existing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=532.0)|
| 0:08:57| on the north and south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=537.0)|
| 0:09:00| So that's something that I hope we can consider as my peers are also considering this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=540.0)|
| 0:09:09| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=549.0)|
| 0:09:14| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=554.0)|
| 0:09:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=555.0)|
| 0:09:18| Mr. Snowden or Mr. Welch, were you provided a copy of this letter from the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=558.0)|
| 0:09:24| of the town of Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=564.0)|
| 0:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=566.0)|
| 0:09:27| Mr. Snowden, do you want to weigh in first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=567.0)|
| 0:09:30| Yeah, that same information was provided to the planning commissioners, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=570.0)|
| 0:09:36| from the town planner, Mark Shipley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=576.0)|
| 0:09:39| And our sidewalk ordinance, the town had previously required a developer to install pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=579.0)|
| 0:09:46| facilities down Fred's Road really to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=586.0)|
| 0:09:52| So we would require as part of our sidewalk ordinance, Mr. Huber, the developer to install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=592.0)|
| 0:10:02| sidewalks all along his frontage, throughout his frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=602.0)|
| 0:10:07| And then we would also, obviously, we require, and this being street posted 30 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=607.0)|
| 0:10:16| we'd require 300 foot of sight distance in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=616.0)|
| 0:10:19| We also have some similar concerns about the access and the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=619.0)|
| 0:10:23| So we're consistent with Mr. Shipley's comments and we'll make sure that those are addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=623.0)|
| 0:10:30| through the permitting phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=630.0)|
| 0:10:32| Do you have a rough idea where the front entrance is going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=632.0)|
| 0:10:37| I have not seen the site plan, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=637.0)|
| 0:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=640.0)|
| 0:10:41| And then, Mr. Welch, was there anything from your team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=641.0)|
| 0:10:44| No, we just felt that the zoning was, requested zoning and density was consistent within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=644.0)|
| 0:10:50| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=650.0)|
| 0:10:52| Part of the property, less than an acre and a half, is in the hillside protection, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=652.0)|
| 0:10:57| not a significant amount of the area would be impacted by this development or concentrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=657.0)|
| 0:11:02| in much higher density than what's proposed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=662.0)|
| 0:11:05| Typically, the density requested and what's actually built is not comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=665.0)|
| 0:11:10| It's usually less density than what's requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=670.0)|
| 0:11:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=675.0)|
| 0:11:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=676.0)|

| 0:11:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=681.0)|
| 0:11:23| I know this is, we're talking about the sector plan, but obviously the zoning is coming right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=683.0)|
| 0:11:27| behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=687.0)|
| 0:11:28| Mr. Welch, Mr. Snowden, whoever can answer, I mean, much of what you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=688.0)|
| 0:11:33| is part of what happens during the planned residential process, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=693.0)|
| 0:11:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=697.0)|
| 0:11:38| And can you, I mean, I just want to make sure, like, some of these discussions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=698.0)|
| 0:11:43| that, and the other, that's the purpose for having planned residential, so it goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=703.0)|
| 0:11:47| a more strenuous process and you do everything from sidewalks to traffic to this and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=707.0)|
| 0:11:52| and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=712.0)|
| 0:11:53| Yeah, public hearing, public review of it, and a plan submitted to a planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=713.0)|
| 0:11:58| reviewed by planning and engineering staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=718.0)|
| 0:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=721.0)|
| 0:12:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=722.0)|
| 0:12:04| Any more discussion from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=724.0)|
| 0:12:07| Seeing none, I'll turn it over to Commissioner Hill, District 6 Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=727.0)|
| 0:12:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=732.0)|
| 0:12:14| Addressing the first item, I'd like to make a motion that we approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=734.0)|

| 0:13:15| As I mentioned in my other discussion, I talked about both at the same time, so I would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=795.0)|
| 0:13:21| that there be approval for the request for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=801.0)|

| 0:13:52| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=832.0)|
| 0:13:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=834.0)|
| 0:13:55| Just a couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=835.0)|
| 0:13:57| Did the applicant or did you reach out to the community for any input or to have a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=837.0)|
| 0:14:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=843.0)|
| 0:14:04| I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=844.0)|
| 0:14:05| Did the applicant reach out to the community or those adjacent property owners to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=845.0)|
| 0:14:10| a discussion about his plans for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=850.0)|
| 0:14:13| We didn't, in this particular instance, we didn't identify a neighborhood group or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=853.0)|
| 0:14:19| association or anything like that to notify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=859.0)|
| 0:14:23| We did, I did see a couple of the letters that came in and I have made no effort to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=863.0)|
| 0:14:30| contact those people, but there wasn't a, there wasn't a group of neighbors together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=870.0)|
| 0:14:37| in any kind of an association or membership to notify or to try to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=877.0)|
| 0:14:45| So no efforts have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=885.0)|
| 0:14:47| And then, would you be willing to do road improvements first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=887.0)|
| 0:14:52| Would we be willing to do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=892.0)|
| 0:14:54| The road improvements first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=894.0)|
| 0:14:57| Road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=897.0)|
| 0:14:59| Well, the problem, again, I might have had a better understanding of exactly when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=899.0)|
| 0:15:07| were going to start and how long it was going to take, but routinely they would take longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=907.0)|
| 0:15:13| to get through this process, their process, than this would take to go through our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=913.0)|
| 0:15:21| We are going to have to come back before this body, again, with a plan for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=921.0)|
| 0:15:31| We'd rather not put ourselves behind the county because sometimes with the best of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=931.0)|
| 0:15:38| intentions they might not get started when they thought and they might not finish when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=938.0)|
| 0:15:42| they thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=942.0)|
| 0:15:43| We'd like to measure our schedule on the basis of our particular project rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=943.0)|
| 0:15:50| artificially, if you will, tie it to the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=950.0)|
| 0:15:54| Well, a consideration is, and I might be mistaken on this, but I don't think so, that the Town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=954.0)|
| 0:15:59| of Farragut, their transportation study or plan actually includes turn lanes for Fretz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=959.0)|

| 0:16:09| So those are things I also think should be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=969.0)|
| 0:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=974.0)|
| 0:16:16| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=976.0)|

| 0:16:45| Mr. Snowden, when are the county road improvements in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1005.0)|
| 0:16:50| We just went through, obviously, the authorization of that, but help me understand the implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1010.0)|
| 0:16:55| of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1015.0)|
| 0:16:56| We're in the process now of evaluating or putting a value on the acquisitions that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1016.0)|
| 0:17:02| need to do for the turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1022.0)|
| 0:17:06| We have actually over-designed the length of that turn lane to accommodate not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1026.0)|
| 0:17:14| this development, but just the traffic in general because of the proximity of Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1034.0)|
| 0:17:19| Park Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1039.0)|
| 0:17:20| The developments that are out there now, that are out there and proposed, I think they require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1040.0)|
| 0:17:26| a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1046.0)|
| 0:17:27| I'm going off memory here, but it was something like 200 feet of left turn lane storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1047.0)|
| 0:17:32| We're actually going to build about 300 feet just because we didn't want to transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1052.0)|
| 0:17:37| back right there at another existing dead-end road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1057.0)|
| 0:17:41| So, we're over-building the left turn lane capacity for the area, so there won't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1061.0)|
| 0:17:49| be any concern for me in regard to the improvements along Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1069.0)|
| 0:17:55| And then, obviously, everything along Fred's Road, as we develop those site plans, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1075.0)|
| 0:18:01| make sure that if any shoulder work, drainage work, or sidewalk is required, we'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1081.0)|
| 0:18:08| the developer complete those improvements as part of the development plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1088.0)|
| 0:18:13| Do you have a rough timeline of when you think the county portion of the work will be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1093.0)|
| 0:18:19| We hope to have it under construction this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1099.0)|
| 0:18:23| Probably won't be done until summer of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1103.0)|
| 0:18:26| And as it relates to the project, if approved tonight, you still have to go through planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1106.0)|
| 0:18:33| I mean, you have to go back through planning with PR, and that takes several months, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1113.0)|
| 0:18:39| guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1119.0)|
| 0:18:40| Is that accurate, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1120.0)|
| 0:18:42| I'm trying to figure out when they would be done with their portion as it relates to when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1122.0)|
| 0:18:47| your timeline would begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1127.0)|
| 0:18:49| Well, generally speaking, you decide what it is you're going to do or want to do, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1129.0)|
| 0:18:55| you do a concept plan, submit that concept plan, and go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1135.0)|
| 0:19:00| You're talking about a minimum of three to four months from the time you make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1140.0)|
| 0:19:07| what it is you want to try to put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1147.0)|
| 0:19:10| So, Mr. Snowden, is what you're saying, you would coordinate with the developer to, while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1150.0)|
| 0:19:16| you're doing your portion, to maybe have it all done at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1156.0)|
| 0:19:20| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1160.0)|
| 0:19:22| Given that it's probably next spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1162.0)|
| 0:19:24| Assuming the general timeline of the grading that we would see for the scope and scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1164.0)|
| 0:19:29| of this development, I would foresee our transportation improvements being done before certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1169.0)|
| 0:19:35| occupancies are issued on these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1175.0)|
| 0:19:37| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1177.0)|
| 0:19:38| So, it sounds like it's generally on the same timeline, but obviously everything depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1178.0)|
| 0:19:44| on getting through the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1184.0)|
| 0:19:46| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1186.0)|

| 0:20:10| You are correct, Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1210.0)|
| 0:20:12| They do, and it is disappointing that the developer did not reach out to some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1212.0)|
| 0:20:19| neighbors to try to talk with them because there is a pretty big difference between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1219.0)|

| 0:20:29| Well, Mr. Huber generally does meet with the organized groups or people who have a spokesperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1229.0)|
| 0:20:36| or who make contact directly with him or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1236.0)|

| 0:22:27| It's sort of a constant drumbeat of why reduce housing where you're near a major artery, you're in an area of high growth, you're in an area of lots of access, and we need the inventory or we're going to get further and further and further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1347.0)|
| 0:22:40| We keep doing the same 3, 3.5 units an acre sprawl, and it's not helping our overall picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1360.0)|

| 0:24:53| The vote is four ayes, six noes, and one pass, so that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1493.0)|
| 0:24:59| So, we're back to the original motion to approve planned residential up to 3.5 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1499.0)|
| 0:25:07| Now, may I speak on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1507.0)|
| 0:25:10| You may, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1510.0)|
| 0:25:12| We can't really do anything that's in the proposal if it's only at 2.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1512.0)|
| 0:25:30| We've got some constraints on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1530.0)|
| 0:25:35| There will be some discussion about what is and isn't developable practically and otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1535.0)|
| 0:25:47| and we really need the capability of going up to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1547.0)|
| 0:25:57| We're already aware that we're going to have to sort of cluster some of these units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1557.0)|
| 0:26:05| and to the extent you restrict the number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1565.0)|
| 0:26:13| you severely affect utilization of the property for its best and intended purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1573.0)|
| 0:26:26| I don't like to take that position, and I don't take it lightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1586.0)|
| 0:26:34| but I would say that if it's at 2.3 or 3.5, I believe is what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1594.0)|
| 0:26:44| 3.5 units an acre, I think this project is going to be in a status where it can't go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1604.0)|
| 0:26:53| I think that would be a bad thing to happen because it's a good piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1613.0)|
| 0:26:59| in a good location, and with the right approach to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1619.0)|
| 0:27:05| which Mr. Huber has done quality work all over this county with the right approach to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1625.0)|
| 0:27:11| it will be done very well, and that's why he would like to be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1631.0)|
| 0:27:19| To the extent you start limiting the number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1639.0)|
| 0:27:24| particularly on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1644.0)|
| 0:27:29| it very substantially affects the possibility of whether it can be developed at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1649.0)|
| 0:27:39| in light of that restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1659.0)|
| 0:27:44| The property immediately south and adjoining our boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1664.0)|
| 0:27:49| is a subdivision development done at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1669.0)|
| 0:27:59| Perhaps a representative of Planning Commission could tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1679.0)|
| 0:28:04| of some others in the general area, but five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1684.0)|
| 0:28:11| is what we ask for, that's what we really need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1691.0)|
| 0:28:16| and while from y'all's standpoint it might not be that big an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1696.0)|
| 0:28:21| that bit of difference, many times from the developer's standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1701.0)|
| 0:28:28| that's the question of whether it's go or no go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1708.0)|
| 0:28:34| So we would respectfully request that you vote no on the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1714.0)|
| 0:28:40| for three and a half dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1720.0)|
| 0:28:45| or vote on five dwelling units per acre and approve five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1725.0)|
| 0:28:53| After all, the planners said unanimously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1733.0)|
| 0:28:58| staff and Planning Commission itself approved five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1738.0)|
| 0:29:08| They're the ones who look out for things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1748.0)|
| 0:29:13| It's good to go with five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1753.0)|
| 0:29:19| Thank you. Commissioner Jay, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1759.0)|
| 0:29:24| Thank you, Madam Chair. I guess I just have a question for my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1764.0)|
| 0:29:29| who obviously the substitute motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1769.0)|
| 0:29:34| I'm terribly confused, and I think it's worth a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1774.0)|
| 0:29:39| a presentation that says when you have less inventory, you have higher prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1779.0)|
| 0:29:44| You're not going to have an affordable place to live in Knox County without more inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1784.0)|
| 0:29:49| We've talked about other counties who have reduced the amount of development they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1789.0)|
| 0:29:54| and suffered grave consequences to their workforce, to their economic base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1794.0)|
| 0:30:00| and this commission, and members of this commission have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1800.0)|
| 0:30:05| that we value planning commission's opinion when we really like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1805.0)|
| 0:30:14| but then sometimes we don't, and this is a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1814.0)|
| 0:30:19| I'm incredibly confused by this body when we have a high-growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1819.0)|
| 0:30:24| in an urban setting on major corridors, and we don't take the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1824.0)|
| 0:30:29| to seek growth as gone through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1829.0)|
| 0:30:35| and the entire process. I don't care if it's this builder or another builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1835.0)|
| 0:30:40| We are exacerbating our own problems by not taking the opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1840.0)|
| 0:30:45| This is an open question for the commissioners of why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1845.0)|
| 0:30:50| Help me understand why this is not a perfect example of why you put growth where growth is for growth's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1850.0)|
| 0:30:55| I don't know if anybody wants to answer it, but it's a valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1855.0)|
| 0:31:00| I just don't get it, and I'm really wondering what is the justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1860.0)|
| 0:31:05| when time after time this body has said this is exactly what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1865.0)|
| 0:31:12| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1872.0)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. King, what price range are you going to be in with these houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1877.0)|
| 0:31:23| Hi. My name's Stacey McDonald. I work for John Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1883.0)|
| 0:31:30| Sorry. My name's Stacey McDonald. I work for John Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1890.0)|
| 0:31:35| My address is 113 Ladbrook Lane, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1895.0)|
| 0:31:40| In fact, I live maybe a mile or two away from where this development will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1900.0)|
| 0:31:45| We're looking at prices in the $300,000 to $350,000 range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1905.0)|
| 0:31:50| which is about the average price in Knox County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1910.0)|
| 0:31:55| One thing I wanted to commit to, Commissioner Fraser, we will be happy to speak with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1915.0)|
| 0:32:00| We have a long history of speaking with the neighbors and working with them to make sure that everybody understands the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1920.0)|
| 0:32:07| and is at least informed, if not happy, about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1927.0)|
| 0:32:12| We've done that historically. In fact, I was at one of those meetings just a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1932.0)|
| 0:32:17| actually in the city limits. We always do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1937.0)|
| 0:32:22| We work hard with Mr. Snowden in engineering to make sure that those developments are always as appropriate to the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1942.0)|
| 0:32:32| and the topography of the site as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1952.0)|
| 0:32:37| We have continuously good relationships and good experiences with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1957.0)|
| 0:32:42| We want to make sure that everybody's aware. We're happy to do all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1962.0)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1967.0)|
| 0:32:52| That was part of my question. I got quite a few e-mails. I'm not sure about any of the other commissioners about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1972.0)|
| 0:32:57| Hearing that the developer has not reached out before all the e-mails and before we're here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1977.0)|
| 0:33:04| concerns me because I like when a developer will be proactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1984.0)|
| 0:33:09| which causes a lot less problems down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1989.0)|
| 0:33:14| If every developer would hear that, it causes a lot less problems at commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1994.0)|
| 0:33:19| If the commission can know that the developer has tried to work with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=1999.0)|
| 0:33:24| are you going to make everybody happy 100% of the time? Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2004.0)|
| 0:33:29| But you've made that effort to do that, and that, to me, goes a really long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2009.0)|
| 0:33:34| So these are some of the concerns that the commission has to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2014.0)|
| 0:33:39| I agree with Commissioner Jay. We need more housing, but we have to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2019.0)|
| 0:33:44| to be respectful also of the people that have been here and paying 30 years of property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2024.0)|
| 0:33:49| in that same aspect of what Commissioner Fraser is speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2029.0)|
| 0:33:54| So I would just like to see that next time, that that's done proactively as opposed to reactively now that you guys are down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2034.0)|
| 0:34:00| Yes, ma'am. I apologize. I'm not sure how we have overlooked that step. It's our mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2040.0)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2045.0)|
| 0:34:21| I don't know this developer personally. I don't really have an opinion either way on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2061.0)|
| 0:34:26| but I do agree with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2066.0)|
| 0:34:31| I don't understand either, especially when there's five units an acre next to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2071.0)|
| 0:34:38| If I'm in their shoes, they're going to sue the county, and they're going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2078.0)|
| 0:34:44| well, the legislative body is saying, well, you didn't talk to people this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2084.0)|
| 0:34:49| therefore we didn't give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2089.0)|
| 0:34:54| I don't understand either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2094.0)|
| 0:34:59| There's a road that's being developed to handle all the extra traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2099.0)|
| 0:35:04| I don't understand either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2104.0)|
| 0:35:09| And now we're going to probably waste taxpayer dollars defending a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2109.0)|
| 0:35:14| And I'm also having a hard time. So if anybody else wants to explain why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2114.0)|
| 0:35:19| I would love to understand why besides you didn't talk to enough neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2119.0)|
| 0:35:24| I don't know if that argument holds up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2124.0)|
| 0:35:29| I'm trying to make sense of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2129.0)|
| 0:35:34| Thank you, Commissioner Ward. Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2134.0)|
| 0:35:39| Thank you, Madam Chair. Commissioner Ward, to that point, this is located in the Farragut Urban Growth Boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2139.0)|
| 0:35:44| So you have to take into consideration their design standards and their Planning Commission request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2144.0)|
| 0:35:52| That differentiates this piece of property from others that I would probably be in favor of five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2152.0)|
| 0:36:05| This is right along the boundary of the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2165.0)|
| 0:36:10| You can actually look at the map and see the county lines where we have them at five and four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2170.0)|
| 0:36:19| And then you can clearly see the town of Farragut's density is much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2179.0)|
| 0:36:26| So I think this is a compromise in an area where it is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2186.0)|
| 0:36:32| So I understand your argument. I understand Commissioner Jay's argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2192.0)|
| 0:36:37| I want higher density where there are major corridors as well. This isn't a major corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2197.0)|
| 0:36:42| This is not a major corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2202.0)|
| 0:36:47| Is the property in Farragut? It is in the Urban Growth Boundary of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2207.0)|
| 0:36:53| And I think that it is responsible of this body to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2213.0)|
| 0:36:58| So that's what differentiates this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2218.0)|
| 0:37:06| Any more discussion before I go to the District Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2226.0)|
| 0:37:11| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2231.0)|
| 0:37:16| Thank you. Ms. McDonald? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2236.0)|
| 0:37:21| Thank you. Thank you for standing up and clarifying some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2241.0)|
| 0:37:26| I'm not sure why we would take this move or why I would make this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2246.0)|
| 0:37:32| I will tell you not that a developer or a builder is under any obligation to communicate with anyone on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2252.0)|
| 0:37:42| But to my knowledge, I've heard nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2262.0)|
| 0:37:47| I've heard, you know, and we don't have the advantage of a site plan, which I know isn't required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2267.0)|
| 0:37:53| But there's nothing there to put your hands on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2273.0)|
| 0:37:58| What I do have in front of me is a letter from the town of Farragut stating their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2278.0)|
| 0:38:03| Letters from several surrounding neighbors, all stating their concerns about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2283.0)|
| 0:38:10| There is nothing in this that talks about any green space or, you know, a walking trail was asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2290.0)|
| 0:38:16| That's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2296.0)|
| 0:38:21| As we know, at least two of the acres is not even going to be buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2301.0)|
| 0:38:26| So there is going to be clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2306.0)|
| 0:38:31| And then on top of all that, it does feed out onto what so many of our county roads are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2311.0)|
| 0:38:36| Little, narrow, winding, two-lane roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2316.0)|
| 0:38:42| Those are the reasons, collectively, why I didn't feel inclined to recommend the five-per-acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2322.0)|
| 0:38:51| Not to mention the fact that you are right there on that boundary and right next door is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2331.0)|
| 0:38:58| in their backyard is very expensive homes that probably if any of us had a choice in development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2338.0)|
| 0:39:04| we would prefer to have comparable building around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2344.0)|
| 0:39:13| So that is why I did what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2353.0)|
| 0:39:18| Now, I don't intend for everybody to get all bent out of shape about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2358.0)|
| 0:39:23| I would be happy to amend it to four if that makes everybody a little bit happier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2363.0)|
| 0:39:29| That will amount to a few more homes for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2369.0)|
| 0:39:34| But I do say these are the reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2374.0)|
| 0:39:39| I understand your reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2379.0)|
| 0:39:44| The financial feasibility of these projects, as they get smaller and more steep and more challenging sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2384.0)|
| 0:39:52| as Knox County runs out of buildable land, these things get more and more and more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2392.0)|
| 0:39:58| The higher dwelling units per acre helps us ameliorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2398.0)|
| 0:40:03| We can leave the hillsides in place, and I don't have the site plan in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2403.0)|
| 0:40:08| I don't know what that plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2408.0)|
| 0:40:13| Please don't hear that I'm promising anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2413.0)|
| 0:40:18| But you can make a lot of different choices when you have the ability to cluster more homes together in a smaller area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2418.0)|
| 0:40:23| and you leave a hillside in place that then doesn't have the environmental implications that we are all concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2423.0)|
| 0:40:31| Plus, the financial feasibility of these projects is just tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2431.0)|
| 0:40:36| The land gets more and more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2436.0)|
| 0:40:41| You don't want to drive the cost of the houses up to an unaffordable level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2441.0)|
| 0:40:46| So this is what the choices are that we make to try to put more houses on smaller pieces of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2446.0)|
| 0:40:54| Are you telling me you're honest to goodness going to build those homes at $300 to $350 each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2454.0)|
| 0:41:03| That is my understanding of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2463.0)|
| 0:41:08| John was going to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2468.0)|
| 0:41:13| He's at home in bed with a back problem, so he sent me down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2473.0)|
| 0:41:18| I feel like I'm making an idiot of myself. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2478.0)|
| 0:41:23| No, you're not. I appreciate what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2483.0)|
| 0:41:28| I will double check that with him and make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2488.0)|
| 0:41:33| In fact, I can do that over text message if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2493.0)|
| 0:41:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2498.0)|
| 0:41:43| We're at the rezoning stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2503.0)|
| 0:41:48| A lot of the questions you have are the kind of things that deal with the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2508.0)|
| 0:41:54| which is going to come later and go back to Planning Commission and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2514.0)|
| 0:41:59| A number of these issues will be dealt with there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2519.0)|
| 0:42:04| I think you can rely on Planning Commission to properly evaluate our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2524.0)|
| 0:42:14| Look at what we're proposing to do, how we propose to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2534.0)|
| 0:42:19| and make a reasoned judgment about whether it should be done this way or a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2539.0)|
| 0:42:28| I think that's their proper function, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2548.0)|
| 0:42:34| This body is really charged with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2554.0)|
| 0:42:42| is it a suitable piece of property to be rezoned in accordance with the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2562.0)|
| 0:42:49| and not so much about precisely what's going to be there and where and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2569.0)|
| 0:42:55| I'm not stating anything that's contrary to what the way it works or has worked up to this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2575.0)|
| 0:43:11| I think that those questions you may have will be adequately dealt with by Planning Commission at that appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2591.0)|
| 0:43:25| Well, with all due respect, Mr. King, and I do genuinely mean this with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2605.0)|
| 0:43:33| Planning Commission cannot at that point in time satisfy questions of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2613.0)|
| 0:43:40| Planning Commission at that point in time cannot suddenly turn that narrow, windy road into a wider road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2620.0)|
| 0:43:46| Planning Commission is not going to be able to take back the letter from the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2626.0)|
| 0:43:56| And Planning Commission may or may not decide to include green spaces, to include a walking trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2636.0)|
| 0:44:04| Those things are the preview here that Commission can do, and we have found out through the past few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2644.0)|
| 0:44:10| that sometimes we have to be sticklers about those things and include them, or in fact they don't get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2650.0)|
| 0:44:21| Builders with the best intentions sometimes may not follow through, and I'm not suggesting for one minute that that's the way Mr. Huber is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2661.0)|
| 0:44:30| Like I said, I don't know him at all, but genuinely with respect, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2670.0)|
| 0:44:36| those are the kind of things that Commission does, in fact, look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2676.0)|
| 0:44:42| Kind of the buck ends here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2682.0)|
| 0:44:50| John apologizes and corrects me that we are looking at $450,000 to $500,000 per house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2690.0)|
| 0:44:58| and I apologize for my misstatement earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2698.0)|
| 0:45:03| The 3.5 dwelling units per acre will not be a financially feasible project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2703.0)|
| 0:45:09| and we would prefer to withdraw the application at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2709.0)|
| 0:45:14| Thank you. Thank you. I think that might be wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2714.0)|
| 0:45:19| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2719.0)|
| 0:45:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2724.0)|
| 0:45:29| We are now proposing to take a vote on a motion to approve at 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2729.0)|
| 0:45:41| Is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2741.0)|
| 0:45:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2746.0)|
| 0:45:51| And on behalf of the applicant, we will withdraw the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2751.0)|
| 0:45:56| I have Commissioner Oster first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2756.0)|
| 0:46:06| Thank you. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2766.0)|
| 0:46:11| Mr. King, I don't understand what's going on here. I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2771.0)|
| 0:46:16| I can't say much more than what Commissioner Jay said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2776.0)|
| 0:46:21| That's why we passed this ordinance tonight on the road fixtures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2781.0)|
| 0:46:26| I don't understand. I really don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2786.0)|
| 0:46:31| We need housing. Fritz Road is a good road. It goes into Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2791.0)|
| 0:46:36| We're widening it to an over-packed turning lane, as Mr. Snowden just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2796.0)|
| 0:46:41| and we're turning down housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2801.0)|
| 0:46:46| I don't understand this commission. I could understand if he was asking for eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2806.0)|
| 0:46:51| I wouldn't be in for eight. I wouldn't be for six. I wouldn't be for seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2811.0)|
| 0:46:56| But you're only asking up to five, and the odds of you building out at five are going to be slim at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2816.0)|
| 0:47:01| So I am very disappointed that we can't come to a reasonable conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2821.0)|
| 0:47:10| We have Mr. Sales standing up there saying we've got to have housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2830.0)|
| 0:47:15| Then we turn around and vote down 1.5 houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2835.0)|
| 0:47:20| It just don't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2840.0)|
| 0:47:25| You know, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2845.0)|
| 0:47:30| we're supposed to be looking at the zoning only and look at the zoning and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2850.0)|
| 0:47:35| what is the requirement? Is this fit for five per acre or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2855.0)|
| 0:47:40| Zoning is a legislative act of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2860.0)|
| 0:47:45| You can rezone property for any reason that's rational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2865.0)|
| 0:47:50| So you could say there's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2870.0)|
| 0:47:55| surrounding this that's zoned at five units per acre, so I'm going to support that, and that would be a rational decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2875.0)|
| 0:48:00| You can say there's other property that's next to this that's two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2880.0)|
| 0:48:05| and we want to transition, as Commissioner Hill has stated, and that's a rational decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=2885.0)|

| 1:10:04| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to offer a substitute motion at 8.2 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4204.0)|
| 1:10:09| which is a compromise from what was approved at planning for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4209.0)|
| 1:10:14| If you look at KGIS and you look at the zoning map, a stone's throw from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4214.0)|
| 1:10:19| just up the street, there's a PR at nine units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4219.0)|

| 1:10:46| You have a major artery. All of Shod Road is going to be a major artery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4246.0)|
| 1:10:51| and we are going to continue to have more and more rezoning because we built the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4251.0)|
| 1:10:56| The very thing this commission has asked for. Build the infrastructure first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4256.0)|
| 1:11:01| Let the housing catch up. This is a prime example of where we have invested the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4261.0)|

| 1:11:26| Exactly what we have asked for. If you do the same old subdivision at the same old unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4286.0)|
| 1:11:31| it's not going to be affordable. They're not going to be able to build this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4291.0)|

| 1:12:34| Mr. Mullins, would you happen to know what the price point of these are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4354.0)|
| 1:12:39| or if they're even going to be homes for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4359.0)|
| 1:12:43| My understanding is they will be home for sale. They're townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4363.0)|
| 1:12:47| Each of them are going to be less than 2,000 square foot in attached housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4367.0)|
| 1:12:51| So I don't know what those price points would be, but just looking at that square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4371.0)|
| 1:12:56| attached housing, we'd be looking at something that would be sub-$300,000, would be my estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4376.0)|
| 1:13:01| For attached townhomes at less than 2,000 square feet, I mean, you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4381.0)|
| 1:13:06| I think the median Mr. Sell talked about, you know, for affordable housing is $315,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4386.0)|
| 1:13:11| We're going to be below that range. It's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4391.0)|
| 1:13:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4396.0)|

| 1:13:31| I've got to tell you, though, this is still just a beautiful piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4411.0)|
| 1:13:35| even with Chaud Road going down the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4415.0)|
| 1:13:38| That still is one of the few places left in Knox County that still has a very farm feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4418.0)|
| 1:13:45| and very rural and just feels good to drive down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4425.0)|
| 1:13:56| I'm not feeling optimistic about this one, but I hate to see, again, I support the transitional housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4436.0)|
| 1:14:04| but I think to jump from, as I said, a school and a church and farms, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=4444.0)|

| 1:25:56| what's surrounded by that area, they're all larger developments than what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5156.0)|

| 1:28:22| tree growing through it. So we did have it removed. Unless it was a treehouse. It was probably a good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5302.0)|
| 1:28:27| Right. Yeah, exactly. So. Okay. So there's no houses on it currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5307.0)|
| 1:28:32| And you'd like to put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5312.0)|
| 1:28:37| There's three three half acre three. You know, I would think at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5317.0)|

| 1:28:57| based on the size of the other lots. You know, I would be willing to support a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5337.0)|

| 1:30:11| to do, we feel like there's three lots of record there now. They could pull three building permits now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5411.0)|
| 1:30:16| We didn't want to increase the traffic and negatively impact the residents, but we felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5416.0)|
| 1:30:21| that it was fair to have three. So that's where we landed on the two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5421.0)|

| 1:32:41| Thank you, sir. Mr. Mullins. Essentially, there are two motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5561.0)|
| 1:32:46| here. The first one is the Sector Plan to Medium Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5566.0)|
| 1:32:51| I don't think that is controversial at all. Are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5571.0)|
| 1:32:56| issues with that? The property has been zoned at 1 to 8 units an acre since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5576.0)|
| 1:33:01| 2004. I'm not sure why, when the Sector Plan was updated, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5581.0)|
| 1:33:06| they intended to reduce the Sector Plan to LDR or it was just an error or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5586.0)|
| 1:33:11| an oversight. But this property has been medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5591.0)|

| 1:33:21| follow staff's recommendation on the MDR. I think the real conversation here is the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5601.0)|
| 1:33:26| and the density. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5606.0)|

| 1:33:41| hear members of this Commission's concern that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5621.0)|
| 1:33:46| not paying attention to the housing needs in this county. We do need much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5626.0)|
| 1:33:51| affordable housing. This development is a reasonable vehicle towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5631.0)|
| 1:33:56| But I do think some of the assumptions in the studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5636.0)|
| 1:34:01| quoted here are inaccurate, and I think some considerations for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5641.0)|

| 1:34:11| I think some people have treated this as a zero-sum game, and it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5651.0)|
| 1:34:16| need to be that way at all. This type of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5656.0)|
| 1:34:21| is desperately needed in this area, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5661.0)|

| 1:34:36| senior citizens downsizing into these properties. It's going to be new families with young children that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5676.0)|
| 1:34:41| going to be going to the local elementary school, which the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5681.0)|

| 1:35:06| 22 of those 24 opposition comments, is due to the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5706.0)|
| 1:35:11| on the road where this development is going to be built. It is an extremely narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5711.0)|

| 1:35:21| access. And now you're going to have a bus stop in the busiest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5721.0)|
| 1:35:26| times of the day, stopping at the end of this development, blocking traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5726.0)|
| 1:35:31| at least three times a day. And there's going to be very small children waiting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5731.0)|
| 1:35:36| that bus stop in a non-safe space. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5736.0)|
| 1:35:41| intuitively, I would ask you to support this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5741.0)|
| 1:35:46| but I would like you to condition it with some infrastructure. As Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5746.0)|
| 1:35:51| Jay, you quite accurately noted, what we've been begging this commission to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5751.0)|

| 1:36:01| And I do ask that you condition this development with the needed infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5761.0)|
| 1:36:06| for the protection of school children. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5766.0)|
| 1:36:11| I would also like some discussion or accommodation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5771.0)|
| 1:36:16| the traffic flow here. The quoted estimate is an increase of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5776.0)|
| 1:36:21| 475 turns in and out of this development a day. That just, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5781.0)|
| 1:36:27| seems low. I'm not sure where we would get that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5787.0)|
| 1:36:32| And given how busy and how unsafe this road is, I think it requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5792.0)|
| 1:36:37| attention. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5797.0)|

| 1:36:47| talking about the MDR. And I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=5807.0)|

| 1:42:52| of this project. He just wants it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6172.0)|
| 1:42:57| conditioned upon additional infrastructure, and I don't really know what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6177.0)|
| 1:43:02| means until we really get in and start studying that. I mean, this is a planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6182.0)|
| 1:43:07| development. There will be a development plan that moves forward through the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6187.0)|
| 1:43:12| There will be recommendations from Mr. Snowden and his engineering staff as to what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6192.0)|
| 1:43:17| means. Westland Drive is considered a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6197.0)|
| 1:43:22| arterial street. It only has 20 feet of pavement, but it's within a 52 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6202.0)|
| 1:43:27| to a 63 foot right-of-way, so there is room to potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6207.0)|
| 1:43:32| expand it, and we know expansion needs to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6212.0)|
| 1:43:37| and it's something the county needs to invest in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6217.0)|
| 1:43:42| and of course higher tax rates and higher tax bases can help do that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6222.0)|
| 1:43:47| we're aware that the traffic on Westland was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6227.0)|
| 1:43:52| Even before I got involved, Mr. Higgins had the foresight to email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6232.0)|
| 1:43:57| Mr. Snowden and ask him, okay, we're talking about right now we could do 8 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6237.0)|
| 1:44:02| We're proposing 12 units an acre, which the difference in that is an additional 16 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6242.0)|
| 1:44:07| So 16 units is the difference between what's allowed now and what could be allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6247.0)|
| 1:44:12| and the email to Mr. Snowden is, do you have any issues or concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6252.0)|
| 1:44:17| with this, either at the 30 units that it could go in now or the 46 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6257.0)|
| 1:44:22| and that email was attached to the letter with the planning commission. I hope you guys have seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6262.0)|
| 1:44:27| I did quote it in the email I sent last week, and I'll paraphrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6267.0)|
| 1:44:32| Mr. Snowden checked the traffic data on this section, about 9,000 vehicles per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6272.0)|
| 1:44:37| He said he would expect a noticeable decline in the level of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6277.0)|
| 1:44:42| with the addition of the trips generated from your development, regardless of the densities proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6282.0)|
| 1:44:47| So we're still within the existing level of service. We all know traffic is bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6287.0)|
| 1:44:52| sometimes on the Westlands, bad anywhere in Knox County, but you're dealing with a range of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6292.0)|
| 1:44:57| and it's not going to move it outside of that range one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6297.0)|
| 1:45:02| He also checked the crash data for the section, and he didn't think it was representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6302.0)|
| 1:45:07| of any deficiency or obvious trends. Mr. Britt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6307.0)|
| 1:45:12| questioned, I guess, how some of these numbers come into the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6312.0)|
| 1:45:17| Again, I'm not sure. I think Mr. Welch or Mr. Snowden could comment on it better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6317.0)|
| 1:45:22| I mean, they use traffic tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6322.0)|
| 1:45:27| to come up with the trip generation, and I don't know if Mr. Britt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6327.0)|
| 1:45:32| has any contrary statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6332.0)|
| 1:45:37| out to challenge 475 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6337.0)|
| 1:45:42| The estimated student yield, I think, if I recall, Mr. Welch, those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6342.0)|
| 1:45:47| come from the schools themselves. How do you come up with that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6347.0)|
| 1:45:52| For the students? For the student yield. We get the actual rate from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6352.0)|
| 1:45:57| the school board, what the rate is that they identify through the various types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6357.0)|
| 1:46:02| developments, and then we apply that rate to these types of developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6362.0)|
| 1:46:07| We can question whether that's an accurate number or not, but we're going straight to the horse's mouth on something like that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6367.0)|
| 1:46:12| Again, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6372.0)|
| 1:46:17| the type of development we're looking for. It serves, I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6377.0)|

| 1:46:47| investment in the infrastructure in the future. It needs to occur not just for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6407.0)|

| 1:47:17| Recommended what? Denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6437.0)|
| 1:47:22| Staff recommended denial of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6442.0)|
| 1:47:27| Well, we recommend up to eight dwellings per acre, so we felt that was more consistent with the adjacent density in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6447.0)|
| 1:47:32| But staff recommended denial of twelve? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6452.0)|
| 1:47:37| Also, can you tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6457.0)|
| 1:47:42| Mr. Mullins and Jim, or Director Snowden, Director Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6462.0)|
| 1:47:47| is there an area here to put a turn lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6467.0)|
| 1:47:52| I'd have to defer to the engineers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6472.0)|
| 1:47:57| I want to say, too, I took a look at your projects, and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6477.0)|
| 1:48:02| really impressed, and I really did like the creativity and the kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6482.0)|
| 1:48:07| of modernization that your designs brought, and I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6487.0)|
| 1:48:12| that's something that we're lacking in Knox County. I do have a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6492.0)|
| 1:48:17| about the road, and I mean, I've been on that road and turned my blinker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6497.0)|
| 1:48:22| on and tried to turn into something and almost got rear-ended. I mean, it's just one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6502.0)|
| 1:48:27| those roads, and so that's why I'm asking if there was any area where we could possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6507.0)|
| 1:48:32| put in some sort of turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6512.0)|
| 1:48:37| This property spans, we did a project back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6517.0)|
| 1:48:42| early 2000s to redo the intersection west of there at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6522.0)|
| 1:48:47| Galahar View, this terrible intersection there at Galahar View at Westland, and we transitioned this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6527.0)|
| 1:48:52| So if you'll notice, you drive out there, about a quarter, maybe a third of this project is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6532.0)|
| 1:48:57| running a curb street, and then the other half isn't, so it kind of fell in that transitional period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6537.0)|
| 1:49:02| of the road. The plat of record for these properties shows a 40-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6542.0)|
| 1:49:07| right-of-way, so 20 foot either side, so we wouldn't necessarily have the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6547.0)|
| 1:49:12| needed to do the improvements. I did look a little bit, just based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6552.0)|
| 1:49:17| their preliminary site plan, and made some assumptions, but looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6557.0)|
| 1:49:22| the need for either right-turn de-sale or left-in, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6562.0)|
| 1:49:27| the nomographs we used to calculate those didn't really, I didn't see the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6567.0)|
| 1:49:32| either, just because of the small number of trips, but right now it doesn't look like we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6572.0)|
| 1:49:37| have the right-of-way to really improve the road for a turn lane at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6577.0)|
| 1:49:52| Thank you, Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6592.0)|
| 1:49:57| I'm still kind of stuck on the staff's comments with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6597.0)|
| 1:50:02| improvement of infrastructure, and so, as many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6602.0)|
| 1:50:07| of the citizens wrote in, they agree with improvements of infrastructure. I'm trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6607.0)|
| 1:50:12| to identify what infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6612.0)|
| 1:50:17| could be considered. Maybe that's a more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6617.0)|
| 1:50:22| question to Director Snowden and Director Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6622.0)|
| 1:50:27| I know we're right outside of the PRZ zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6627.0)|
| 1:50:37| Do you see where I'm struggling here a little bit, where that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6637.0)|
| 1:50:42| we have is it's incompatible with surrounding development and infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6642.0)|
| 1:50:47| That was my fault, yeah. So what considerations can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6647.0)|
| 1:50:52| make to improve infrastructure, and what are you referring to, because that was the decision made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6652.0)|
| 1:50:57| by staff? I think if you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6657.0)|
| 1:51:02| just within the right-of-way, Jim and I were just chatting, if you could just put in shoulders, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6662.0)|
| 1:51:07| potentially right now it has no shoulders in that area, so at least you'd have some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6667.0)|
| 1:51:12| existing foot or two more on the outside of the lane for forgiveness along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6672.0)|
| 1:51:17| Is that something that could be done? Is that something that the applicant is willing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6677.0)|
| 1:51:27| The roadside's very level now, so it would be relatively easy to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6687.0)|
| 1:51:32| and I think that would be something. It looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6692.0)|
| 1:51:37| on our plans, it looked like we had a two-foot shoulder on either side of the white line before you got to the curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6697.0)|
| 1:51:42| so if they were to put a two-foot shoulder on their side, that would make it consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6702.0)|
| 1:51:47| what is, I guess, proceeding there, the west of there. And we'd be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6707.0)|
| 1:51:52| I mean, we hadn't had that level of detail. Of course, we haven't moved forward with our development plan through planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6712.0)|
| 1:51:57| yet, but other than the traffic, there's no infrastructure. I mean, there's plenty, there's utility capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6717.0)|
| 1:52:02| there. I mean, there's no other issues other than Westland Road itself, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6722.0)|
| 1:52:07| unfortunately, it's constrained in what can be done with it. And if we can make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6727.0)|
| 1:52:12| improvements along the way, I would like to suggest that. We tend to get too subjective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6732.0)|
| 1:52:17| with some of our considerations, and that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6737.0)|
| 1:52:22| I think advanced NOCs will address, but that's why I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6742.0)|
| 1:52:27| It was denied because it's not incompatible with surrounding development and infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6747.0)|
| 1:52:32| and then we have citizens who want improvements to infrastructure, so I just think it's important for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6752.0)|
| 1:52:37| to kind of identify what are those considerations, what can we do, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6757.0)|
| 1:52:42| let's just do it. So, thank you all for being agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6762.0)|
| 1:52:48| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier. Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6768.0)|
| 1:52:53| Commissioner Jay. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Welch, help me understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6773.0)|
| 1:52:58| a little bit more on that staff recommendation, because I'm looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6778.0)|
| 1:53:03| every other neighborhood east and west of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6783.0)|
| 1:53:08| I'm presuming that's where a majority of these comments are coming from, and I don't see a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6788.0)|
| 1:53:13| turn lane in any neighborhood all the way back to Morrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6793.0)|
| 1:53:18| I see one back to Morrell Drive, and I don't see any the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6798.0)|
| 1:53:23| There's a turn lane on Westland Drive at Sanford Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6803.0)|
| 1:53:28| Yeah, that's the only one I saw. At Gallagher View Road, there's turn lanes in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6808.0)|
| 1:53:33| But I'm seeing like nine or ten neighborhoods, and none of them have turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6813.0)|
| 1:53:38| None of them do have, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6818.0)|
| 1:53:43| I guess that's why I'm confused as to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6823.0)|
| 1:53:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6828.0)|
| 1:53:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6833.0)|
| 1:53:58| you said on their side of the property you have a 20-foot right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6838.0)|
| 1:54:03| Yes, sir. Okay, so if there was going to be a deceleration lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6843.0)|
| 1:54:08| and an acceleration lane, how much width would you have to have to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6848.0)|
| 1:54:13| to do that? I mean, lane width through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6853.0)|
| 1:54:18| for auxiliary lanes like that, we'd want to see at least 11 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6858.0)|
| 1:54:23| At least 22 feet, one for the center and one for the right-turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6863.0)|
| 1:54:28| Usually lane widths on auxiliary lanes are 11 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6868.0)|
| 1:54:37| No, I think, okay, if you're going westbound on Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6877.0)|
| 1:54:42| and you want to turn into their subdivision, okay, you would have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6882.0)|
| 1:54:47| 11 feet of road surface on their property side to do a turn lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6887.0)|
| 1:54:52| Yes, sir. For a deceleration lane, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6892.0)|
| 1:54:58| And then they'd need the same 11 feet if they're leaving the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6898.0)|
| 1:55:03| to go westbound again, turning right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6903.0)|
| 1:55:08| For an acceleration lane? Yes. Yes, I wouldn't recommend an acceleration lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6908.0)|
| 1:55:13| Most people don't know how to use those, and it's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6913.0)|
| 1:55:18| They're good on high-speed roadways, but not this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6918.0)|
| 1:55:24| But because of the limited number of units, we would not require them to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6924.0)|
| 1:55:29| We would just ask them to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6929.0)|
| 1:55:34| Based on the density that they were proposed, even at 12, I don't think that they would trip the threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6934.0)|
| 1:55:39| for a traffic impact study, so I did some just rough math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6939.0)|
| 1:55:44| made some rough assumptions, and I didn't feel as if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6944.0)|
| 1:55:49| A right-turn lane warrant is based on number of right-turners versus following vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6949.0)|
| 1:55:54| and I didn't foresee the need for a right-turn de-sale based on the number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6954.0)|
| 1:55:59| they were proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6959.0)|
| 1:56:04| But you wouldn't object if they voluntarily wanted to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6964.0)|
| 1:56:09| I'm never going to turn down free road work, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=6969.0)|

| 2:07:11| So in no way am I in favor of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7631.0)|
| 2:07:16| this property for this commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7636.0)|
| 2:07:21| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker. Commissioner Ward. I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7641.0)|
| 2:07:26| This is kind of like a pet peeve thing of mine. Where is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7646.0)|
| 2:07:31| closest area to buy groceries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7651.0)|
| 2:07:36| So I think this is a bit of a food desert area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7656.0)|
| 2:07:41| And I grew up in a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7661.0)|
| 2:07:46| You can't have access to food. It's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7666.0)|
| 2:07:51| East Knoxville in particular is a food desert, which is a major issue in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7671.0)|
| 2:07:56| So that was kind of one of my biggest concerns is this solves a food desert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7676.0)|
| 2:08:01| issue. That would be I would be for it in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7681.0)|
| 2:08:06| I think it's important that people have access to food, to affordable food. They don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7686.0)|
| 2:08:11| have to drive miles out of their way to access food. So that is one of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7691.0)|
| 2:08:16| big concerns that this is going to be on these roads can handle the traffic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7696.0)|
| 2:08:21| food. The highways right down the street. So that was my biggest concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7701.0)|
| 2:08:26| that this is a food desert area, I think, because I tried to find the nearest grocery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7706.0)|
| 2:08:31| store and I couldn't find one when I Googled it anywhere nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7711.0)|
| 2:08:36| So that was my big concern is that this would solve a food desert issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7716.0)|
| 2:08:41| Besides that, that's all my comments. Anybody has an answer to where's the closest grocery store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7721.0)|
| 2:08:46| I appreciate that, because I think it was like, I don't know, 10 miles away or something crazy like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7726.0)|
| 2:08:51| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7731.0)|

| 2:09:01| We plan our days around going to town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7741.0)|
| 2:09:06| to do grocery shopping or other outings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7746.0)|
| 2:09:11| like that. And so you do have to take into consideration the lifestyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7751.0)|
| 2:09:16| of an area as well as I appreciate what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7756.0)|
| 2:09:21| saying as far as food sources and that type of thing. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7761.0)|
| 2:09:26| you really do have to look at the lifestyles of different communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7766.0)|
| 2:09:31| And that's one thing that Advance Knots is doing. It's not just looking at sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7771.0)|
| 2:09:36| plans. It's looking at different landscapes and how people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7776.0)|
| 2:09:41| live in those areas and how do they want to preserve specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7781.0)|
| 2:09:46| landscapes or things that make their communities different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7786.0)|
| 2:09:51| So just to give you a little insight from a country girl, we plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7791.0)|
| 2:09:56| Any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7796.0)|
| 2:10:01| discussion? Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7801.0)|
| 2:10:06| Mr. Forrester, what is planned on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7806.0)|
| 2:10:11| It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7811.0)|
| 2:10:16| commercial store, non-fuel related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7816.0)|
| 2:10:21| It's a retail store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7821.0)|
| 2:10:26| Retail as in they probably will sell food there? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7826.0)|
| 2:10:31| I ask because there's nothing, we all know what's rumored to go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7831.0)|
| 2:10:36| but there's nothing in this indicating they're just asking for the zoning change, but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7836.0)|
| 2:10:41| there's no identity as to what that CA might encompass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7841.0)|
| 2:10:46| That those people own it and we'll be putting that up. I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7846.0)|
| 2:10:51| You are stating that it's going to be a dollar general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7851.0)|
| 2:10:56| type store or? Yeah, it's something similar. Something similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7856.0)|
| 2:11:01| Convenience based, but more than like a convenience store. It would be a general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7861.0)|
| 2:11:06| kind of retail food, household items, non-perishable goods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7866.0)|
| 2:11:11| some clothing, but no fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7871.0)|
| 2:11:16| Thank you. And looking at the map on that, how are you working around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7876.0)|
| 2:11:21| that one home? The layout I believe would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7881.0)|
| 2:11:26| be, if you're standing on Thorn Grove Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7886.0)|
| 2:11:31| looking at that home, the store would be to the front, kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7891.0)|
| 2:11:36| left side of that property. It's an odd shaped property. The back of the property has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7896.0)|
| 2:11:41| hillside issues and so the most appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7901.0)|
| 2:11:46| area was to the east of that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7906.0)|
| 2:11:51| It looks like you own to the east and west of that house? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7911.0)|
| 2:11:56| Like I said, it's a weird piece of property. It's like the bottom of an H around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7916.0)|
| 2:12:01| So I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7921.0)|
| 2:12:06| and I don't know how the back of that property lays, so you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7926.0)|
| 2:12:11| the development and the parking and everything will be just on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7931.0)|
| 2:12:16| of that property? Correct. You're not going to go in one side and come out the other? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7936.0)|
| 2:12:21| Okay, thank you. Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7941.0)|
| 2:12:26| I had one other question. Mr. Snowden, maybe you can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7946.0)|
| 2:12:31| If this was to be approved and they were to put a retail store there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7951.0)|
| 2:12:36| would we be requiring vegetation buffer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7956.0)|
| 2:12:41| lighting plans so that the neighbors won't be disturbed? Because I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7961.0)|
| 2:12:46| there's residential around it. The last thing I want is for them to be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7966.0)|
| 2:12:51| The zoning ordinance also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7971.0)|
| 2:12:56| codifies it in supplemental regs, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7976.0)|
| 2:13:01| Mr. Welch has brought to my attention that the planning report also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7981.0)|
| 2:13:06| requires a type B landscaping that's 12-foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7986.0)|
| 2:13:11| So there would be a requirement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7991.0)|
| 2:13:16| Okay, so it's already mandated. We don't have to make a caveat for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=7996.0)|
| 2:13:21| I was just going to add, there is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8001.0)|
| 2:13:26| so we do have in this local community, it's called the Thorn Grove community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8006.0)|

| 2:14:36| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8076.0)|
| 2:14:41| Seeing none, I'll turn it over to the District Commissioner, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8081.0)|

| 2:15:06| really good. We've had a couple of different meetings. I wasn't able to be at the last one because we were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8106.0)|
| 2:15:11| They've been very civil and very reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8111.0)|
| 2:15:16| in stating their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8116.0)|
| 2:15:21| I want to go back to what we talked about back in March when we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8121.0)|
| 2:15:26| the property down the street. We really didn't get into discussing the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8126.0)|
| 2:15:31| We discussed the points that Commissioner Schoonmaker brought up about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8131.0)|
| 2:15:36| that this area was designated for the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8136.0)|
| 2:15:41| The park was approved under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8141.0)|
| 2:15:46| stipulation that the surrounding areas would remain rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8146.0)|
| 2:15:51| And this is a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8151.0)|
| 2:15:56| The sector plan designation that put commercial overlays on these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8156.0)|
| 2:16:01| didn't take those things into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8161.0)|
| 2:16:06| For one thing, it assumed that there would be a thriving business park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8166.0)|
| 2:16:11| We've heard a lot of things that have been talked about from this body in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8171.0)|
| 2:16:16| For those reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8176.0)|
| 2:16:21| I think with an empty business park sitting there, this is a rural area that needs to remain rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8181.0)|
| 2:16:26| As the District Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8186.0)|
| 2:16:31| I really have no choice here, I don't think, but to move that we deny this rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-zoning?start=8191.0)|
