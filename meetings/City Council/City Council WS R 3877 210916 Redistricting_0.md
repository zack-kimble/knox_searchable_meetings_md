| 0:01:22| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=82)|

| 0:01:41| and so at this time I want to go ahead and turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| It's going to be the process of redistricting with legal ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| We'll start with Ms. Angie Carrier, and once you finish your presentation, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| you can just pass it off to the next person. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| Thank you for allowing MTAS to help with your redistricting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| Stephanie O'Hara and I, we have a joint presentation for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| and I just want to introduce myself. I am the Management and Finance Program Manager for the Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| and Stephanie O'Hara is the legal consultant with MTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| and I'm just going to turn it over to her and let her start with the legal ramifications for redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of Council. My name is Stephanie O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| Like she said, I'm a legal consultant with MTAS, and I've been with MTAS for about 11 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| and I serve the East Tennessee area, including the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| So outside of this, I'm still a resource if you ever need anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| But today we'll talk about redistricting, and I will go over the legal issues that might be presented during this redistricting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=164)|
| 0:02:55| So first, why are we here? Why do we have to go through this process at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| The U.S. Supreme Court held the principle of one person, one vote standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=179)|
| 0:03:09| and the holding of the court is that once the geographical unit for which a representative is to be chosen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| and that geographical area is designated, all who participate in the election are to have an equal vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| whatever their race, whatever their sex, whatever their occupation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| whatever their income, and whatever their home may be in that geographical unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| This is required under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| So if someone was going to challenge this, that's what they would challenge it under as equal protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| And this was extended by the Supreme Court in Avery versus Midland County, Texas, to local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| So that is why it applies to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| Further, the city of Knoxville includes redistricting in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| So districts shall be reportioned every 10 years based on the most recent federal census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| The council shall have prepared a redistricting ordinance providing for districts which are relatively compact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| contiguous, representative of social and community interests, and as equal in population as reasonably practicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| And this ordinance shall be adopted under your charter within 120 days of the publication of the national census of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=254)|
| 0:04:25| So one of the factors is measuring population equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| I've heard before we started, a few of you are familiar with this percentage and this range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| And so there's several steps in determining the deviation and the overall range from the ideal population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=276)|
| 0:04:44| So first you start by determining the ideal population based on the total population for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=284)|
| 0:04:52| and then dividing it by the number of districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| The ideal population under the preliminary data for your city, as prepared by your planning department, is 31,790.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=295)|
| 0:05:06| But for the purposes of my example, I'm going to use simple numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| I'm going to use an example of 10,000 as your ideal population for this example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| First you'll determine deviation, two different types of deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| First the absolute deviation and then the relative deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| So for absolute deviation, if a ward had 10,500, you would subtract the ideal population of 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=324)|
| 0:05:33| and the absolute deviation for Ward A would be 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| For Ward B, if they had 9,600, the absolute deviation would be 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| And then you determine the relative deviation, and that is a percentage instead of a whole number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| So the relative deviation for Ward A would be 500, which is the difference, divided by 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| So it's a 5% deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| And then Ward B would be negative 400 divided by 10,000, and that's a negative 4% deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| So you would need to do this for all of your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| So you'd have six different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| My example has two, but yours would have, each one of your districts would have a relative deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| You take your highest and your lowest, and that is what determines your overall range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| So for this example, if the highest is 5% and the lowest is negative 4%, your overall range is 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| If that number is less than 10%, there's a presumption of compliance with the 10% standard and equal population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=393)|
| 0:06:43| If it is greater than 10%, there's a presumption of impermissibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Before I go on, do you all have any questions about how to determine that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| Other factors that you must consider are minority representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| So under the Voting Rights Act, any voting practice that results in discrimination on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority is unlawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=422)|
| 0:07:13| So if it was challenged, a court would determine whether the protected class has been denied an equal opportunity to participate and elect candidates of its choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=433)|
| 0:07:23| This is based on the legal standard of totality of the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| It is not strictly based on percentage, but totality of the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| And other factors include block voting, history of discrimination, depressed levels of minority employment, income, and few minorities elected to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=450)|
| 0:07:39| Another factor that you must consider is racial gerrymandering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| The Supreme Court has held that although redistricting bodies may consider race when developing a redistricting plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| it cannot be the predominant reason for creating districts unless the districts are, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| So if you were, some of the factors according to your charter and other laws are compactness, continuity, respect for political subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| respect for communities of interest, protections of incumbents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| you would also add in minority representation as one of those factors, but not the primary factor in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| Your final legal consideration that I will talk to you about this evening is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| the city's charter also provides that district council members must reside in their districts for one year, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=508)|
| 0:08:37| However, if in this process, a district council member's residence ceases to be within your district because of redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| then you shall remain, continue serving for the remainder of your term until the next term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| That is not the same for all cities, but it is in your charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| And I'll turn it back over to Angie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| I'm going to go over just some steps, some practical steps of how you would start this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| and some of the things that you would consider moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| One is a redistricting committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| You have several options with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| The legislative body can appoint a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| You can be the committee yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| or you could appoint certain members of the legislative body to deal with the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| and then make a recommendation to the full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| There's a lot of things to consider with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| and I think I'll get into it a little bit later of determining which option is best for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| because you have several, but depending on what your current data is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| I think that the process could either be simple or complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| But I do recommend that there is a liaison with the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| That's very important that they're involved in the process itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| And for the purposes of redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| a chair needs to be appointed to be the main point of contact for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Step two is to collect the redistricting data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| Luckily, you already have that in your packet, the initial data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| and that is to be reviewed and evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| Things that you need to consider would be should the districts just remain the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| Does the current data show that it's okay to keep everything as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| By doing that, you would examine the population of each district as it is presently drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| and determine if the current district plan adheres to the 10% standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| which reflects in the existing numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| and then you evaluate any of the majority and minority districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| Those that have exceedingly high or low deviations is where the effort should be focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| and Stephanie just went over how those deviations come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| So those are the ones that you should probably focus your efforts on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| The next thing I would recommend is step four in drawing new district plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| This is where the legislative body as a whole needs to determine guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| for how those district lines will be drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| This is not a staff responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| They need guidelines and they need parameters in which to provide you data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| and you've got to continue with the traditional principles of the compact and contiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| Compactness is that there shouldn't be any irregular shapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| and you can look at the statistical methods for algorithms and how that is reasonably compact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=727)|
| 0:12:16| Another is the contiguous nature of it should not split into two discrete areas within one district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=736)|
| 0:12:27| and then look at methods for drawing those districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| and if there is no need to redraw districts, you could validate the data with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=752)|
| 0:12:41| recommend the city attorney to review it for compliance and approve as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| if that is the direction you would like to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| but other ways that are out there to do that is look at census blocks within the current districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| You don't want to disrupt certain census blocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| but you also could, if you wanted to start from scratch and do census blocks only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| and build up the districts themselves, that is also an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| I would suggest that, of course, all records and minutes of all the meetings that you discussed be kept in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| These are public record and things that you decide and talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| and the reason behind those minutes need to be kept in public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| I want to make sure I'm following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| So the relative deviation is all under 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| We don't have to redistrict because it's under 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Your overall range is what has to be less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| So if you had something at 8 and at negative 2, as long as it's less than 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| I mean, the ideal is to get it as close to the ideal population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| but as long as the overall range does not exceed 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| But you are fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| You are correct that you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| I just wanted to make sure that if you do make changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| it's just about the full range between the highest and lowest, not 5% above or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| So it would be from negative 4.7 to the 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Yes, the overall deviation is listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| But there are some other things to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| and I believe in 2011 city council considered to develop plans in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| One is to move the fewest people in districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Another would be with the lowest overall range as far as deviation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| and develop a plan with the highest minority representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| Those are some other factors that you consider to give guidelines to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| to look at the different districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| and then they can come up with the statistical information for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=896)|
| 0:15:06| So the next steps in that would be to complete the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=906)|
| 0:15:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Would be to complete the final plan with the consideration of the equal population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| one person, one vote, minority representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| to make sure it's compact and contiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| And then you would adopt a final plan by ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| and complete the final map and send it to the comptroller's office for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=932)|
| 0:15:40| So any questions for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| So I think way out in the left field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| but at what level are felons not counted in the votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| They're not allowed to vote, so it's not a minority population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| but it is a subsection of a population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| Is that at city level or county level or state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| It's based on population rather than your voting status, the numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| This is, I think, the third one of these I've been involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| in one capacity or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| I pulled out the 2010 census information as background for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| Nine different precincts had to be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| We had one city council district that had over a 12% deviation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| that one district alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| So like I said, moving nine precincts is pretty substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| And when I was reviewing the information that was sent over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| I mean, MPASS is a wonderful resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| I talked to Melissa Ashburn on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| She's a great person, great organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| I personally was, as far as lawyers go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| I was excited about the information because I think the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| and city council in many ways is lucky in that I don't think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| anything compelling a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| I mean, we've had these boundaries, or we've had these districts for 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| and as far as I know, and Mr. Swanson's back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| no one has filed suit alleging anything is out of sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| This might be the luck of the draw for this 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| But MPASS can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| but I'm not sure there's any compelling reason to form committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| to think about moving around precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1077)|
| 0:18:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Any other questions or comments so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Oh, Council Member Smith, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| There was reference to having staff review the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| or review the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| Is that MPASS staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| You're planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| You have experts on staff, fortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| Most cities don't have that resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| but they can prepare all of the data and the measurements of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| there's compliance with each of those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| You have that in your planning team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1114)|
| 0:18:46| Council, any other questions or discussions so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| We're ready to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Vice Mayor, or does anybody know if the planning staff has looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| yet, or is that something that we would need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| We're going to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| I'll be patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Councilwoman Ryder, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| So, of note, the relative deviation for each district is quite minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| So, it's all within, not just within the acceptable margins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| but very low in the acceptable margins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Would that be a fair statement to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Because it looks like nobody's up to 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| It meets the 10% standard, and then it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| they are all less than 5% from the total, I'm sorry, the ideal population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| And last time, 10 years ago, it was substantially different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| and there was quite a bit of shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Your initial data, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| I just will say I think it's quite confusing to people to get shifted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| around from district to district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| So, it would need merit and warrant for us to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| lest we continue to confuse the populace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Most people don't know which district they live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| and I know parts of the 5th district that I visited in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| and parts of the 4th district, people were greatly confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| because in previous elections, they were in different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| So, I know how confusing it can be for people to get moved around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| And I think also in Mr. Frost's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| he actually confirmed that information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| So, very good, and I think it's going to be really important that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| able to have a communication plan to our constituents and our districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| to help them understand that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| So, if there's no further conversation or questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1246)|

| 0:21:01| Good afternoon, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| So, staff of Knoxville and Knox County Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| we've evaluated the decennial population data released a few weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| from the U.S. Census Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| This is the full census that was completed in April of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| This is the decennial census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| It's once every 10 years that they do this degree of surveying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Its intended goal was to be a 100% survey of the United States population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| It's the most detailed and comprehensive survey that they conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| An important purpose of which is to ensure equal representation in federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| state, and local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| So, tonight's presentation, I'm going to focus on the Census Bureau's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| redistricting data set, and keep in mind that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| this is a fairly limited set of measures that they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| You're not going to find the details on housing or income or education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| or poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| What you will get out of this is the core decision-making data for a sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| redistricting plan, and that's going to be total population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| population by race, population by voting age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| and folks that live in group quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| This information serves as the statistical foundation for the redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| decisions that you're going to make here in the next few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| or the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| So, let me present for your consideration the conditions, trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| and outcomes of the 2020 Census redistricting data set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| Knoxville's 2020 total population count is 190,740.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| By council district, the population ranges from a high of just over 33,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1360)|

| 0:22:50| But generally speaking, that's not a very wide spread from district to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| We're pretty evenly distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| Here's a map showing the location of our population across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| It's a density map, so we looked at very small geographic areas of census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| blocks and we calculated the number of people per square mile in each of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| those blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| The lighter color shades are the less dense areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| The darker color shades have more people per square mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| It may be hard to see up there but there's really the darkest shade would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| be found in Fort Sanders area, so it's pushing 17,000 people per square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| mile in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| And there are a few other really high density areas sprinkled around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| Lowest density can be found in the commercial and industrial oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| areas, not a lot of residential mix in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| And you can see a lot of those tend to fall along the major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| transportation corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1428)|

| 0:24:11| The flat trend line between 1970 and 1980, that was a no change in the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| It stayed steady at about 175,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| 1990 saw a pretty dramatic change, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| We saw an actual loss of population, went from 175 down to 169.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| That's a loss of 6,000 people in that 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Interestingly, when the census released that data set in 1990, their count for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| the city was actually 165,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| So that dip was even greater down to the bottom axis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| At the time, former Mayor Ash, he was convinced that there had to be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| with undercount during that census and he appealed the census number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| He did so by sending out planning staff, off-duty law enforcement and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| We went around and we recounted parts of the city counting housing units and as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| a result of that appeal, we were able to add 4,000 more people to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| population, thus the 169.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1515)|

| 0:25:27| But then the last 10 years are the more interesting story and that's where we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| seen accelerated growth, which has brought us to 190,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| Interesting note about the recent growth in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Maybe a little hard to see up there but not only has the city's population grown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| but what it has done, it has captured a larger share of the county-wide growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| So during the 2000s, the city share of county-wide growth only comprised 10% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1550)|

| 0:26:00| But a very difference since 2010, here in the city we've captured 25% of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| the county's growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| So two and a half times more of the county-wide growth has actually occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1567)|

| 0:27:23| very stable neighborhoods, haven't seen a lot of people leave or come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Then lastly, the blue tracts, that's where the growth has been occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Dark blue, again, in the Fort Sanders downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| And we've also seen some pretty high growth in Fountain City, UT campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| and the south waterfront are other examples of growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| So population changed by the council district between 2010 and 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| We've seen citywide growth of just shy of 12,000 people or about a 6.6% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| And just by comparison, the previous decade, 2000 to 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| our growth rate was only 2.9% in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| So we've more than doubled our growth rate here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Fastest growth is in the second district, up a little over 4,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| And slowest growth, modest increase of 643 people in the sixth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| representing about a 2.2% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Growth rates among the remaining districts, they did not vary too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| from the citywide average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| So I want to take a closer look now at Knoxville's population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| with an examination of some of the demographic characters of race and ethnicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| From this table, you can see that the white population comprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| nearly a 70% share of the total, with black or African American population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| representing the second largest group at about 16% share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| The remainder of the population is comprised of the other race categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| shown in the table, and they combine for about 15% of the total population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| The largest of the other groupings is the two or more races category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| As you can see, there are over almost 14,000 people that self-identify as multiracial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| and that share of the population total, 7.3%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| was a dramatic increase from the 2010 census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| Hispanic or Latino population represents nearly an 8% share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| Just for clarification, this is a census thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| I don't have a good explanation or understanding of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| but census reports Hispanic or Latino folks as an ethnic group, not a racial group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| So they're not added in the calculation of shares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| to come up with 100% share of the total population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| but they do represent almost 8% of the city's overall population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| And much like the multi-race group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Hispanic or Latino has grown quite substantially in the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| The headlines coming out of the latest census, as I was saying in the release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| they reveal that we are growing more diverse locally and across the state and the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| The racial ethnic minority share of the population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| especially those in the two or more races and Hispanic or Latino categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| are leading that charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| In 2010, racial minority population comprised just 24% of the city's total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| That share has now grown to almost over 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| So we've gone from about 25, a quarter of the population as a racial minority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| up to almost a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Black or African-American population in the city was virtually unchanged in the past 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| but it did lose a percentage point in its total share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| I've got some maps here to share with you now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| that show where our racial minority populations are distributed across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| First up is the Black or African-American population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| Much of the 6th District east of downtown and south of I-40, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| are heavy concentrations as shown on the map of Black and African-American population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| We also see some concentrated communities comprising the Beaumont and Lonsdale communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| as well as the corridor along the south side of I-640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| And in those locales, we're seeing shares of population reaching anywhere from 20% to 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| of the little neighborhood blocks that have Black or African-American population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| Throughout the rest of the city, we see anywhere a range of between 6% and 20% shares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| of Black or African population pretty widely distributed elsewhere across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1909)|
| 0:31:57| Among Asian, Native American, Alaska Native, Pacific Highlander, Native Hawaiian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| and other races, this map shows their distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| By comparison to the Black or African-American population and the multiracial groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| these don't comprise a great number of our local population, but these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| as you can see from the distribution, are well distributed across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| with some notable exceptions in South Knoxville, as well as Holston Hills, Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| and the Bearden, Westmoreland, Dean Hill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| This map is a summary depiction of the racial minority population across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| Since much of the racial minority population is comprised of the Black or African-American residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| it's not too surprising that the trend, the pattern you see on this map is very closely reflective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| of that of the Black or African-American map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| However, I think one notable difference is the much more widespread of other racial minority population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| and again, that's driven by the multiracial folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| Then lastly, the Hispanic or Latino population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| It's mostly evenly distributed throughout the central city and the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| with some notable higher density pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| And then again, like multiracial population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Knoxville saw considerable growth in the Hispanic or Latino folks here in the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2008)|
| 0:33:38| So now that we know what the population looks like, we need to talk about its role in local redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| Again, I just want to remind you that one of the core functions of the decennial census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| is to inform the redistricting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| That's why we wanted to spend a decent amount of time this evening understanding who our people are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| how many folks live here, where they live, what is their racial complexion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| This is very core and important information to the decisions that you're going to make here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| I have four slides here that I think are fairly redundant to what was already covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| so I'm going to skip through them because I also put together the definitions of ideal population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| absolute deviation, relative deviation, and then the overall deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| So I'm going to just jump right on into our local conditions, local situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2065)|
| 0:34:33| Twenty-twenty ideal population for each of Knoxville's districts is 31,900 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| Absolute deviation column on this table shows how different each district population is from the ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| And again, the relative deviation column expresses that as a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| The smallest or most negative relative deviation is in the 6th district at negative 4.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| So what that means is the absolute deviation in that district is negative 1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| In order for District 6 to approach the more ideal population, 1,500 people need to be added to the 6th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2103)|
| 0:35:12| So that's what that number means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| The largest or most positive relative deviation is in the 2nd district at 3.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| That means that they actually exceed the ideal population, and that number is about 1,223 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2120)|
| 0:35:29| So if you wanted to achieve the perfect ideal number of 31,790,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| we would have to move 1,223 people out of the 2nd district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| Then the overall deviation is 8.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Rounded up, it's actually 8.57%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| And as we know, as our MTAS folks have just explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| one metric for a defensible redistricting plan is an overall deviation less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| We are compliant with that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| Another metric for consideration is racial minority population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| You have that table in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| I know it's probably impossible for you to read from where you are, but you should have a hard copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| I'll go through it under the impression that you have the ability to read some of these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| As I already mentioned, the Voting Rights Act protects minority voters against discriminatory voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| and to equalize electoral opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| So legislative bodies must consider minority representation when developing district plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| Also from the Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| majority minority districts occur when an ethnic or language minority group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| has the largest percentage of the total population in a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| In past redistricting efforts, and this is my fourth go-round for both city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| one of the stated goals in each of those past efforts was preservation of at least one majority minority district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| So locally, District 6 is comprised of a 43.6% share of black or African American population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| and a total minority share of 57.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| Again, it is compliant with a potential criterion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| Again, I'd have to defer to the experts, but it does preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| if this were a goal of this group, to preserve a minority minority district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| then District 6 meets that criterion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| Additional requirements for a successful and defensible redistricting plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| are compact and contiguous districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| So regarding contiguity, this was already mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| but again, you can't have a district that's split into two or more pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Knoxville has no such situation. We are fully compliant with the contiguity requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| Regarding compactness, the redistricting guide states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| that compactness is most easily understood in terms of a district's shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| Violation of this principle results in districts with irregular shapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| better known as gerrymandering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Redistricting principle of reasonably compact may be somewhat subjective in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| But to combat that, we all have tools at our disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| We need to use acceptable statistical methods as well as geographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| and population considerations to measure compactness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| We at Planning, when we assembled this table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| we employed a well-used and well-defended methodology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| called the convex hull method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| So these numbers weren't just pulled out of a hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| They are statistically derived from a sound model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| So I'm going to show you a little bit about how we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| But before I do that, I guess I just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Districts 6 and 5 and 3 have some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| I'm not an expert on compactness, but to me, those numbers are pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| Where we see some challenges are Districts 2 and 4 in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| And I'm going to show you a reason for that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| So this is a graphic depicting the convex hull model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| This model has also been called the string method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| because it can be visualized as wrapping a string around a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| and measuring the area of the shape formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| So what it means is, let's say for District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| you can see the light green string wrapping around the shape of District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| Its compactness is measured by calculating the real area of District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| And we can do that with our computer modeling software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| And then it also looks at the total area that's inside that string.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| So you divide the real area divided by the string area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| and that gives you your percent compactness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| So District 6 is actually, like I said, it's like 63% compact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| District 5 is another strongly compact district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| Where we run into trouble, as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| are those outlying districts like 1, 2, and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| And the issue with those, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| are all those tentacles that extend outside of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| They create a huge string polygon to encompass all of those tentacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| So for D2, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| if you measure just the actual land area comprising that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| it's nowhere near as large as the area of the polygon that has to encompass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| And that's what drives the low compactness figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| You all will have to evaluate those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| but I don't want to weigh in on opinions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| It's not my role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Those are challenges that I don't know that can be overcome in a compactness measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| I'm going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| I kind of hinted at this just a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| So planning, Knoxville-Knox County planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| we see that we have a role here to play if you so choose to invite us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| and we have some resources that we can share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| So in the past, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| this is my personal fourth time around in a redistricting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| We have other staff that work with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| They've done two or three as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| So anyway, our role, we have the data, the software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| and the technical expertise to help you all, the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| develop successful plan solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| We have data collection, analysis, reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| and operation of custom redistricting mapping software all among our skill sets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| We provide objective and quantitative solution analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| We play no role in evaluating plan alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| or in the outcome of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| So some of the resources that we have at your disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| we have all the population data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| We have it by any different geography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| so we have it by voting precinct, census tract, census block and block group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| We've already collected all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| It was released on August 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| We've already collected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| We've got software to draw and evaluate redistricting solution alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| And then lastly, we have currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| we have already developed maps of the districts showing the precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| precincts population, and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| And before I wrap up, I'm more than happy to show you one of those maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| It's kind of, it's a little hard to take in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| but I just want to show it to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| just because I want you to know that we have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| and they can be printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| Did I do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Am I not supposed to leave a PowerPoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| All right, I'll go back to my PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Just let me say that we have these map resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| They're large format documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| We print them off on about 36 by 48-inch sheets of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| and it will show all the district boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| then nested inside the district boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| it's got all the precinct boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| and labeled on each precinct is the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| So if you are so inclined to take one of these maps at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| and want to see if you can make some tweaks to the redistricting plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| you have all that information at your disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2616)|
| 0:43:44| So lastly, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Again, I just want to reiterate how important the census data is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| to this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| and I am happy to entertain any questions you might have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| and share any data at your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Thank you for that overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| It was really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| You mentioned it would be hard to overcome the compactness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| because of the annexation tentacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| What are some tradeoffs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| How should we consider compactness in the grand scheme of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| We're thinking about population mostly and race and ethnicity as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| Compactness, I'm not sure what the tradeoffs are for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| given our current structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| Well, this is probably a better answer by the MTAS folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| but my short answer would be that compactness is just one of several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| decision-making criteria that you as a committee will determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| as essential to a successful redistricting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| If you put less weight on the compactness component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| that's your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| I will say that it's an important consideration by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| but given that these district boundaries are unchanged from what were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| approved in 2011, I don't know that new administration at the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| would take exception to this type of compactness or maybe they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| well, this was successful in 2011, maybe it's successful in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| That will be up to you and in consultation with MTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| I guess for MTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| is there any known risks associated with the skewed compactness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| Based on the data that you have now, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| he said that it was approved, obviously, the last time around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| so that might be one indication that it would be acceptable by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| I would consider if you do decide to move some of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| move the district lines, how it does impact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| and if it changes it to a detriment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| that might be a reason not to make any changes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| I'm not going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| I don't want to issue opinion that this would be acceptable because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| think that's a determination by the state and I would honestly defer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| your city attorney, whether they agree, city attorney's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| whether they agree that the compactness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| at the state level is who would determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| And they've already, they've approved it at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| but you should look at it if you do decide to move district lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| And if it does make any changes to that, the compactness at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2785)|
| 0:46:36| So I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| So just in looking at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| the district map that you have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| And so just thinking out loud about district six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| So where we see district four coming in the outline that you have there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| in blue of district six where it kind of dips in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| we'd have to look at if we were considering to redistrict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| we'd have to look at that precinct to see how many people are in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| precinct, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| To see whether or not it would, it would shave out some of that 1500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| That's somewhat of a deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| I guess one way you look at it with the goal, if we were to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| if we were to counsel, decide to go down that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| would we be looking at trying to diminish that total 1500 or just balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| a little bit more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| If that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| I believe that that is your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| that is a question for this body of whether you would want to get closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| to zero for your deviations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Getting to zero is almost nearly impossible, but you, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| there is a factor that you could get closer, but there are the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| all the other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| If you do move someone, one of the precincts into district six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| what does it do to the minority population in that district at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| And then what does it do to compactness and continuity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| You need, you have to look through all the factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| So if you move it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| then you reevaluate the data based on those factors as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| So kind of cause and effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| So it's nothing simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| There's always going to be some things that will have some ripple effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| If you make any moves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| So those are, I mean, that's why it's only one of the factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| Continuity is only one of the factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Compactness is only one of the factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| And if you give, if you want to explore moving any of these district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| I would ask your planning staff to give them a list of criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| including those to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Moving the fewest number of people can be one of them keeping incumbents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| in, in their districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| It can also be more other factors for you can just consider and to direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| for presentation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Do we know what the deviation was in 2010?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| It was 8.5, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| 8.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Do we know specifically what district six was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| District six was I think like 12.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| So that was, that's what precipitated the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| the precinct changes in 2010 because of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| So it was 8.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| So in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| the overall range of the successful solution was 7.99 or 8.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| The largest positive deviation was in the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| almost 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| And the largest negative deviation was in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| So first district had to move several people out and five had to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| Except, can I, can I comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Just off the top of my head, I know that it was like a domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| So I know precinct 16 moved from the fifth to the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| So you must have moved something else to get that population up in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| fifth because you moved a sizable precinct into the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| So that was the big change in the fourth district was precinct 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Domino effect or ripple effect are good ways to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| So wasn't it just two that got changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| There were nine changes to make those offices work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| In my experience, as soon as you move a precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| it becomes very, very challenging to keep close to the ideal population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| You may move a precinct in the center city and it may have a negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| impact out in district two because it does have a ripple effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| I've found that that is the most challenging part of the redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| process is maintaining the proximity to the ideal population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| That's just my personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| Each decade it's a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| Any additional questions or conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3074)|
| 0:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| I know that we have Rick Emmett here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| We just want to thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| I know you've been very helpful with the census process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| and also sharing information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| So thank you for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Do you have any comments or anything that you'd like to make since you're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Mr. Frost, any additional closing comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| I mean, I guess at this point the council needs to decide next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| If at some point Mr. Swanson doesn't something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| a resolution is placed on the council agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| it has to be done by the end of this calendar year, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| So do we make that decision at this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| Council Member Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Was even if as a body we decided not to redistrict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| does it still require that we establish a committee to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| Or, again, I guess next steps was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| And that's where once you evaluate the current data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| that's where that step would come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| If the legislative body would like to move forward as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| you could do that and adopt it and move forward without going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| establishing a committee and evaluating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| There can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| This is a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| It's not a called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| So there can be no binding votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| You know, there could be a straw poll if somebody wants to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| well, I think we need to do a committee, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| where someone can say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| I think we need to request the administration to put this on an upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| council agenda for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| So that might be a good topic to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3199)|
| 0:53:29| Council Member Testament and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| I would just reiterate Councilwoman Ryer comment that she said early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| about just the confusion as it stands with districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| and people not always understanding what district they are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| and the confusion that it really causes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| in trying to educate people who the representatives are in the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| and the issues and the needs of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| So I would concur with her on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Yeah, I guess based on everything I've heard, I would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| I would suggest we leave the districts as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| It seems that the folks in 2010 did a pretty good job with the crystal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| ball and a lot of good data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| I do want to make sure we leave room for the council members who aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| here to have time for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| I don't know if that allows us to put it on a subsequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| council meeting agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| but I do think that folks who aren't here should have time to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| Well, if our guest presenters have the flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| maybe we could just schedule a Zoom call or something with the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| members that were not able to attend today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| I don't know if it would be appropriate to also make that open for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| public to listen in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| If a council member had questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I'm sure they could have a one-on-one conversation with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| And then you wouldn't have any open meetings issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| Because not everyone, some might have different questions or no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| And so just following on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| let's assume that those council members do have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| they meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| Typically, how would we reconvene on the matter at a council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3328)|
| 0:55:37| Yes, if anyone would like to contact us and we can talk one-on-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| meet any time with anyone that's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| That extends to any of you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| So if you come up with questions after this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| if you're looking over your packet and you have more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| we'll be happy to answer any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| And we provided the PowerPoint to Angela,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| and she can distribute that to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| There were several slides I think that would be very important in helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| people understand the process and why or why not we may make a decision not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| to do any redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| Also, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| some people are going to have some confusion regarding the city districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| versus the county districts versus the state districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| And so I think that it's going to be in all of our best interest to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| sure that we're clear as it relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| And since the sixth district is a district that has the deviation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| I think that's highest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| I do want to make sure that my constituents are educated on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| information that we shared tonight for those that may not have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| So I think the PowerPoint will be extremely helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Just generally speaking from a timing standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I guess we'll call this a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| Does October 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| Well, this would be put on the agenda by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| I don't know what other steps they would need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| I guess before I ask that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| just generally to council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| is October 5th sufficient time for council members who aren't here to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| questions and meet with these folks and for us to meet with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| The 5th sounds like it's right around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| So maybe push out just a little bit further in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| What would be after the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| That would be the 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| I think the 19th should give everyone more than enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| And remind me when our deadline is again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| I believe it's December 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| We will make a note to look at having this on our council agenda on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| October 19th for discussion and hopefully vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210916-redistricting?start=3499)|
