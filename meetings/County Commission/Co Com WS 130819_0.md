| 0:00:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=23)|
| 0:00:23| First, Dr. Briggs, would you lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=23)|

| 0:00:36| and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=36)|

| 0:00:53| You know the voice of honor aired in a little bit in everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=53)|

| 0:01:41| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=101)|

| 0:01:47| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| We have ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| On amendments to the agenda, I, of course, just want to remind the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=114)|
| 0:02:02| that we have the retirement agreement which you've been handed out from Mr. Walls as an added item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=122)|
| 0:02:13| item 44, and the recommendation from the Audit Committee was withdrawn, item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=133)|
| 0:02:26| We'd like also to move items 37 and 45 regarding the pension issues to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=146)|
| 0:02:38| And if necessary, the property assessor item also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| But I'm going to put those on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| So if they go through consent, we'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| I haven't said consent, but the property assessor tax rate items, if there's no questions there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| I'm going to attempt to put them on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=192)|
| 0:03:23| That's an add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Commissioner Schaust, are we at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| What are we doing now about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| I guess we just need to put that as a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| Be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| We have a we need to discuss an audit issue in addition to the current internal auditor about some potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=218)|
| 0:03:48| extra work from Pew and Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| So we'll have someone here and I would like to make sure we discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| And Chris, I say we have something to add also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| So we'll add that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Additional audit issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| We need to defer 110 and withdraw 809.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=245)|
| 0:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| If I may, I know we usually don't move anything like discussion up on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| but if you wanted to move up that, if you have some comments for Larry Elmore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| that may would be positive because I think as he sits here he's not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| We'll move that item forward also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| We'll just make it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| I would like to add items 25 and 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| One is women, infants, and children funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| The other is funding for Project Diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| If I could, for what I want to assure commission is the last time I'd like to defer 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| items 20, 21, and 22 related to utility contracts and Bob Gray roundabout construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=319)|
| 0:05:27| And if we could also we would like to add Resolution 13-8405, which I believe has been distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| And it's a simple contract amendment to a TDOT contract for turn lanes at Westland and Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=334)|
| 0:05:43| And I should probably also just say a word of thanks to Ms. Rosberg because she's we've kept her busy this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| and I really appreciate her help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| We're always thanking Ms. Rosberg, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| For consent, and that's including some of these changes that have just been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| have items 4, 5, 7 through 13, 15 through 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=373)|
| 0:06:38| And that block of 28 to 34, all of those are, I was told, negotiated contracts at appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=398)|
| 0:06:50| I think that purchasing agreed to, just for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=410)|
| 0:06:59| And then 38, 39, and 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=419)|
| 0:07:12| That's all I have for consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=432)|
| 0:07:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Any changes to the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| We have a motion to approve consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=455)|

| 0:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Let's hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=476)|
| 0:07:56| Can I hear a motion to add, defer, which are all necessary items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Clerk, could we start with the discussion item on the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=494)|
| 0:08:26| And Mr. Elmore, if you'd come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| My name is Larry Elmore with Pew CPAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| Home address is 1634 Wembley Hill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Thank you, Mr. Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Mr. Shouse, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| I'll preface this briefly in light of very obvious and public improprieties in the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| one which culminated, I guess, in the resignation of Mr. Duncan on July 3rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| and another one a few years prior to that, which goes to employees, improper invoices paid and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=542)|
| 0:09:11| I guess Caldwell initiated a conversation with Mr. Elmore, with Pew and company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| to what would be some safeguards we could put in place to insure, I guess it's not impossible to totally insure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| but to virtually insure these never do not happen again on our watch or any watch going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| And Mr. Elmore presented the proposal to the Audit Committee last week for specific areas that he would address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| and the cost associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| And the cost is not prohibitive, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| But, nevertheless, the Commissioner Brawls and I and myself thought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| and other members of the Audit Committee, I assume, thought it pertinent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| and important that the entire commission hear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| And hopefully we'll feel reassured that the county is on top of what's going on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| and we'll approve or at least know of this possible expenditure or likely expenditure if we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=607)|
| 0:10:17| So you want to address that, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I've got your letter here about the payroll walk-through, the accounts payables walk-through and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| Do the other commissioners have a copy of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| I don't think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I just happen to have mine in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| I'll make sure it's emailed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| One little additional bit of information is when Chris asked me to put this proposal together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| he had gotten a call from one of the bonding companies who was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| this was happening all during the time of trying to obtain the bonding on the new trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| or actually the interim trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| And one of the issues or one of the questions raised by the bonding company at that time was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| what could you do or what could your auditors do for us to give us a little bit more assurance about whether this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| could happen again, especially with the two different terms of trustee having issues such as they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=662)|
| 0:11:11| And so we tried to come up with some procedures that would address the actual things that happened in those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| One of them being the issue of having employees or payees, vendors or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| that were not necessarily actual employees working on a day-to-day basis in the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| or vendors that were valid people that were getting payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| So in that particular case, we came up with some procedures to test payroll, the disbursements of payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=696)|
| 0:11:44| looking at time records, looking at going and coming from inside the building to make sure people were reporting to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| Some of these being done on a surprise basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| And also looking at unusual payments such as vacation buyouts, comp time payouts, bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| those unusual types of things that were going through payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| And then in the second case where there was disbursements for things that were being paid for that maybe didn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=728)|
| 0:12:18| we would look at payouts other than just payroll to look at some things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| In addition, we would do walkthroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| A walkthrough just means that you would actually take some transactions and start from cradle to grave, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| as far as how it gets initiated, how it gets approved, how it gets paid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| Walkthrough and accounts payable, also payroll, test of payroll records, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| Interview some employees in the trustee's office as far as questioning them as far as things that might be going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| within the office, rumors that they might have heard, those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| There's a page of steps here that we'll be performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| There again, I think if I'm not mistaken that Chris told me when the bond was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| they assumed that the bonding insurance company assumes that these are going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| The question is, and my letter addresses this, it could be done by us or your internal audit staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| We're proposing that it be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| If we do it, we've quoted, if you do it all at one time, it would cost about $8,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=798)|
| 0:13:26| if you make one trip and do all these steps at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| I think the better way to do it would be four different trips, at least four different trips, for a total of about $12,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| and even do some of them on a surprise basis where the employees wouldn't necessarily know what day you were coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| or when you were going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| So we can do it either way or you can have your internal audit staff do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=825)|
| 0:13:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you, Mr. O'Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| I move that we send this on with no recommendation to the commission meeting until we get the information in our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=841)|
| 0:14:11| Okay, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| The phase that we're at right now is discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| There is nothing to forward to the full commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| The four steps that were delineated, I'm in complete agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| In fact, I even go so far as to say having one step every quarter and it being unannounced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| even being a better deal than doing it all at one particular time in any particular month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| The concern that I have is the audit committee is a subset of full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| and we need to discuss it here at full commission and we can say in our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| I think that we fully support this and that a resolution be brought either later this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| or that the contract be amended and we have that resolution before us at a subsequent meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=897)|
| 0:15:05| Either of those paths to me are okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| It's just the fact we need to discuss it today and make sure that full commission understands the gravity of the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| that faces us coming out of that office and being bonded at this office change in leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=913)|
| 0:15:21| and that there are two separate things that were before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| One, we will eventually receive a bill related to that cutoff and transfer of leadership in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=924)|
| 0:15:33| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| That's already occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| It happened on a short stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| I applaud the administration for stepping forward and getting that audit performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| There's no other way we could do it than just to say it needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| What we have before us in this second change to the contract is a request that there be four steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| how they'd be done, and it's to help us ensure to the bonding company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| and to the people that give us a bond rating that we're doing our best to make sure this office operates in the full graces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=958)|
| 0:16:06| of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| If I could say one more thing, these steps here are designed to be more of a preventive type measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| And I say in my letter here that there's really not enough you can do to keep it from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| There's no guarantee that it won't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| Some of these are designed to just put the employees in that particular department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| or that particular office on notice that there's some checks and balances going on just as a preventative type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| There's also some things, as Commissioner Wright said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| there's also some things that had to be done that would be required to be done that we've already gone through with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| And there's also the work that we've been doing at the request of the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| to follow up on the findings we had last year in the trustee's office related to the late completion of the monthly bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1010)|
| 0:17:00| reconciliations and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Those have to be done just as an audit requirement when you have those kinds of issues going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| This particular one is more of a preventive type measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| I'm all in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| And I think that we can fund it when and if Mr. Hahn ever pays us back the 100,000 plus dollars that he owes us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| I think that we can fund it from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| And that would be a nice thing, I think, to fund to make sure that this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| Mr. Earl, let me ask Chris Caldwell a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Mr. Caldwell, which offices go through Knox County payroll and which do not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| It was my understanding that at that time trustees' office did not go through Knox County payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| They had their own payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| They did at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| They now go through our payroll department, as does all fee offices now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| So there's no one out there that does not go through Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| I do not believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| I'll double check that, but I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| Good, because I wanted to say that if there were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| I would like to include them in this as well to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| but if they're all going through Knox County payroll, then that's one area where it can be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| But I'm in total support of this, and I think we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| If I may say, Mr. Chairman, as Larry did this preparation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| the mayor was in full agreement, as was I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| And then as Trustee Luthold came in, we went over it with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| and he said he wanted it done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| So anything to be proactive is a positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Mr. Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| When Chris brought me the letter that Larry had written with these recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| I approved of them wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| I just think it's something that this office is going to need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Like I said, you know, we're building trust one day at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| and we're going to make sure that we do everything correct today, and when we come back tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| we're going to do it the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| We're going to do it by the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| And anything that we can do to help Larry with his audit, we've already extended our help to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1155)|
| 0:19:24| and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that when they come and examine our books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| that they're ready to be audited and that any other recommendations that he have, we're going to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| So I just want to let you all know that, and that's the way we're going to run this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Anything else, Mr. Elmore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| So, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| It looks as though full commission's in agreement that we're going to implement this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| and pay the bill whenever we get to it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| That's what it appears to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| But there's been no decision voted on as to which one of these options we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| Are you going to do that in discussion or are you going to defer it and do it at the full meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1207)|
| 0:20:15| It looks like there's a sentiment towards the full meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| When I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Full meeting's fine, but I would hope we would look seriously at the periodic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| and particularly that gives Larry the ability to drop in without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| and I'm not saying there's anything going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| but just he emphasized last week when he drops in unannounced is when things may be, he may find things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1232)|
| 0:20:43| Hopefully he won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| But that's, I think that's err on the side of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| So then maybe I need to rephrase my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| I believe that the discussion that we're having today leads itself to the fact that we will do these four things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| and four separate inspections quarterly, not the four things total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| but one of these four things every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| And the external auditor understands from us that we're going to get to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| and that the law department will present that to us in substantive form so that we can vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| whether it be this week or in the month to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| We will follow what we are discussing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| That's the question that's before us because I believe the external auditor and the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| and more especially the trustee, needs to know we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1294)|
| 0:21:41| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| The contract that the county has with Pew and Company does allow for certain agreed upon procedures to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| I think it's out of an abundance of caution that we go ahead and let the commission vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| I would say as far as the amount goes, $8,000 to $12,000, we do usually put some added cushion into the auditing budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1317)|
| 0:22:07| knowing things like this come up so this would not hinder and require a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1327)|
| 0:22:18| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Well, then, if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| then we need to have a vote to put it on next week as a voting item rather than just add it to the agenda next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1342)|
| 0:22:33| Why can't we just make a motion today to say this is what we want done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| And I totally agree with the four-year rather than trying to do it all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| So, if it needs a motion, I'll make the motion that we put it on the agenda to vote on next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1365)|
| 0:22:56| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| No, Mr. Chairman, we've gone down this road before about discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| We do not vote on discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| I think this is just we can add it to the agenda Monday, write it up, add it to the agenda Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| The same thing is going to happen, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| But this pulling things from discussion and just haphazardly voting on them, I agree with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1395)|
| 0:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Other things on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| On page 10, item number 37, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1414)|
| 0:23:42| of the Sheriff's Total Accumulation Retirement Plan, star, adoption of Knox County Employee Disability Benefit Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| 2014 amendment and reinstatement of Knox County Employee Benefit System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| and 2014 amendment and reinstatement of Uniformed Officers Pension Plan Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Well, you know, I don't have any questions, but I think those of us that were on the committee are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| and it's Mr. Shouse and myself and I think Nick McBride is out there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| He was at all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| So I strongly encourage everyone to go ahead and vote for it unless we have some particular questions or issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| Okay, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| And thanks to Kim, all her staff, and Nick, all these people who have been working on this in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| I also would like to praise Ms. Kim and her staff for the great work they did on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| But I think this is, you know, this is the important thing for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| And I think anybody in the audience, whether it's not that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| or whether you're just a layperson sitting out there and you have any concerns or questions on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| now is the time to bring them forward because I think they're ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| and I think they're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| Mr. Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| I was just going to add, this is the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| It's the plan that the document committee, which is a subcommittee of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| worked and probably had about 20 meetings and hammered it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| It was sometimes controversial and we think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| I think it's we haven't heard an outcry of opposition to it from the uniforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| nor have we had an outcry of, or I haven't anyway, of opposition from the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| So if we can, you know, split in the difference, it's pretty hard to do in this game, in this environment sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| I think it's a great plan and I think it puts Knox County ahead of the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| There's still a majority of the cities and counties out there in the world have, in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| have defined benefit plans, but every day many of them are going to a defined contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| which is what we're doing, frankly, at the direction of the voters from last November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| So I urge support of it and I'm glad it's where we've come to it, we've come to this point now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Any other discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| On page 12, item number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee amending Chapter 2 of the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| by adding a new Article 14 entitled, Knox County Retirement and Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| to establish an in-line of duty disability benefits for eligible Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| Knox County Code Chapter 2 establishing a new Article 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| This is Ordinance O-13-8-101 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1608)|
| 0:26:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you to the pension representatives and we've cut our costs a little bit today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1626)|
| 0:27:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1634)|
| 0:27:23| Okay, on page 4, item number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| approving a contract in the amount of $2,999,170 with KNF Construction Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| for the construction of additions and renovations to Shannondale Elementary School Resolution 208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| This is an item that I would respectfully suggest belongs on the education consent agenda for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| To make it consistent with our court-supervised consent agreement between the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| and the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| By the way, we're excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| It's Shannondale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| It's an addition that will add about 14 classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| allowing us to get out of the portable classrooms that are on that campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| painting, sprinkling the building, renovation of a new media center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| expansion of the cafeteria, and also installation of an elevator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| So a great project, but I believe it belongs on education consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| It's just simply a numerical mistake there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| We still got a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| A motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Okay, motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| On page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| Item number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| designating, committing, and appropriating funds in the total amount of $4,186,333.76| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1747)|
| 0:29:16| for fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014 for various funds and departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| Not funded under current budget resolution 808.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| There might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Do you want this to go without recommendation, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| What I would prefer is to send it without recommendation until Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| and we'll give you a complete listing then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| There will be some things that we have to add as we try to close out our fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| and close out some funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| I know you have a discussion on your agenda that we're talking about SHAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| and we can talk about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| That's going to end up being on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| And a couple more minor things, but we know we need to take care of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| I'm a broken record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Health insurance is a big issue that we need to address through designations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| and we need to look at our risk management fund and our air quality fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| and we're going to look at those this week and determine an amount that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| to put on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| Or what we could do in certain situations is fund it through current year and FY13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| which would just lower our surplus amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| It's all, in the end, it's all the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| It's just the timing of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| We cannot end the year and have a fund to be in the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| And so we just need to look at that and get a better handle as we're still getting ARN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| And I guess last week we stopped taking any type of payables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| And so I would just prefer no recommendation for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| You can look at that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| We'll give you an updated list on Friday, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| and we'll highlight what those changes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| And that will be a more complete list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Change my motion to no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| While we have you, why don't you talk about SHAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| and we can kind of dispose of that discussion while we've got you here talking about designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| So well aware that they have had the commission over to their place to talk about funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| I guess, in the past month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| They also had a discussion with the mayor and myself during the budget process about what we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1883)|
| 0:31:30| to alleviate some of the money that they feel that are due them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1890)|
| 0:31:38| which was basically, I think, $525,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| I actually had a conversation with Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| That's his name, isn't it, Tim, this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| And I gave him a couple of different options that we may look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| And he's taking that to his board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| And we'll see what he comes back and says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| And so based on that's what I'll come back with on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| But either way, they're going to be funded, you know, maybe if it's this year, maybe $150,000 to $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1920)|
| 0:32:09| Let's just skip and take a little bit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| Depending on how we do this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Or there could be a different option where it could be a bigger one-time payment with nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| I mean, it helps their cash flow issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| And they went through the county IDB, I believe, for a better interest rate on their loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| So that helps them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| So he's taking that to his board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| And we'll see what they come back and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Mr. McKenzie-Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Well, I just appreciate the mayor's office for continuing this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| I know that this has been a, you know, we've all gotten a lot of touches on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| But I do appreciate you all, you know, continuing the dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| and hopefully to a resolution that suits both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| We think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| They, you know, the mayor is always engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| We know there's three organizations that are out there that have these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| as I like to call them, the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| And we're going to try to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| And we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| We'll see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| I think this is a good start for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| And there's one smaller amount that you'll probably see added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| With the three that we've got, we're going to try to come to some sort of compromise with all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| And, of course, I think it is admirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| that we honor at least the intent of the previous administration in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| And that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| On page 11, item number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2031)|
| 0:34:01| Incisoration of a resolution expressing the commission's support of the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| and requesting the Knox County clerk to send a true and correct copy of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| to Congressman John Deacon, Jr., Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Dr. Bridge, is that the one I heard you and the mayor talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| The one the mayor discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| One of the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| I'm just going to make a quick statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| And this is the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| You know, I've talked to a lot of people, not knowing what my position, just to get their ideas on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| And I think no one likes to pay a tax, particularly if this is a new tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| But there's a lot of sentiment that it's not completely fair to our local businessmen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| to the advantage of out-of-state businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| But I would like to put an amendment on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| And this isn't completely original on my part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| because this has been talked about already, you know, at the national and state level on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| is that we ask that this be a revenue neutral tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| In other words, if they're going to tax one thing, find a way of taking it back on another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| And what that does, that does level the playing field without putting an additional tax burden on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| you know, on the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| So we have an amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Is that acceptable to the maker of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Yeah, I just had a question on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| So if currently an outside entity is not paying tax, when you say it's revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| No, I want my amendment to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| Well, I guess what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Okay, so if your amendment is revenue neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| and today we've got abc.com that's selling a million dollars worth of goods in our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| and not collecting taxes, how do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| There's been, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| We would not have, we would not tax that for my end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| No, no, what they would do is that they would offset that by lowering the tax on people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| that are selling things in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Okay, so it's not limited to this entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| What it does is that, and this has been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Like I said, it's not an original thing, and I really don't know what the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| but there have been proposals to make this a revenue neutral tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| Yeah, I mean, I understand somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Is this that, it's the amendment that I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Yeah, the amendment is to make this a revenue neutral tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| You can take it from one spot, but you've got to give it back someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| So the net amount on the citizens is no increase in their tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| Okay, so if they're paying, again, I guess I'm probably going to only vote no for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| because I want to dig into this a little more, and if we pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| or I'll make a substitute motion that we send this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| You know, let me just make one comment on this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| You know, this is something that we really don't deal with, and I hate to spend a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| I mean, it's like, you know, passing a resolution on something that's going on in Egypt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| You know, we don't really have a lot of bearing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| I mean, we can make a statement, and that's what this is, but I think it's to send a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| You know, we're not going to have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| It has to be done at the national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| It has to be done at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| But I think that the message that I would like to send is that, ultimately, it's a revenue neutral tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| Yeah, and I definitely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| The reason I say that is because, you know, we've talked about it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Any of these sales tax put a disproportionate burden on our less affluent citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| And that's who we're protecting with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| Again, I just want to ensure that that amendment continues down that vein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| I support the resolution, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| just like you were saying when we had the folks from, I guess, Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| wanting us to do a ceremonial kind of push against the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| You know, I struggle with that myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| And I don't want to spend a lot of time on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| but I don't want to look down the line a couple of years from now saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| why did I vote for that when I didn't fully understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| So, again, I'd just like to pass it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| I don't know if I've got a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| So, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| The reason I'm seconding it is because I agree with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| Also, when we were in Washington at NACO, this whole thing came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| And there was a lot of discussion from the counties about exactly how this would impact the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| It's a state and it is a national, but it will impact counties because you're talking about sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| And so I think it would be prudent for us to maybe delve into it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| I know I'd like to call and have some more conversation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| So, if we're going to vote on it, then let's know what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| And so I'd like to have a little bit more discussion on it before we take a formal position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| But I agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| But I also know that there is an impact to counties on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| Ms. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Yeah, I was just going to say I've been working on this through NACO for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| This has been something that's come up that we've been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| And I think that you've got some good questions and I think it's fairly easy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| So I agree that no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| And I'm going to pass along some of the information I've got from NACO for you on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| that I think will hopefully clarify some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| This tax, when you buy something online, if you're not asked to pay sales tax through whatever it is you're buying it from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| you're still expected to keep track of that tax and pay it to the state at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2389)|
| 0:39:57| So it's not a new tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| That's tax that you're supposed to already be paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| I imagine a lot of people don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| So I think that's something that a lot of people don't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| But this isn't like passing something about something going on in Egypt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| This is going on nationally, but it's going to have a tremendous impact on businesses here locally in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| and in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Just one thing to keep in mind, that in a roundabout way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| this helps being revenue neutral to local people in that the tax they pay into a company online, Amazon.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2429)|
| 0:40:39| or whoever, first of all, that's going to come back to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| which in turn, with the revenue coming in there, allows us to have a lower tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| So it's going to affect in a positive way from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2448)|
| 0:40:58| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| The motion is for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| Item number 41 is a resolution expressing the Knox County Commission's opposition of any legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2470)|
| 0:41:18| that seeks to increase truck size or weight beyond the capacity of our road systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| and putting Tennessee highways, roads, and bridges at risk or increase damage or deterioration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| This is Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| This came from an organization to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| I forwarded the letter to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| And it was fairly widely agreed upon that sizes of trucks are to increase those sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| is a detrimental thing to our roadways and to our revenues in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| So, of course, that's the reason why we're putting it before you, just like a letter of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2513)|
| 0:42:01| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| On page 12, item number 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2531)|
| 0:42:21| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| approving a memorandum of understanding for the retirement of Richard Rawls, Resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| I didn't make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| I guess two questions I have is I would like to, because I came prepared to have a discussion about the previous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2577)|
| 0:43:08| about the internal order for position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| My question is twofold, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| As somebody on the Audit Committee, I'd like to hear the culmination of how we came to where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| Not that I'd agree or disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| I just want to make sure that we have had a due process as far as he knew where he stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| and Mr. Rawls knew where he stood, how he was thought of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| And also, I want to make sure that, and, Bud, this goes to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| is, you know, we had this severance discussion 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| Is this a legal, can't hold up in court kind of document that you've put together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| First question I suppose to someone on the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| Would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I'll respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| I hope the other members will also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| I would expect that you would hear the full presentation a week from today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| when Dr. Carsello was here who brought this to the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| and who has initiated this discussion, originally initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| It was venturing on the way of privatizing the audit function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| going out for bids among other firms, KPMG, Pew and Company, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| But there was a presentation of why Dr. Carsello felt that Mr. Rawls had not performed adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| and to the full extent that he deemed he should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| And a motion was made and it carried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| As you've all heard, I read about a four-to-one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| And I would, I'm not, you know, a professor of accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| I'd rather you hear that from Dr. Carsello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| But that's my synopsis of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| I'd like Amy and Dave can, of course, embellish it as they see fit if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| But that's, it was an unfortunate situation, but we voted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| and that's what came to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| And then I saw the agenda last week had changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| and I compliment Chairman Norman for his work in negotiating a better situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2713)|
| 0:45:21| Is Dr. Carsello going to be here Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| We were told he will be here Monday to present his full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| And I did just now forward, Dr. Carsello had emailed me the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| that he made at the July 9th Audit Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| And I just forwarded them to everybody on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| So you'll have that written document or should have it in front of you in just a few minutes as to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2741)|
| 0:45:50| And everyone was, like I said, it was a four to one vote to send this recommendation to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2750)|
| 0:46:01| At the time, when it came up last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| Commissioner Brown was not going to be here for that commission meeting and very much wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| And so we had agreed to postpone it a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| And at that time, I asked David Buch if he thought it would be possible to work with Richard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2775)|
| 0:46:23| to come to an agreement for a retirement, early retirement agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| so that he wouldn't have to end his career this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| And David thought that that was a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| And we asked Tony Norman as commission chair to take that up with Richard and work out an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| And I felt like that was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| I consulted with other Audit Committee members who were comfortable with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| So I feel like what we were able to do with this was much more respectful of Richard and his work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2817)|
| 0:47:06| And I do agree that Richard needed to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| So I think this is a much better way to do it than terminating him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| But I'm fully comfortable with our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| I'd like to make a substitute recommendation to go forward without recommendation until next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| because I'd like to hear what Dr. Carsello has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Before you go, Mr. Brown, we had one more member of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| I just wanted to offer Mr. Wright an opportunity to speak and then I've got a bunch of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| I really want to say, I need to say, the process that the Audit Committee was about has been probably two years in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2866)|
| 0:48:00| The Commission, full Commission, asked the Audit Committee to investigate the possibilities of internal auditing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2880)|
| 0:48:10| being done by county employee versus internal auditing being done by contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2890)|
| 0:48:22| And it's been a real learning curve for the members of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| because you might say we're too close to it, to realize what may be going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| But in the meantime, we've learned a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| And I believe that the reason we had a discussion earlier today about the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| and its relationship to full Commission, about a couple of audits that have been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| just an audit that was done within the last month and something we'd like to do over the next 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2932)|
| 0:49:00| to me illustrates the fact that the Audit Committee has, I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2940)|
| 0:49:10| the Audit Committee has very little or limited power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| The full Commission is in charge of the auditing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| And I don't want anyone to think that we members of the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| are doing anything trying to short circuit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| The main thing that was coming, was, I use the word was coming from the Audit Committee to full Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2966)|
| 0:49:35| was merely, that's too big a word one way, or demand, too big a word going the other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2975)|
| 0:49:47| but it was just, it was a recommendation from the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| about what we should think of internal auditing being done by an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| versus internal auditing being done by means of contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| That recommendation from the Audit Committee is no longer before full Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3007)|
| 0:50:16| It was before full Commission as a result of that recommendation going to the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| chair to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| And then I'm not, I do not know how this occurred, but I'm in agreement with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| The outcome being that something agreeable to both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| that's the county and the employee, be before full Commission to be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| and either approved or denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| That's what's before us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| So to say that Dr. Carcello, the chair of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| will be here Monday to speak to something that's not before Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| I somewhat am in the dark about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| So I don't know where we're headed to on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| But for the resolution that's sponsored by the chair of Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3072)|
| 0:51:21| as prepared by the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| we can discuss that any way that full Commission deem appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| because that's what the Audit Committee does for the full Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| We've got two separate issues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| and I do not think we should allow the discussion of what needs to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| from here forward to sully any more the reputation of Richard Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3110)|
| 0:51:58| You have a proposal before you today, a resolution that he has accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| Please let the man go out gracefully as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| Then we need to sit down and do some serious thinking about what needs to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| But please separate these two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Two quick questions probably of the law director that are more detailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| and then I have one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| And that's on Item 3 on the MOU with Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| With his insurance coverage, is that being paid at the rate that he's paying now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| for those 18 months, or is it covered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Do we cover that for the 18 months that we're going to extend the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| Is that the retirement rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| Is that the retirement rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| I guess I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| So I guess what I'm asking is, yeah, but with that, is there a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3182)|
| 0:53:13| I know that there's an insurance policy that covers full-time employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| and it's a different one that covers retirees, and the policies are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| The premiums are probably different as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| So I thought this was saying that the policy is going to the retirement work rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| is the premium – will he pay the premium for this 18 months is the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| The county will pay the premium for him for those 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Based upon his single coverage, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| But that's what this document is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| And then the second one is – and this is a – this is – whereas that's costing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| I do appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Item Number 5, I think, is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| I supported the mayor when he extended the pay to sick leave often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| If I make this calculation right, this $100 per day for sick leave is a reduced rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| So I appreciate both parties in that negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| So this – you know, while some things benefit some things, Mr. Wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| some things benefit the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| And I guess my statement is, you know, it's one of the things of working for the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3261)|
| 0:54:31| I mean, when we work for the public, our duties are called into question in a public manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3271)|
| 0:54:42| Our performance is called into question in a very public manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| And it just kind of comes with the nature of the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| You sign on to work in an entity as public as the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3290)|
| 0:54:57| It's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| So I know these are kind of difficult conversations to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| But, you know, we're paying for a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| That service didn't meet our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| I do think we need to discuss why it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| And maybe, you know, hopefully this will help the next person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| whether it's a private entity or another public employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| do a better job or not necessarily a better job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| but a job that really meets the needs of the county commission, audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| and the county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| So, you know, I don't – I'm fine to have this conversation with Dr. Cosello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| Mr. Wall, if he would like to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| I mean, I think things – you know, in this transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| I think things have to be vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| And if Mr. Wall wants to come and give his side of the opinion of the equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| I welcome that because we are a full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| and it is ultimately our decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| I mean, as Commissioner Wright said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| they're the audit committee's advisor in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| So, I mean, you know, that's what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| They've advised us in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| But it's our duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| It's our votes on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Mr. Ruanby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| I agree that these are two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Mr. Wall has agreed to this resignation and his buyout, severance, whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3381)|
| 0:56:30| And we should let him go in peace with his reputation intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3390)|
| 0:56:39| The other issue is that we have some questions that need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| Do we have a response for a comptroller that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| that there may have been some open meetings violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| that there might have been some sign-to-sign violations on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Not saying if there was or there wasn't, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| But we need to get answers either from Dr. Cosello or our law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| where these processes followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Was Mr. Wall's giving in five years of what I've heard no evaluations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3425)|
| 0:57:14| no telling him what he's doing right, what he's doing wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| Was he giving any notification on stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| These are answers that I think that we need to know of why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| because Mr. Wall has done a lot of good work for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| and probably not made a lot of good friends doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| But he's, as an internal auditor, is not there to make friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| He's there to tell us what we're doing wrong in our processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| and how we can correct them to make them right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| And I think we need to find out what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| What led up to this point that he wasn't doing a good job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| Was he notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Was he let know what he was doing right or wrong or anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| Because I've heard that he hasn't had an evaluation in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| And another question is, from my understanding, is the internal auditor answers to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| So if he's not doing enough work, did we not give him enough work to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| Did we not assign him enough audits to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| He can't just, from my understanding, go out willy-nilly and audit whoever he feels like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| He has to come to this committee and this commission and ask to do X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| And they have to approve what he's going to do year by year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| So, I mean, these are questions, why did we not give him enough work, if that's the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| So those are questions that I think need to be answered either by Dr. Cosello as the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| or this commission as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| And, of course, my involvement in the process has, I have lots of questions also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3535)|
| 0:59:05| But I agree with Mr. Brown in his point that this is something that needs to be separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3545)|
| 0:59:14| and dealt with at a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| And so I hope that we can go ahead and allow this agreement to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| and then deal with process and questions that pertain to what happened to Mr. Wall specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3562)|
| 0:59:31| to the process of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| And those things can be dealt with separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Yeah, I understand about how we can deal with these separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| But if, you know, if we're approving an agreement for him to go, I mean, I think one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| the commission has to decide, I think the things are linked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| Because if, you know, if this is sort of a four cause release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| that's a little difference in a severance package that you're making when a person retires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| or when a person does or is just being laid off because you no longer have need for their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3602)|
| 1:00:10| And I know, I don't know all the events that led up to this because we weren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| many of us weren't at some of the audit meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| Some of the meetings, I believe, were even closed meetings, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| which I agree that at times that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| And if this is not appropriate to ask these questions now and we want to defer it until next week, that's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| But I'll have to direct these to the members of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| Was this over a lack of work output or was it over a lack of work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| Okay, are you being rhetorical right now for next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| No, I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| I mean, what we're doing, let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| What I'm saying is that I don't know why we're releasing him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| I would like to say, Mr. Commissioner Norman, that I just forwarded Dr. Carsella's remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3659)|
| 1:01:07| And they're pretty to the point of why we did what we did at the July 9th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| And so I would ask everyone to read through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| And if you still have questions, bring them back to Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| Two things I do want to make perfectly clear, and I don't know where this is coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| but there were no closed meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Every meeting we've had has been an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| And there have been no violations of the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Everything has been publicly noticed and done according to the rules that we operate under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| So I do want to make those two things perfectly clear before next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| But I would ask that everyone just read over Dr. Carsella's statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| And any questions that you have, we'll go through them next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| We're still bouncing around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Do you have the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Yeah, I had just another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| This may help that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Were there some closed meetings at one point about something with the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| There never were any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Just that's out there and that's been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| So you can, Mr. Chairman, so that you can hear it from my mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| all of the Audit Committee meetings have occurred in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| I'm speaking for Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Have occurred in this room publicly and sufficiently noticed with the exception of one meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| that Dr. Carsella had sunshine that occurred at Panera's on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3758)|
| 1:02:47| That is the only, and that meeting was not one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| There were several people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| I would add there was another, I attended that meeting, Commissioner Wright's referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| There was another publicly noticed meeting on June the 30th at a restaurant in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| Commissioner Brawls, I think, Finance Director Caldwell and myself and Dr. Carsella was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| That was open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| But something else was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Never say never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| Four years, four and a half years ago, there was some type of a lawsuit threatened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| and then Director, Law Director Jarrett allowed Dr. Carsella to call a closed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3809)|
| 1:03:38| It was a closed via telephone meeting and we, that was probably Fenbar Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| That was before I was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| And myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| I don't know if Commissioner Wright recalls it, but it was a ten-minute telephone meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| about somebody was going to sue over something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| So there was a, in the history of the Audit Committee, in my four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| and nine months of being there, there was a technically closed meeting one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| In this situation, this topic, there's not been any closed meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| They've all been noticed and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| And I was just going to add something that Sam said there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| This 18 months is COBRA, which is the rate, the going rate, plus probably 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| But I just wanted to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| For people who do carry, since we're in a workshop, I'll throw this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| who do carry health insurance in their retired years through the county, it is the same rate if you're 64 or 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3865)|
| 1:04:34| So that is, we would know, it's a subsidized rate, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| I know this simply because we discuss it on the pension board sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| Something comes through the pension board occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| So common sense tells you the 64-year-old is not going to get what the 24-year-old gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| when he goes and buys health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| But the county, it would be the same rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| So Mr. Walls would get it or I would get it or whoever, you know, we're in our 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| If we carried that county retiree insurance, which we pay the county back if you retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| it's the same rate as the 24-year-olds, one rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| Okay, so there's a subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| But there's a subsidy, then there's an employee part, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| The subsidy is that if you went and it's the demographics are not fed into the system and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| this guy is 64, so he's probably going to have more wrong with him than he did at 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| So it's just an indirect subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| And it's in the abstract to determine how much that subsidy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| But there is a subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| I guess I want to make a statement to what Mr. Brown said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| I do agree now and see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| These are two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| And I won't ask Mr. Carcello anything Monday if Richard or if Mr. Walls has already agreed to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3942)|
| 1:05:49| I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| I think that discussion needs to come afterwards so we don't repeat this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| But I won't be asking any questions of Mr. Carcello in regard to Mr. Walls on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Two things, and I will respect my own request for not discussing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| but the information that Amy is sending all of us is one man's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| And just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Please do your own investigations of what is going on behind the scenes and all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| That's all I ask you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| And please separate this discussion by at least 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| Do not discuss this on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| We have before us no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| All in favor say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Ms. Broils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| In light of that, should we ask Dr. Carcello not to come on Monday and ask him to come the following month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4007)|
| 1:06:55| That would be my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| I mean, you basically got Mike's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| It's like you said, you got Dr. Carcello's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| So I want to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| So I'm going to ask questions if he shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| I ask you to do your own investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| You have information from former presidents of a 180,000 people unit audit association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4029)|
| 1:07:18| in conflict with what he has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| So I'm asking you just to do your own investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| That's all I want to say today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| We have no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4054)|
| 1:07:42| This resolution was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| It's a resolution approving amendment number three to a contract with the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| for the design and construction of turn lanes at the intersection of Ebenezer Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| and Northwestland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| which amendment provides for additional local matching funds in the amount of $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| for the construction phase of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| This is resolution 405.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| I'd like to add just a quick discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| I know this is highly unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| but they have sent out a notice about the James White Parkway extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| and I've asked Dwight Vandervate if he would check into that and report to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| on exactly what that release was this afternoon because I'd like to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| and I think our commissioners would like to know as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| They're going to have two public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| and then come through with a finished product and recommendation from TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| after those two public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| There was also, Dwight, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| It's okay if it comes down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Come on, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| They said something about a green alternative, that there was something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| I mean, again, that's why I asked you to check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| They have released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| They did it at 2.07, 1.07 central time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| so obviously 2.07 eastern time when the commission was already underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| but they've released in recognition of the community's concerns about the impact on the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| they have released a new alignment called the modified green route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| I've just glanced at the maps, but it appears on the southern end of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| it's a pretty significant realignment, appears to move the route pretty substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| And as Commissioner Andrews noted, they're going to have two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| They've released the route today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| They're going to have two meetings in October to give the public a chance to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| And it's up on TDOT's website now, and the map, a link to the map is up there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| So I think one important takeaway is that, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| nothing's going to happen on the project until after those meetings in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4198)|

| 1:10:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Are we at the end of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Not quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| Didn't put the roads on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Page 12, item number 46, is consideration of an ordinance amending Knox County Code, Chapter 10, Article 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4216)|
| 1:10:25| entitled International Property Maintenance Code to permit the temporary use of goats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| to control kudzu and other invasive plants on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| Ordinance number 0-12-9-101, adopted October 22, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| On first reading, this is Ordinance 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| This is a side note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| The city used those very successfully a couple of years ago in rounding some of our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| On page 13, item number 47,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| is an ordinance amending Article 5 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| Appendix A of the Knox County Code to remove district regulations for the sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| Ordinance number 0-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| As amended, this is on first reading, Ordinance 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| And, of course, this is just moving our zoning from our zoning ordinance to the beer ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Well, just a matter of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| Brad can correct me if I'm wrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| but this was done to kind of bring us our beer laws in line more with the liquor laws and, of course, distance and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4312)|
| 1:12:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| State law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| State law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| And we pulled it out of permits versus according to zoning versus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Item number 48 is consideration of acceptance of new county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4352)|

| 1:12:38| Item number 49 is line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4362)|

| 1:12:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| One thing about line items this month, I don't know if she can hold them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| but we have like 40 pages of line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| And this happens at the end of every fiscal year, so there's more than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| Because we cannot, our code will not allow us to end with a negative balance in any major category level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4385)|
| 1:13:14| You will probably hear me in the next several months ask you all to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| to try to change the level where we adopt our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| It's just cumbersome to do it at the major category level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| You'll probably, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| we could do something where we have personnel and non-personnel and keep the same category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| but adopt it at those levels, which would reduce on the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| would reduce the number of line items and really has no effect other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| Just food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| Question for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Chris, is this some of the same items, like the carryover items you mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| that you're going to get a list of us before Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| It's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| So?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Could you do, you know, if you, since it is such a long list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| if you got that list to us at the same time, then we, if we had a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| we wanted to do at a luncheon on Monday, we could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| I mean, so, like, here's an example of a line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| I'm going to use Hugh Holton purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| So let's say that he's overspent his contractual services by $200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| but he's got $500 left in supplies, which is like the 400 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| We've got to do a line item and get that approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| And it's all in his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| And so it's because we adopt our budget at the major category level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| and if we could adopt it at the org level or some variation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| To me, it's cleaner and we would not have as many issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4483)|
| 1:14:51| I know that Commissioner Hammond has signed a few of them in his days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| and Chairman Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| It just would cut down on those and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| any issues that we have with departments, we work those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| But a lot of these are just cleaning up issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| And so you've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| We, I think, they were added and then we just bring them for him to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| But I can get you a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| So you'll bring us recommendations about this process that you want to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4528)|

| 1:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Discussion regarding senior citizens home assistance service Renaissance Terrace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4539)|

| 1:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| We already did that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| So we're good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Discussion regarding the joint education committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| If you don't mind, Chairman Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| I'd like to discuss that next at the forum meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Item number 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Discussion regarding a mutual aid agreement for fire services with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| This is just from a call that a couple of calls that I have about from constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4571)|
| 1:16:19| about coverage of fire inside the city and outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| That, for some reason, premiums on fire insurance would be affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4585)|
| 1:16:34| would be affected greatly by some kind of mutual aid agreement between the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| and rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| Now, the law director and his staff have informed me we already have a mutual aid agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| in the form of state code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| And where we're getting a little confusion is that they're asking for a mutual agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| with the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| And the county doesn't have a fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| So any agreement that will impact what you call individual rates would have to be between rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4627)|
| 1:17:15| and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| And the county is really not a player in this because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| they don't have a fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| And how that really affects is if you have a fire station and or a fire hydrant within five miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| of your residence, that positively reduces a potential fire protection rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| So you may have a city fire hall closer than a rural metro fire hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| And if we have a mutual aid agreement, then they can use that distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| and it will reduce their rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| So that's kind of what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| There's really not much Knox County can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| It's more of a private company in the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| I just wanted to, because of the calls, bring it forward as discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| and so that publicly rural metro knew that it was being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| and if there was anything that needed to be done, they were given an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4691)|

| 1:20:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| I just had one issue to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I had a major oversight on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| I'm going to be going on a medical mission trip for a couple of weeks after the commission meeting on August the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| a week from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| I don't leave until later in the day on the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| And I won't be back until probably September the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| And I don't know if there's any way, this is really more to the law director, if there's any way to have me available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| to be able to vote when we have the special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| You know, if there's not, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| I don't know if there's any way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| Well, you have to be present to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| The special call meeting I'm referring to, I guess, is the reorganization meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| Under Section 2.06 of the charter, we can have a reorganization meeting on September the 1st or afterward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4866)|
| 1:21:16| if it doesn't give us a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| And that would be up to the chairman when to schedule that meeting would be your only, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| if they wanted to push it that far down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| It's pretty far down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| So, anyway, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Commissioner, as I said, I'm trying to meet him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| And for those of you that I've not had a chance to talk with yet on the reorganization meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| I guess we'll just go over here to the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| I've met with several people already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| And it's open to the press if they want to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| They've been to several of the meetings already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| So, those of you I've not had a chance to talk with, we'll just go to the small assembly room for a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| and want to get your feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| What is the date of this special call meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| I haven't said it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| But it will be probably what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Right after Labor Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Somewhere that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| I was just getting ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| You know, one other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| You know, one other thing, since I may not be here when we do this, because we usually make the committee assignments also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| If you recall, we've had a and we passed this reorganization of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| And so we will not need to appoint a commissioner to the ethics committee for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Just as a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| Ms. Sprouls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| I had coffee this morning with John Dickel, who is the head of Knox County Schools Nutrition Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4957)|
| 1:22:49| And he wants to come to the chairman's luncheon in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| And give us an overview and update of what's going on in school nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| And also wants to provide lunch for us from the school lunch program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4981)|
| 1:23:09| Pizza and corn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Only for those little milk boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| They're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| He's going to provide us with, you know, they manufacture their own pizza now, and it's a big hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| And so he's going to provide us with pizza and I don't know what else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| So lunch is covered for next month, and it will be what the kids are eating in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| And John will be here to update us on what's going on with school nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| I'm sure they'll give us their best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| I can advance notice so we can brown bag, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Commissioner, since we're talking about reorganization, let me go ahead with that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| It's been my honor to serve you as your chair this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| It's been fairly widely published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| I think that I'm not interested in and would not wish to be considered as chair in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5030)|
| 1:23:57| I think that the sooner we do this, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| And so I'd like to set this on September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| That's the Tuesday after Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| If there's no objections to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| What time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| I've got a luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| I've got a one o'clock meeting I need to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| It usually is a morning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Nine was, I think, what we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| So we'll let's just say nine o'clock, September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| And anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| Yeah, Jolie, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| The September chairman's luncheon is already reserved for this food bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| We have a reservation all the way through November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| So we may need to let the school system know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| We can do December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130819?start=5097)|
