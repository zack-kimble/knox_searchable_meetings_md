|  530    |  532    | And as someone who lives down the creek from there,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=530.0)   |
|  532    |  535    | because he's backfilled so much of that,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=532.0)   |
|  535    |  540    | it has severely impacted drainage and more flooding on my property                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=535.0)   |
|  540    |  543    | and my neighbor's property.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=540.0)   |
|  543    |  546    | And to my knowledge, he has not pulled any of the correct permits                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=543.0)   |
|  546    |  550    | or done any of the things that he is supposed to do to change the land the                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=546.0)   |
|  550    |  553    | way he has been.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=550.0)   |
|  553    |  556    | So I have a problem with the fact that he's just kind of doing whatever he                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=553.0)   |

|  563    |  566    | I just really have issue with that.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=563.0)   |
|  566    |  567    | And he owns the property.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=566.0)   |
|  567    |  571    | You can kind of see the driveway across the street kind of catty corner,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=567.0)   |
|  571    |  576    | which is also still listed as a single-family with a detached garage.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=571.0)   |
|  576    |  580    | And he's run that concrete business out of there for, what,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=576.0)   |

|  582    |  585    | And he parks heavy equipment and big trucks there all the time,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=582.0)   |
|  585    |  588    | which is the same thing he started doing at this property,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=585.0)   |
|  588    |  592    | which he said that they weren't going to park the trucks there.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=588.0)   |

|  594    |  598    | But there are large pieces of equipment and trucks sitting there all the time.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=594.0)   |
|  598    |  601    | So, I mean, he just says one thing and then does another.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=598.0)   |
|  601    |  605    | And I didn't think that's how we did things.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=601.0)   |

|  648    |  654    | And if he's going to run it as a business, I've got a small business right up the road there.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=648.0)   |
|  654    |  656    | And, of course, I've got a smaller lot.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=654.0)   |
|  656    |  662    | And one of the things that I had with the county was Holden Pond,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=656.0)   |
|  662    |  667    | which I eventually finally got away because my lot was just too small for the business,                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=662.0)   |

|  673    |  680    | large trucks that might have an oil spill or diesel spill or something like that, you need a Holden Pond.                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=673.0)   |
|  680    |  687    | The number two thing is if he's going to run a business out of there, you've got to have handicap accessible.                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=680.0)   |
|  687    |  690    | This house is not handicap accessible.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=687.0)   |
|  690    |  696    | So he's already running the business out of there and has been for now for several months.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=690.0)   |
|  697    |  705    | So, you know, it's kind of the type of thing is if you allow him to proceed, how much farther will he go?                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=697.0)   |
|  705    |  708    | You know, where does it stop?                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=705.0)   |
|  708    |  716    | I had heard rumors that he wanted to put a batch plant in there to mix his own concrete and stuff like that at one time.      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=708.0)   |
|  716    |  720    | So does it proceed into something like that, you know?                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=716.0)   |
|  720    |  727    | And that's what's got us more concerned on it because it's just not a good location for that particular thing, you know.      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=720.0)   |
|  727    |  729    | Thank you.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=727.0)   |
|  733    |  740    | It also, his property backs up to the creek, and you can kind of see in the very forefront of that photo                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=733.0)   |
|  740    |  744    | where he cleared some of the land out and piled up the brush right against the creek bank,                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=740.0)   |
|  744    |  747    | and I have a picture of it, and then there's another picture farther in there                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=744.0)   |
|  747    |  755    | where some of that washed down across other people's properties and has hit your fence right up against the edge of the road. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=747.0)   |
|  755    |  762    | And he's never cleared that up, never cleaned any of that up, you know, with the trucks and all that.                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=755.0)   |
|  762    |  767    | And he's got a large commercial gas tank, like, that you would fill a heavy truck with.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=762.0)   |
|  767    |  774    | Like, it's probably, what, 300, 400 gallons that's sitting right at the edge of that graded space,                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=767.0)   |
|  774    |  778    | which is in the floodplain, which is kind of concerning as well.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=774.0)   |

|  791    |  797    | Commissioner, since the applicant isn't here, we just discussed with our law director,                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=791.0)   |
|  797    |  800    | we can't really deliberate this at the moment.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=797.0)   |
|  800    |  802    | It's deferred.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=800.0)   |
|  802    |  803    | They are here.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=802.0)   |
|  803    |  807    | We're allowing them to voice their opinion, and you're more than welcome to come back next month as well,                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=803.0)   |
|  807    |  811    | but since you're here, we wanted to allow you the time to speak to us.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=807.0)   |
|  811    |  814    | Do you know why it was deferred?                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=811.0)   |
|  817    |  819    | It was at their request.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=817.0)   |
|  819    |  822    | There's a letter he sent.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=819.0)   |
|  822    |  826    | Basically, it says they're working to purchase a new property                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=822.0)   |
|  826    |  830    | that would be appropriately zoned for the repair of its vehicles.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=826.0)   |
|  830    |  838    | So, potentially, it's to maybe not be located at this location.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=830.0)   |
|  838    |  840    | And don't get me wrong.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=838.0)   |
|  840    |  843    | Like, I'm not anti-business, small business.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=840.0)   |
|  843    |  846    | Like, I want people to be able to make a living and do what they need to do.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=843.0)   |
|  846    |  853    | I just want them to go about it in the correct way, following the laws and regulations that we have in place.                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=846.0)   |
|  853    |  856    | You know, I would do that if I was trying to start a business.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=853.0)   |
|  856    |  860    | I would come and do the things that I needed to do in the right order.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=856.0)   |
|  860    |  861    | Yeah, I understand.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=860.0)   |
|  861    |  863    | Commissioner Daley?                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=861.0)   |
|  863    |  868    | That is the reason it was deferred to go to engineering, and engineering is checking,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=863.0)   |
|  868    |  872    | so you need to come back next month because a lot of the questions,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=868.0)   |
|  872    |  875    | it's what you brought up, already was brought up last month.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=872.0)   |
|  875    |  876    | That's why it was deferred.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=875.0)   |
|  876    |  877    | Okay.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=876.0)   |

|  883    |  887    | Just one question to Mr. Snowden.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=883.0)   |

|  893    |  903    | is that anything that could be taken action on until we do finish with this?                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=893.0)   |

|  907    |  912    | that we have him under a notice of violation for that of running a business.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=907.0)   |
|  912    |  916    | This particular location, I don't believe we have that.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-zoning?start=912.0)   |
