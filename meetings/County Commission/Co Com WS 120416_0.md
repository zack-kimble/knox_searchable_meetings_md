| 0:00:00| It is two o'clock, it is time for me to call into session the work session of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| It is April the 16th, and looking in our audience, we have a number of distinguished people here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5)|
| 0:00:10| I'd particularly like to recognize India Kincannon, who is a member of the Knox County Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=10)|
| 0:00:14| and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=14)|
| 0:00:16| Also, we have Mr. Craig Luthold, who is here, who is the chair of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| Craig, we appreciate your being in attendance, and we thank everyone for being in attendance here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=20)|
| 0:00:26| I would also like to make mention of the fact that Commissioner Ed Schaus was sent home from the hospital yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=26)|
| 0:00:31| He is now resting in his own bed, and so I hope that Ed is watching here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=31)|
| 0:00:36| I'm sure I would rather he be resting right now and sleeping rather than watching us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| but I'm sure he's probably watching to make sure that we do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=41)|
| 0:00:44| And, Ed, we appreciate any critique that you might have of our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| but we're just glad that you're home and that you're well, and we hope that you'll be able to be with us on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=47)|
| 0:00:51| But he can't vote from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| He can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| Maybe we could Skype, you know, and he could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=55)|
| 0:00:58| I'd like to recognize our law director, Joe Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| I'd like to recognize our new chief deputy law director, David Buch, who is sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=62)|
| 0:01:06| and David comes to us with 30 years of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=66)|
| 0:01:12| including having appeared before the Tennessee Supreme Court over half a dozen times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| and we're great to have him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Of course, he spent the entire morning with me, and he's having second doubts, but that's another story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| Also, you have your calendar for the month of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| It's going to be an aggressive calendar, as you might have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| We will have the mayor's budget message to us in this room May 1st at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| Then you have the remaining calendar issues there with regards to public forums, public hearings, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| And I know that you will be availing yourselves to all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| So let's get started with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| First, do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| If not, do I hear a motion that we go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Yes, I have a discussion item on commission, size of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=111)|
| 0:01:59| or actually more the size of the districts rather than the size of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=119)|
| 0:02:06| And I would like to postpone that until next month because I really feel like Ed needs to be here for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| In the month of May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| So we'll postpone that discussion until the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| If not, do I hear a motion that we add what needs to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| What needs to be deleted, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Next item is the approval of the minutes of the February and March meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| I'd like to have a proposed consent agenda, and the numbers are number 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=159)|
| 0:03:01| Commissioners, what I'd like to do is I'd like to take items 15 through 19 all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| We'll have to vote on them separately, but because it does involve quite a bit of money from the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| we'll address those all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| I will not put those on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| The next consent item would be number 22, number 23, number 27, and number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=195)|
| 0:03:29| Would any commissioner like to remove any of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| Are we going to have a pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| We do not have the pledge, but we can certainly do that on our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| Oh, we normally did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| It's not on my agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| I have to go by the sheet, and it's not on the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| But we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| I think it's very appropriate for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Item number 3, I do not wish to pull it from consent, but I do wish to be a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| As a matter of fact, would all commissioners like to be a sponsor of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| So we'll just make that from all commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| If not, do I hear a motion that we approve the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=248)|

| 0:07:44| I don't know, or both of you, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| While you're paying, what's the possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| We've got that little, almost like a one-lane bridge right there in front of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| before you get to school, across from the phone company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| What's the possibility of, while we're down there, working on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| widening that bridge right across from the phone company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| This is on this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| Near the elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Because all that just, and we're fixing to be up there at the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| you know, at Emory and Old Amherstville Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| What's the possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| The last time we had looked at that, Commissioner, it was somewhat cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| We can take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| It isn't something that we can just extend a pipe or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| It's actually a box culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Yeah, you told me that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| It's a box culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| It would be a little more involved, so we'll take another look at it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| But as part of this project, it isn't included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| but we'll definitely look at it and see if there's something we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| Traffic really backs up right through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Just one more, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| What is your formula for resurfacing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Is it based on some traffic count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| How do you determine that it's time for a resurfacing effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| We evaluate pretty much all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Well, we take, you know, citizen concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| and then we also ask all the highway department to give input to the roads that are in their district that are in disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| So we take all that and actually evaluate pretty much probably close to 50% of the roads annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| to establish which ones have the most cracking, which ones have the most deterioration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| and try to get, obviously, the ones that are in worse shape first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| So it's kind of a pretty involved process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| Motion on the floor is to, oh, Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Jim, correct me if I'm wrong, all these are state routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| and so that's why the state's 75-25 on all these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| No, these are all county roads, Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| It's just on the state aid system, which usually connects two state roads to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| or a state road to another classified main road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| But they are county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| It's just they're on the state aid system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| I want to recognize Superintendent of Schools, Dr. McIntyre, is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| And if you'll just hang with us a couple of minutes, we've got two more items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| and then we'll get the education consent to see if anyone has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| And, of course, Secretary Witt, our Register of Deeds, is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| So thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Our next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Item 18 is a resolution approving a professional engineering services proposal for CDM Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| in the amount of $194,000 for the preparation and final construction plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| for the widening of Parkside Drive from Mayberry Hood Road to Hayfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| This is Resolution 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Item 19 is a resolution approving a progression in the amount of $225,000 from local options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| sales tax revenue for the purpose of funding a portion of Knox County's total local match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| contribution for the three state aid contracts for the resurfacing of portions of Andersonville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| Park, Martinville Park, and Smith School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| This is Resolution 411.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Mr. Vandiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Mr. Chairman, if I could speak to that just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Really, the only thing I'd like to do is reflect on the record that Chris Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| in finance deserves tremendous credit for figuring out how to make the numbers work on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| state aid projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| We have not been able to take advantage of these for the past several years, and he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| the one who really put pencil to paper and finessed through the ability to get the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| And it has significantly increased the number of lane miles we're going to resurface from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| somewhere in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| We hoped at 20 to somewhere between 36 and 40 at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| So I did just want the body to know that Chris Caldwell deserves a lot of recognition for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| having made this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| We will buy him a cup of coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| Dwight, maybe we can put Chris on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| As you know, we did the employee incentive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| They came up with some ideas that would save Knox County some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| That might be our first contestant right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| You might want to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| I have a question about exactly where the money for the ‑‑ it says from local option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| So is this money is not coming out of money that we've already appropriated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| This is a new appropriation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| Where's Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Yeah, what we do is, as you know, the sales tax is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| So we're going to take advantage of some of the increase in engineering, the piece that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Because in order to take advantage of the state aid money, you've got to have that 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| It was like 453,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| So we're going to take 225,000 from an appropriation of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| And the additional piece will come straight out of their paving budget as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| And we'll do a line item transfer, which you'll get today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| We've got to move 453,000 from paving down to transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| And we'll move it to the public improvement fund where all those will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| We do that in public improvement to help with our maintenance of effort in the roads budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=792)|
| 0:13:21| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| I'd like to go back to education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| We have two items on education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Per our agreement with the school board, we have said that if there were any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| we would ask those questions at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Dr. McIntyre is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Does anyone have any questions about either items number seven or eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| My question may be for Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I don't know if it's for Hugh or the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| It's trying to understand the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| I know there's an item coming up in the next month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| Hugh, you'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Just trying to understand, are we consistent in our billing process for things like plumbing supplies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| I know there's a flooring contract that I'm going to have a few questions on that's coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| whenever it reaches that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| But I'm just trying to understand how we bid these items out for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Hugh, if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| It's Hugh Holt, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Every bidding process is the same from the county to the schools to any other entity that we bid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Now, you know, the contract I'm speaking of, it had the previous one had a couple of people that were eligible to keep up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| you know, on time delivery, to keep it competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| Some I see are single bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| So I'm just trying to understand how that happens and why we do it one way, one time and one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| That's at the prerogative of the end-using department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| whether they want to have a sole award or a single award versus a multiple award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| May I have a question for the superintendent on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| As to and I know I'm a little early, but I guess it does kind of concern me, not this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=907)|
| 0:15:18| but the, you know, it's a pretty good comparison as to the flooring contract that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| I don't know if it's been let or not, but it's been altered pretty drastically, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=925)|
| 0:15:33| I was doing some inquiries on why it wasn't proportional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| The previous contract wasn't very proportionally distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| They kind of used one contractor 90 percent of the time and the other one 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| And then the new bid comes out and we just kind of got rid of the 10 percent contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| So, again, I'm just trying to, as early as I can, understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| And I don't want to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| If you want to get back with me maybe on that, that will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| But it's, you know, I know folks in the mayor's staff was questioning that process prior to the bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| and now the bid comes back and they're magically deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| And I'm just really concerned with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| So it's more of a general question about how we make the decisions to sole source some and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| not do others but then change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| And, Mr. Chairman, Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Commissioner, I do not have an answer for you in terms of specifics today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| but we can certainly look into that and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Obviously, we work closely with Mr. Holt and the purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| whenever we put out bids for contracted services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| And I will certainly take a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| and see what the rationale might have been for the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| You and also for the superintendent, both of you, I was glad to see this go to Kenny Pop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| who's a small business owner, a fine individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| I was glad to see that a small business individual got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1019)|

| 0:18:08| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Well, is it yours, Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| It's going to be assisted living, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| It's a team effort, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| What else is the game plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| I'm going to grant Rosenberg, Knox County Community Development, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| And Mayor Burchett, I think, is on his way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| He wanted to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| But we can turn things over to the developer, to the winning proposer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| But, yeah, to answer your question very briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| it's proposed for 58 units of assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| It's actually one of the end uses that was identified years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| when there were a series of public meetings on behalf of this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| something that the neighborhood actually wanted to see take place at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| So a very good proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Our staff has reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| We've been working very closely with the development team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| We've moved very quickly on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| and we feel it's going to be a good project moving forward for both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| But I'm going to turn things over to Rick Dover and Wayne Blasius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| Gentlemen, if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| And if you could kind of give us your --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| It's pretty impressive when you look at the investment that you're putting into this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| and what you're going to do with it in terms of payroll, economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| If you could share those numbers, I think that would be extremely helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| I thought the mayor was going to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| Wayne Blasius, 8410 Thornberry Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| I thought the mayor was going to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Yeah, I think he's behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Rick Dover and I are excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| The Oakwood School, as you may know, has been in its past a great asset for the Oakwood community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| and over the last 12 years it's become a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| There have been proposals in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| It's a difficult building because there are a lot of issues and problems with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| but we are convinced that we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Our companies are, I think, uniquely qualified, and we can go into any level of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| But I know you've got a long agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| We can't do it, though, without a little bit of assistance to try to get it back to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| It's got a lot of structural problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| It's got hazardous wastes, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| from having been open to the elements for a good bit of its time since the school closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| And so we are asking for assistance through the Industrial Development Board to get back to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| and then we will go forward as a private sector project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| Rick, I think, handed out a sheet that has the economic benefits that we've calculated for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| which approach $2.5 million a year, including payroll for 35 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| which we hope will be largely from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| It's a great use that the neighborhood is very positive about in terms of all the feedback we've received so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| It's kind of a low-impact use that is a great neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| And interestingly, people, I think many of you know Dr. Paul Kelly that used to be on school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| Paul's wife was telling me that at some point he may have to go someplace, and she's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| I wish you could be in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| So we're happy to go into any level of detail you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| And I – Mayor Burchett, do you want to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| He usually calls me Tim, but I'll answer to Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Tim Burchett, 6401 Airtree, Mayor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| This is – you hear about good deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| This is a good deal, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| It's going to be cheaper for us to go this route and save this whole building than it would to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| You've got pigeon droppings, which cause, I think it's histoplasmosis, which I'm sure Dr. Briggs can explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| It's an ailment of the lungs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| I can remember when I was down in Nashville and had some problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| One of the legislators actually had to have part of his lung removed because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| And, of course, the lead and asbestos and our – I think some of our less than scrupulous constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1325)|
| 0:22:14| have eradicated our copper from the building, which wasn't a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| But this is going to be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| This school, a little bit of facts that we should know about, the development of 58 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| It will be 58 units of assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| It's a private investment of over $4.5 million in the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| And here's one of the best things about it is the creation of 35 permanent jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| It will provide an estimated payroll of $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| and estimated city and county property taxes of over $77,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| And I spoke extensively with Mayor O'Hara about this, and she is in agreement that this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| It's a good thing for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| It's a good – you know, I'm a small government kind of guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| but this is a situation where we just go a little slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| We're going to get there a little faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| And that's what we did in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| I remember – and I know Commissioner Broyles, she braved that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| It was a torrential downpour of biblical proportions almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| We were gathering up the animals by two, I think, out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| And Commissioner Broyles was kind enough to come out there on that day, and we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| folks – and people in the neighborhood and the historic preservation groups were all saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| You know, he gave it a good shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| It's time for the wrecking ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| And I said, no, I want to give it one more shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Hugh and Grant, of course, deserve all the credit from our end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| They really – they understood that I was interested in it, and they went and left no stone unturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| And these fine folks here are local, which I'm proud to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| And this is going to be a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| This is something we can all be proud to put our names on at the end of the day and cut the ribbon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| It's going to be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| It's good for the community, and it will be good for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| So I'd appreciate your all's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| If you have any technical questions, my guys, of course, can answer it, and theirs can too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| So if anybody has any questions of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| I really don't have a question to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| but I sat at the presentation at the Development Corporation Board when the mayor was there, and we saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| And just to be sure I understand this, and this is a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| I mean, this is the kind of thing after we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| and what we've gone through with the old high school in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| it would have been really nice if we could have come up with something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| But what they'll do is they will take some funds from the development corporation or the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| and we have to put a roof on it, fix things up a little bit to get it into shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| so then you can go and get your construction loans from someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| And basically what we're doing is that the incentive for this that we're doing financially is to get the roof put back on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| and get the building in enough shape so somebody will loan him the money, loan you the money to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| And I believe that's really what we're voting on here today too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| As I stated, it's going to be cheaper for us to go this route than it would be to tear it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| because you really don't know what you're going to get into on the environmental front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| when you start tearing down one of these old buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| And we're preserving a great building, and we're making the neighborhood better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| I mean, it's like a quadruple win on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| And having heard the more detailed presentation at the Development Corporation Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| I support this thing fully, and I think we all should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| Thanks, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| I think this is a wonderful project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| and I think this type of public-private partnership is really, you know, what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| It's one of the better things that we do here on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| I also had a lot of opportunity to work with Wayne on both at my day job there in Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| and my former life with the city's Industrial Development Board, and he does tremendous work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| So I'm comfortable with the team that's put together as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| A couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| This is just probably more for Wayne or someone from his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| When you're done or you may not, I know you're at the conceptual stage, but when you're done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| are we talking about a cafeteria type set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| Help me understand assisted living exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Let me let Rick explain those because his company does assisted living and we're teaming up on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| but he's the expert on that, so let me let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| Hi, Rick Dover, 2018 Cherokee Boulevard in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Yes, we'll have full meal service for all our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| We staff the building 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| There's aides there as well as nurses 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| So our residents each have an individual apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| but we will have three different dining rooms and one full commercial restaurant kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| I mean, we'll serve right at 200 meals a day there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| In terms of I'm looking at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Are you all using the property for kind of, you know, exercise, keeping the muscle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| Are you all engaging in that aspect of the active senior's life as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| We'll have a full-time activities director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| We'll have a full wellness facility on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| and we'll have a physical therapy group that will come and have a studio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| or facility for their practice within our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| And we'll keep our residents healthy and active as well as seeing patients from outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| I just think, you know, I think more and more, you know, as the guy who alluded to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| Oh, I guess it was Wayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| You know, folks like Paul Kelly or my dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| keeping them closer into the neighborhood that they have to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| and make a life and raise a family, and I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| So those are my only questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Wayne, I think it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| I'm for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Commissioner Broyles, I want to thank you for letting us, you know, hold off for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Hugh, what was going to be the cost to tear this down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| What was our cost going to be that was coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| What was the low bid on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| The initial estimate for demolition was $350,000 plus or minus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| plus any other landfill costs that we would incur following the demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| So it's quite expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| What do you estimate its value as it sits now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| Well, the appraisal is $12,000, and that's a 54,000 square foot building on half a city block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1714)|
| 0:28:45| I just want to reiterate, you know, one more time just to the administration, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| the mayor, you know, we've got to see what we've got out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| We've got to see what our inventory is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| And if we've got buildings, we cannot afford to let our buildings get in this shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| I don't care if they're schools or just whatever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| We cannot, because we as taxpayers, we're losing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| You know, $12,000 for a $54,000 thing, that's, you know, if we kept up with it a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| we could have got a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| It's a great deal for these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| They're coming out great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Commissioner Smith, of course, you realize when we got the building, what was it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| How long after we got it did the roof cave in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Oh, it was just a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Just a few months after we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| And we were already in the process of trying to get an RFP the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| And that's when we got the building, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| I mean, this is our, Tim, this is before your time, before you even arrived on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| But this is our third school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| We've gone through this, and we're giving our schools away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| You know, I'm glad to get them back on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| but we just need to be more awake at the wheel as to what properties that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| Are we going to sell them, get rid of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| What are we going to do if, you know, we own these buildings as taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| but we owe it to the taxpayers to get the most that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Like I say, I'm for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| You know, is your wife going to put a park up there, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| I know she'll want to put a park up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| But it's going to be a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| How long do you hope to cut the ribbon on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| When will you be finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Maybe three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| But, Mayor, I'm looking at the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| You know, Hugh, we've got the same thing happening over at Rural High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| About 18 months, they think, after they start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| But they've got to start first, so 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| We've got these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| We've got to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| If we're going to keep them, we've got to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| I just forwarded to you the e-mail to send to these guys about the next neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1842)|
| 0:30:52| That's got the contact information of who to contact and where it is and what their agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| So if you all can make that, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| If not, there will be another one next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| But Oakwood School is something that those of us who live in this area have been working for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| to try to make something fabulous happen with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| And we are so happy about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| We're just absolutely thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| This is the best possible scenario for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| We were talking about ideas about what we'd like to see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| Assisted living for seniors was the first thing mentioned, and it was the thing that was mentioned the most often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| So we are absolutely delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| And I know from researching your company what good neighbors you're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| and what a great, great facility this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| And Jamie and I have already decided that when we can no longer care for our house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| we're going to move across the street, across Woodland, and into your assisted living facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| So that's where we're going to be living out our golden years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| We're taking deposits right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Commissioner, I like what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| You said this is a good deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| If it goes south, it'll be on Tim Burchett's shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| But if it does right, the whole commission can take all pride in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| because this is an initiative put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Well, I mostly want to single out Grant Rosenberg for all of his hard work on keeping the focus on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1930)|
| 0:32:18| and making it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| We are so lucky to have him in this area, and we're lucky to have him on Knox County staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| So I'm thrilled with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=1945)|

| 0:35:18| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| I have several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| I'm sure there will be others, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| So we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Who is going to be discussing the University Commons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| I'll talk a little bit about generalities, and I think the folks are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| You know, one of the problems when I spent my tenure in the legislature that we dealt with was brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2144)|
| 0:35:54| It's a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| We're sort of in that hazy ground, and people generally are afraid of brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| But the reality, two of the biggest outside investments in the state of Tennessee are done on brownfield sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2161)|
| 0:36:09| One of those happens to be Volkswagen in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| A brownfield site is an industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| It's usually light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| It could have some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| And generally what happens is people are afraid until they get some sort of okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| or some working arrangement with the government, and that's what we're going to have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| This thing, what they'll do is they'll actually almost encapsulate the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| so you won't have the long-term effects that you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| It's an old industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| I think it was the Bellows that was the thermostat in your automobiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| and they created one for the Second World War and airplanes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| But anyway, the industrial regulations now are a whole lot stricter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| and you don't see these kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| But we're sort of saddled with these properties all over, and we're looking for jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| and there are some specific areas that they can locate in these brownfield sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| that will be productive for our community, and this is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| It's an old site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Everybody knows about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| We've driven by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| I can remember it was a factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| I can remember Congressman Duncan asked me to go out and work the line there when they were coming in to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| but I found out it probably wasn't a good place at 4.30 in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| seeing a bunch of hardworking men and women coming in, shaking their hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| and asking to vote for somebody at 3 o'clock in the morning probably wasn't one of the better ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| But I'm sure all of you all maybe have fonder memories of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| But anyway, this will be good for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| I think it's going to generate an incredible amount of tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| It's another one of those city-county projects where Mayor O'Hara and I are working together on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| and we would hope for a favorable situation from this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| And at that point, I'll stop and turn it over to my folks if they'd like to speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| My name is Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Very briefly, I think the mayor kind of gave the overall of what the property used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| and I think, for that matter, most people on the commission are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| And this project has been in the media for the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| But just to briefly recap, we – our desire is to develop an infill brownfield site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2311)|
| 0:38:41| and to put two large retailers and some other shops there because of the facts of the site from the environmental standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2321)|
| 0:38:50| from the regulations imposed by TDEC, and from some traffic issues that we will have to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2330)|
| 0:39:01| And with the parking structure that is a component of having to develop this site, we're asking for tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2341)|
| 0:39:10| And, in essence, we have a lease signed with Publix Grocery Stores for approximately 50,000 square feet of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2350)|
| 0:39:20| We have a lease signed with Wal-Mart Stores for approximately 120,000 square feet of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| The Wal-Mart will be what they consider their – they call their division one store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| which harkens back to really to many years before they started the super center process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| They liked this project enough that they were agreeable to doing only a general merchandise store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| They were agreeable to working with Publix from the standpoint of what they can and can't sell from a food product standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2386)|
| 0:39:55| They were agreeable to significant not only upgrades in the architectural look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| but to go on the second level and allow the structured parking to be beneath the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| They were agreeable to allowing a reduced from normal parking ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| They also were agreeable to allow us to put some of the shops not only on the first floor that would be in front of the parking structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2414)|
| 0:40:23| but on the second floor in front of part of their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| So, essentially, and I think you will probably see some of these pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| our intent for this development is for it to resemble more of an urban design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2431)|
| 0:40:38| For that matter, we think it is – it's an urban location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| As you will see, we are proposing to come in from Kingston Pike and to build a bridge connecting to the bridge that's currently the Joe Johnson Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2442)|
| 0:40:55| This has been studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| We have had CDM Smith, which was Wilbur Smith, has done an exhaustive traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| They took into effect not only what our project would add, but they took into effect the city's planned road diet on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2466)|
| 0:41:17| They have come back with recommendations to briefly summarize those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| The Kingston Pike area where you have several constituencies vying for one intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| you have the Metron Way, which is now a UT facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| You have the Tyson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| You have the at-grade rail crossing, which is the Gulf and Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| And then you would have – you did have the Fulton Bellows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| which would become essentially one of the entrances into our proposed retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| The plan is – and this has been studied and designed by CDM Smith –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2511)|
| 0:41:59| is to essentially redo that whole intersection from the standpoint of the signalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| tie in and redo the lights starting clear back at Nalin and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| coming all the way down to past hours and synchronize those lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| And then the plan is when the city comes in and does the road diet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| those lights would be synchronized even all the way to 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| The other issue that we found in the traffic study that currently exists is an issue at Nalin Drive and Joe Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2547)|
| 0:42:37| And it exists really in the peak morning and the peak afternoon when the university –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| when professors and students are coming in and coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| But the plan there – they have come up with a plan for us to do re-striping on Nalin Drive, re-striping on Joe Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2566)|
| 0:42:57| redoing how that signal operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| And even when you add our proposed traffic post-development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| it actually creates a better intersection than currently exists right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| And basically we feel that the same will hold true for the intersection at Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| We can make that full traffic impact study available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| We certainly have the engineers that will be here next Monday if anyone needs to ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| I've studied it quite a bit. I can answer some of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| The issue with the environmental impact is that, as the mayor said, it was the Fulton Bellows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2614)|
| 0:43:42| It did have contamination. It was groundwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| The TDEC requirements are that there be minimal invasion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| Essentially all we're allowed to do is drill holes for the caissons and the piers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| and then to elevate everything else above that, in essence encapsulating the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2637)|
| 0:44:06| And not only that, but a large portion of that has to be elevated so that there would be a vapor barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| so that if there were ever any concerns of vapors coming from the property, that that would be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| It's one of the reasons why the current owners and TDEC really preferred to have commercial or retail development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| as opposed to residential development is because of some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| I point out these things because these are questions that have come up repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| I realize on the surface that may not necessarily have anything to do with why are we asking for the TIF financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| In essence, the project is costing about $25 million more to do this entire project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2682)|
| 0:44:50| than it would cost if you went out and just did it in what we refer to as a greenfield location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| I do want to point out that as a part of this TIF, Walmart and Publix will be paying their fair share of taxes each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2696)|
| 0:45:05| starting from year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| They're not they themselves are not getting any kind of a discount in their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| It gets reassessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| They pay their taxes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| We pass these real estate taxes and insurance on to all of the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| That tax will go into the reserve fund to pay off the TIF loan that we take out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| So I just wanted to clear up that we're not asking taxpayers to give money to us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| We simply are taking a site that is currently generating $6,800 in county property tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| When you add day one from when we opened our project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| when you add the amount that we have to additionally contribute by way of the county's debt service requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| from day one the county tax will go from about $6,800 to approximately $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| That's actually even during the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| So the taxes do go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| We are probably about 600 estimated construction jobs, about 1,100 permanent jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2762)|
| 0:46:11| Our payroll impact has been estimated at $51 million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| with a total economic impact for the overall project of about $226 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2775)|
| 0:46:27| Sales tax, obviously neither one of these stores are a relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| I'm not about to stand here and try to say that all sales taxes will be net new sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| But we certainly feel like that there will be a certain amount of net sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| One of the things that people may not realize, and this is a federal term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| but this property is in what's known as a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| And there are, for instance, Alcoa Highway lost their grocery store that was on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| From this site on Alcoa Highway, the nearest grocery store would be all the way into Alcoa proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| Going Kingston Pike, it would be all the way to the Kroger Earth Fair out in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| Then you would have the food city just to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| And, you know, going east, it's very hard to get grocery store, for that matter, any kind of retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2842)|
| 0:47:31| A geographic study also estimated and pointed out that there are a certain number of trips on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| that are leaving the university simply to go to shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| And they're estimating probably about a 10 to 15 percent reduction in that because of being able to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| ride bikes, or be on either a cat or the university's trolley system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| As Arthur pointed out, all of the tenants will be having the other general business license taxes, sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2876)|
| 0:48:05| And as I pointed out, even during the period of the TIF, it's not as if the property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| and the revenue coming into the county is going to go up by about six or eightfold and then go up drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2891)|
| 0:48:20| These numbers are a part of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| So, anyway, as a lot of people on this commission that are familiar with me know that I have developed retail projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| and historically have developed them in the outlying areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| And one of the themes over the last eight to ten years that I have had hammered on me time and time again is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| why do you have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| Why can't you come in and do something infill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Why can't you find a brownfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| And if you have to, put structured parking on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| And then, in that case, that makes for a perfect public-private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| And that's what we think this project does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| So we're asking for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| I definitely agree on your last point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| I would like to see the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| If it's greater than 100 pages, is there any way you can get me a digest of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| It actually is less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| But we can get something that's a little more than the bullet points that you have in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| but not there's a lot of tables and stuff that we can kind of synthesize it maybe into a couple of pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| And you talk about the Cumberland Avenue diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| What is the diet plan for that section of Cumberland Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| Is it one lane with a couple of turning lanes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| What's the plan, the ultimate plan for Cumberland in that general area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2989)|
| 0:49:57| Starting at 21st or 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| 22nd Street going east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| The plan is to reduce that from currently as four lanes to in either direction to three lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3003)|
| 0:50:11| which would be two in either direction with a continuous turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| And that's through 17th Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| That's through 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| So help me, orient me on that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| So you're talking about from 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| I'm going to go west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| You're starting at 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| And it ends where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| At 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| At Jason's Deli, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| Jason's Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| So your part shouldn't, won't change much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Our part won't change much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| But when we first asked the engineers to start working on this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| they came to us and they said, look, you know, the city is planning to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| And, you know, we don't know whether it's going to help us, hurt us, or be indifferent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| But it's going to be, you know, if our project, if everything goes well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| our scheduled grand opening would be in July of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| And the city would be starting either right about that time, if not before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| So we know it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| So we said it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| Good planning is that you go ahead and take it into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| and let the chips fall where they fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| So that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Are you concerned about the Tyson Park turn lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| I mean, that's a pretty active park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| Are you comfortable with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Obviously, that was our first concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| When we entered the project, we knew that there were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| that it was an environmentally challenged site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| But the current owners and their engineers had done extensive studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| and had worked extensively with TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| So we felt like that that was probably already headed in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| But we were very concerned initially about the Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| Frankly, we didn't realize the situations at Nalin and Joe Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| until the traffic study came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| And then we've had extensive meetings with the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| They were very concerned about that area, especially the agricultural dean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| because that goes right through the ag campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| And, again, we've had, we've probably had four or five meetings with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| and had come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| And what they want us to do and we've agreed to do is prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| or build what in the industry are called speed tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| And they have two or three existing pedestrian crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| And one of their concerns is that currently traffic comes over that bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| coming from Volunteer heading towards Nalin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| And they wanted to figure out how to slow that traffic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| So the first thing that we're doing is we're putting a traffic signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| at what would be our entrance that would be at the top of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| That will have the effect of slowing that traffic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Then UT asked if we could construct this speed table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| not only at the next signalized intersection down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| and I forget the name of that road, but you know where I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| And then two additional crosswalks that do not have signals there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| But these speed tables are essentially where we actually build it up a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| about six inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| It's not like going over a speed bump, but it's where the pedestrians walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| You can see it visually, and it does rise, so it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| It forces you to slow down, and it forces you to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| whether even if there's not a pedestrian currently in the walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| that that's something that they need to slow for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| And we feel like we have allayed all of the university's concerns in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| And Commissioner McKenzie, we have already these studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| and these plans have been going back and forth through the city engineering office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| and the State Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| And they have gotten to the point where they have signed off on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| that they feel comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| Yeah, because there's a – I'm just letting commissioners know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| I'm ignoring the timer there, so you guys can pay attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| But I'm going to choose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| There's a drop in elevation from Volunteer down to Neyland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| So Neyland looks like there is, as you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| So I guess with that pedestrian, this is just a general question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| are we concerned with blind spots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| Does the plan address that in terms of the pedestrian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| It addresses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| It looks at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| There's not really blind spots from a pedestrian standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| One of the reasons why they wanted us to put a signal at our entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| is just because there is an arc to that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| And by having it signalized and then timing that signal with the current signal at Volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| and Joe Johnson would make that safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| From a pedestrian standpoint, there's already a sidewalk we're going to add –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| I think we're going to add – I think the city wants us to add another sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| actually on Joe Johnson because there's room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Then we're also creating a dedicated bike lane in either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| And then the bridge that we build will have sidewalks on either side with dedicated bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| What material is the primary contaminant there at Fulton Bottoms or whatever you call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3312)|
| 0:55:20| There were three or four, and I would try to say the name of them, but I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| Is it chemical or metal or beryllium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| It was chemical stemming from the solvents that they used in their manufacturing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| How many-year TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| This one's 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| We are asking for a 25-year TIF, and part of the reason is that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| it's about a two-year process for the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| And then essentially just in order for us to feel – we think that with the taxes going up over those years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3351)|
| 0:55:59| that it would probably be retired in 20 or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| But to be safe, we think that a 25-year amortization for what we need is the amount we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3362)|
| 0:56:10| And I feel like that the KCDC folks have been comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| We've discussed it with the city side, and they understand that it's a little bit out of the normal for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| But we also feel like that this – again, I've been here before talking TIFs with you people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| but I think if there was ever a poster child for a TIF, it's this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| and the one you just heard a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| Keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| You're not violently agreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| So 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| The parking, how many parking spots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| 812, 815.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| It's fluctuating a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| And the reason that fluctuation is that between the Gulf and Ohio Railroad and then the elevated CSX Railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3413)|
| 0:57:02| the Gulf and Ohio is owned by the Claussen family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| And we have worked out to have some parking between those two railroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| and have agreed to construct a train depot, which I think there's a depiction of that in your package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| And the Claussen's desire is that that will become the new home of the Three River Rambler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| which is their excursion train they operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| And so we're still tweaking exactly the design of that depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| and that's why that parking ratio continues to fluctuate, but essentially about 815.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| The ratio to underground parking to street-level parking is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3458)|
| 0:57:45| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| 90-10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| It's probably, if not more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| It's essentially the street that would be connecting Kingston Pike and Joe Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| Our thought is that that would become our main street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| and it has parallel parking on the side just like Gay Street does in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| and that would be our main street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| And with the elevated nature of the buildings, it would look more like a downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| And with the Gulf and Ohio Railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| you've probably been to many towns where you see the old-fashioned train depot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| and you have the main line running right down Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| And that's kind of our thoughts as to how this project would look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| Well, Commissioner McKenzie, you've asked most of my questions, so you've had my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Mr. Coleman, real quick, what exactly is the, you know, we went over the North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| and we talked about how I feel about TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| What exactly is the TIF paying for on the drawings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| The TIF would be paying for the encapsulation method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| and for part of the cost of having to do the elevated parking structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| It would be paying for the bridge that would ramp up to Joe Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| It would pay for the redo of all of the intersection both at Nalin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| and Joe Johnson and Kingston Pike and our entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| Jim, help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| That's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| So it's nothing to do with the building other than the parking structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| Nothing to do with buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| It's really environmental and upgrades on both ends of the product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| That's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Brad, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you for the same question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| But the $10 million is going to be for the upgrades on the parking garage and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| Did you not do your market survey before you did this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| What if you didn't get this $10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Oh, I mean, yeah, we've done the market survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| I mean, we have got this project to the point where for it to go forward we need this TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| Yeah, I mean, for that matter, you've probably read we're also that in and of itself is not going to win the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3592)|
| 1:00:00| We're working to acquire what are known as new market tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| and that's something I don't know if anyone is familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| but it's through the Federal Treasury Department, and they put allocations out on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| and our project qualifies on just about every front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| So we're working through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| But to answer your question, Commissioner, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| unfortunately in our business we have to spend a certain amount of time and money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| as we have on this one, to get it to the point that we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| You know, I certainly don't think this is something that the commission has to think about, but it would be impossible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| I would think, for this commission to make a decision if I wasn't able to stand here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| yes, we have done this traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| Yes, we have done these architectural studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Yes, we have done this environmental engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| Yes, we have actual tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| It's not speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| It's not something we're going to buy and you're going to give a $10 million TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| and five years from now we're still going to be out there with nothing developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| We know that if we get this TIF and we get these new market tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| we have already gone through the rest of the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| You know, and some people can say what they want about, you know, Publix or, for that matter, especially Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| But the one thing about this project is it's not speculative in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| We have two qualified tenants that when we do this project we know then that it will be stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| and it will be stable for the next 25 plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| And you have great tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| I like the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| I like what we're doing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| I think it's a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| You've got all the University of Tennessee students over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| You're really going to have a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| But I'm just going to have a hard time on this $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| And you're talking about you're not ñI don't see any new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| Like you said, the students that are over there now and the homeowners that are close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| they're going down to the Bearden area, they're going to Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| So I don't see that we're generating anything new there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| But I just ñI'm having a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| And here's why I'm having the most hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Because you still haven't finished your job out at Hoss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| We're still waiting for you to come out at Hoss where you had the TIF out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| We've been working on this for years and years to finish the moving utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| And you all haven't finished that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| And we're going round and round on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| And you promised that to the people years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| And I have a hard time giving you a TIF when you haven't finished with what you said you were going to do out in the Hoss community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| With all due respect, Commissioner, let me point out I didn't get a TIF in Hoss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| And the second thing is I started the work at Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| You're referring to the intersection of Emory Road and Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| And I started the work on that and was asked by the county to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| because one of the landowners didn't like the way that the county had approved the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| And I have been very, very patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| I have ñto this day, I have traffic signals and electrical boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| and everything that have been sitting in a warehouse for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| And I have been carrying on a dialogue with the mayor's office and with Mr. Vanderveet's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| And we have a plan on how to solve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| But I do want to defend myself that I have not shirked any responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| There was no TIF involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| That was all our funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| And we had it funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| And we were ñwe had our crews out there and started construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| And the county stopped us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Dwight, can you update us on that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Because I know we were fixing to call in the bond on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| It just seems it's taking for a long time, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Well, it has, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| But, actually, I would essentially just echo what Mr. Cullum has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| We've continued to have some ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| We actually were e-mailing back and forth today about an inventory of the equipment that he has for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3825)|
| 1:03:54| And we reached some agreement as to terms as to how the county might move forward on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| At this point, it would be easier for us to simply complete it ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| if Mr. Cullum would provide us with equipment and funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| And that's going to require an agreement that's going to come before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| But he has been at the table with us generally throughout this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| I think we have an agreement in principle as to how we're going to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| And it is my hope to have an agreement before you in the month of May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| because I'd like to start construction on it as soon as school is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| So, from that standpoint, I don't know if that's any help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| but that's sort of a snapshot of where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| With a little bit of luck, we'll have an agreement before this body in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| that will let us complete the project with Knox County serving as a project manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| and Mr. Cullum turning over to us the equipment that he had previously acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| and an amount of money that is still under discussion to help us cover some of the residual costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| So that's a snapshot of where we are as far as the historical piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| I think he has presented it in absolutely accurate terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| His contractor at the time was G.W. Wyatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| Mr. Wyatt did have equipment on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| They had the lanes marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| They were prepared to start moving dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| And the decision was made to suspend the project because of some concerns over the alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| And that certainly bogged it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| That is an indisputable history of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| There's not a month that doesn't go by that I don't get asked about when is that going to be finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| when is that going to be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Bud, you're right on the tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| We had talked about it early, but we did not do the tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| Which corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| I'm kind of familiar with Emery Road at Andersonville Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| Which corner, not property, which northwest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| The funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Which one had the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| The funeral home had the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| And we were stopped in a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| There's been a whole new plan that has ultimately resulted three years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| And it's completely beyond the scope of what the original approved plan was that we had started construction on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3966)|
| 1:06:14| Folks, if we could get back now to talking about University Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Thanks, Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| I really do commend you and Jim for your vision of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| It's been an amazing eyesore and vacant space for I don't know how many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=3992)|
| 1:06:40| Would you talk a little bit more about encapsulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| I will try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| First of all, let me preface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| I'm not an environmental engineer, and we will have an environmental engineer that can be available next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| But encapsulation, the way I understand it, is there are times when you have a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4015)|
| 1:07:03| where the best method is to dig out and take to an environmental landfill and then replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4023)|
| 1:07:14| There are other times when it is decided that instead of doing that, trap it where it is and keep it from migrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4034)|
| 1:07:24| And that was what TDEC decided that because of the exact nature of this site, what was best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| the holes we do drill for the caissons, every bit of that dirt will be tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4051)|
| 1:07:38| and, if needed, taken to an environmental landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| Not only that, but then what we are doing as a part of the development is we are installing what are known as water quality units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4062)|
| 1:07:50| so that all rainwater right now that is hitting that site, even though there are slabs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| and it may just be running off into the creek, some of it is still getting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| and has the potential of taking more of those contaminants into the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| Our situation will be that our rainwater will be captured through these water quality units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| and go through that and be treated before it can get into the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| and certainly before it can actually get into the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| and penetrate any of the contaminants that may or may not be in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| So the contaminants themselves, were they buried or were they leakage into soil or combinations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4103)|
| 1:08:31| I think probably, I think it was just over the years, just the solvents that they used in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| that it just drained, whether it was through washing the floors and letting the water go out onto the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| Okay, has TDEC mapped the site in terms of contamination and they know what's where pretty much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| Oh, yeah. TDEC, they have been monitoring wells on this site for, I think, the last seven or eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| TDEC has been monitoring that, working with the existing landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| And our whole process with TDEC involved not only all of the studies that had already gone on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| but we had to prepare about a 50-page environmental safety and health plan that details to the nth degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| every single thing that happens on that property during a construction phase, what can happen and what can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| We've also had to enter into land use restrictions that are actually recorded in the form of deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| as to what can and can't happen on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| And then we are ready to, we have negotiated and actually have what is known as a brownfield agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| that will be signed by TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| But, no, they have signed off on the entire plan from where we are right now to the finished construction of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| I'm sure you've already investigated responsibility in terms of the previous landowner and such as to the cleanup phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4193)|
| 1:10:02| I mean, I don't know anything about that, but I'm sure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| The previous landowner, our contractual relationship and post-closing, if we're successful in doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| that for any items that could potentially pose a liability, financial liability, that they will be on the hook for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4215)|
| 1:10:25| If it's something that after we took title to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| if we did something that violated any of the land use restrictions, deed restrictions, or TDEC restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4228)|
| 1:10:35| then at that point it would be our liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| But they're still in the chain, the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| And so far, I might commend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| They have been, they have taken TDEC's requirements and suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| and added a few of their own that probably go further beyond even what TDEC would have required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| So they've taken it very seriously, their environmental liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| Okay. The other environmental concern, of course, is Third Creek Greenway and just the water issues that go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| The Fulton Bellows site was one that obviously had no consideration whatsoever for anything green or water or any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4266)|
| 1:11:18| I don't know how old that is. I guess it's close to 100 years old or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| Right about 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Okay. And so I was wondering, in your plan, were you able to enhance that area that's behind you that is part of the greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4283)|
| 1:11:33| And certainly the university is trying to do it on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| Right. Our plan, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Our plan, first of all, we think by putting a nice structure versus what is currently there is the first enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| The second part is, as I mentioned with the water quality units, we will be enhancing the water that will be coming into the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4306)|
| 1:11:53| Post-development will be much better than what's going into the creek now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| Then the third thing that we want to do is, even though there will be access from the greenway via Joe Johnson to our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4317)|
| 1:12:07| we're going to work with TVA, believe it or not this would be TVA controlled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| to see about doing at least one, if not two, wooden bridges, as you've seen on a lot of the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| so that on either end, if you're on the greenway and wanted to access our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| and then back to the greenway that you would be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| Yeah, that would make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| I mean, bike traffic and pedestrian traffic, I mean, that would be a nice addition to the thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4350)|
| 1:12:38| That's something, essentially what is required by that is we have to come up with probably an arch bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| and do some calculations and send it to TVA and let TVA make sure that in a flooding event that that bridge doesn't cause problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4365)|
| 1:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| I'm actually just following up a little bit on Tony there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| There is not going to be a greenway on the east side of the waterway then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4381)|
| 1:13:09| Right now, all the way from Kingston Pike south, there is a city greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| It's asphalt, I think, about six foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Will there be anything like that on your side of the creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| No, but, I mean, once it got past our – I mean, it's on the one side of the creek already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| I think it would be a little duplicitous to have another identical one right on the other side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| But if we can have the bridge that I was just referring to, we think that would be good because if someone wanted –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| if they were on the greenway and wanted to access our development versus going all the way up to Joe Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| and then back down the new bridge is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| But as far as the greenway, doing another separate greenway, that is not planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| I didn't know if the city may have been asking for a trail or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| No, I think they're thought now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| I guess if we get those bridges, there would be some greenway added from the standpoint that we would build sidewalks up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| from that bridge to the proper point where someone could access, say, a restaurant at our development or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4447)|
| 1:14:14| You're going to keep the smokestack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| We hope to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| I mean, we think that that adds character to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Some people may say, no, take the smokestack down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| But we actually have two proposals, engineering proposals, to study that to make sure of the structural integrity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4463)|
| 1:14:31| So what's your thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Would you like to see that kept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Yes, you could offer a thrill ride there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| You could elevate people to the top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Have a zip line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| They could have a zip line or a airdrop or a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| Commissioner McPherson, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Bud or for Arthur, can we have one more of your printouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| I had to give it to the girls up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| If you've got an extra one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| We had to give one to the girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| You know, you all know I love brownfield development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| I really love brownfield development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| But, boy, I hate Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| So I'm going to pass on this just because I know I'm going to get questions this week from constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4517)|
| 1:15:25| and I want to be able to make sure that this is discussed again on Monday so that we can ask some more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| So I don't want anybody to assume that my passing on this is an automatic no because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| And I appreciate the hoops and nightmare of trying to coordinate everything that you've had to go through with getting all this set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4537)|
| 1:15:48| I applaud what you're doing with, you know, the encapsulation and the green brownfield and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| But I know there's going to be more questions before Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| If you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| And, Commissioner Burroughs, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| And I touched on this earlier, but I want to make one thing very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| People tend to say Walmart's the largest corporation in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| Why are we giving them our taxpayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| Why are the taxpayers of Knox County giving money to Walmart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| And I want to be very clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| The taxpayers aren't giving anything because right now the taxpayers are getting $6,800 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| And with this particular site, it's conceivable that's what it could be for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| I'm not suggesting that there's not some deal that could come along and take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| I don't think from a jobs creation or a financially stable for the long term or for a sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4600)|
| 1:16:49| or, for that matter, even the initial property tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| I don't think that there's something as what we have put together that would come along for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| The other thing to point out, again, is Walmart, if we open this in July of 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4620)|
| 1:17:08| it gets reassessed and the taxes are paid as to what that reassessment would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4628)|
| 1:17:15| And we feel like, conservatively, it's going to be approximately $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Appraisal gets assessed at 40 percent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| So a $20 million assessment versus what currently is a $290,000 versus $20 million on the actual what you get to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4642)|
| 1:17:39| and apply the tax rate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| When Walmart and Publix and the other shops open, they will be paying the taxes, the full taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| just as where there was no TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| So they are not getting, Walmart and Publix are not getting any handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| The handout, if you want to call it a handout, comes to us so that we can build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| Walmart and Publix are both paying a higher rent than I ever dreamed they would ever agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| They have stretched to the point where anything beyond that, they just can't do the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| and get any kind of a return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| It comes down to what we have then is, okay, we have a $226 million economic impact with 1,100 permanent jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| 600 construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| We are taking a blighted brownfield and turning it into something that we think will look great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| It gives students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| It gives Fort Sanders people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| It gives Alcoa Highway people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| It gives inner city people the opportunity to have decent shopping right near where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| Well, and I appreciate all those arguments, and I'm not understanding about Walmart's not getting the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4719)|
| 1:18:47| But when we're considering economic impact and jobs created, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| jobs created at Walmart aren't a whole lot better than no job at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| considering on what it ends up costing us in terms of increased taxes for health care for their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| and food stamps for their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| And Walmart just they're horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| So I understand we're not giving them the handout, but I don't care to support them in any way, shape or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| I also appreciate that at the beginning you were real honest with us about you're not going to try to fool us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| by claiming that there's going to be any increased sales tax generated by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| that it's mostly you're not suggesting that people are going to go buy more groceries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| or maybe they'll buy more cheap plastic crap than they did before from Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| But pretty much sales tax revenue is not going to go up tremendously from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| Now, I am excited about Publix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| From my work on the Food Policy Council, I'm very familiar with the problem with food deserts, especially in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| So, again, I'm excited about this for a lot of reasons, but I do have some hesitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| and I know that people I represent are going to have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| and I want to talk about this again on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| And I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| I think the --well, I lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| I have that effect on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Your estimated retail sales after the project is complete is $80 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| Now, that I'm assuming is Walmart and Publix together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| And the shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| And the shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| Now, are you looking at any increase in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| Is that year one, or is that just going to be an average of 80 for the next, say, first five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| No, I think that would increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| I think that's a conservative number also, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| And that also jogged my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| Commissioner Burwell, what I was going to say is, yes, I did say I'm not going to try to fool you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| and say that that's all going to be new, but I think some of it will be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| I don't think it's fair to say that there won't be any new, especially as it relates to this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| especially as it relates to an entirely one of the tenants is an entirely new tenant to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| But, Commissioner Hammond, yes, we would certainly expect that that would go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| I mean, historically, unless it's been the recession that we've had for two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| historically sales tax go up every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| And one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Commissioner Burwell passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| But I'll get with you, Arthur, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Everyone else votes aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Can I make another motion that we pass it with no recommendation to money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4892)|
| 1:21:39| until we can have his engineers and so forth here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| Well, we've already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| We've already voted to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| I mean, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| It didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| No, it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| It's going to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| Only had one no and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| This keeps it all consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| That was my question is if we voted today and it goes on consent, then we wouldn't be discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| That was just a question I had about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| So it will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| I took care of you boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| I took care of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Can I ask one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Maybe I should just ask Arthur this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| This still gets voted on again next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| This was just to vote whether to send it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| We have a whole other set of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| We'll have our dog and pony show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| Bottom line is the commission has voted in favor, but you had one no and one pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| so it will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| It will be discussed on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| May I ask, I know Commissioner McKenzie wants the engineering report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| Is there any other information we can provide in the meantime to the commission that we have not already provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4953)|
| 1:22:41| I'm looking at tax return on the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| I think Bud said a while ago he could do a two-page summary of the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4966)|
| 1:22:55| I think rather than just giving that to Commissioner McKenzie who asked for it, I think that should go to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| We'll say the executive summary with his comments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| If not, we'll move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| Item number 31, ordinance to amend the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| Chapter 2, Article 10, Division 9, Sections 2-877, 2-878, and 2-879| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| to increase the terms of office of members of the Health Insurance Appeal Board to four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| and to provide for the election of employee representatives on said board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| to coincide with the election of employees' elected representatives on the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| Ordinance number 0-07-11-102, adopted December 17, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| I have a question, I guess, Dr. Buchanan or Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| You're not back there, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| I thought you were doing risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| Just an informational question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| Anybody on this appeals board, are they on the Retirement and Pension Board also or only by coincidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5048)|
| 1:24:17| or are they an ex-officio member or what's the status of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| It's my belief that no one's on the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| That's on the Insurance Appeal Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| Two totally separate boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| There's three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| It's Tim Wheeler, John Duncan, the pharmacist at the Health Department, and Dorothy Barnes are the members of the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5073)|
| 1:24:43| So why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| If they're two separate entities, why it's imperative that maybe for your record keeping or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| their terms coincide with the Pension Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| It was an insurance committee recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| And it was done just to facilitate the election among employees at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| That's just a simple thing so we wouldn't have to have two elections and set everything up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| And that's the only reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| It's just a housekeeping order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| That's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| I'm on the insurance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| Item number thirty-three is discussion regarding a joint venture between Knox County and the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| for the installation of sidewalks around Bearden Middle School, West Hills Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| Pond Gap Elementary School and West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| Commissioner Olenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Thank you very much, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| I gave packets out with Jolie's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| She helped me put these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| And Amy, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| This is a venture that I think that the city and the county can venture together around some of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5158)|
| 1:26:09| that our children are having to walk especially quite a distance, Pond Gap in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5169)|
| 1:26:18| A lot of the kids, because of their after-school program, have to walk home to cross the street from West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5178)|
| 1:26:27| the apartments up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| And it is in dire need of having sidewalks on the side heading east on Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5190)|
| 1:26:43| For one, there's a lot of undefined entrances coming in and out of some of the businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5203)|
| 1:26:52| Pilot and Holy Land Market and all them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| The design has already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| UT is going to help pay for some of the crosswalks at the intersection of Hollywood and Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5220)|
| 1:27:09| But this way it keeps the kids from having, while the construction is going on, of crossing Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| walking down to West High School and having to cross back over to get to the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| It's a very busy traffic, especially at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| I don't know if anybody's been on Sutherland Avenue at 5 o'clock, but it's very, very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| There's no crossing guards there after a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| And I just think that this is a good way for the city and the county to venture together to get this sidewalk built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5259)|
| 1:27:48| get some defined entrances for these stores up and down Sutherland Avenue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5268)|
| 1:27:58| But the total cost is in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| It's roughly going to be about $400,000 roughly of county money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| and then the city is going to match, and then UT is matching some other funds for the crosswalks and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5289)|
| 1:28:16| And I'd also, the reason I wanted to do this discussion is to kind of see how everybody felt on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5296)|
| 1:28:25| Pond Gap, especially that sidewalk going up Hollywood, is very narrow, and it's just very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| That needs to be redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| This will also connect Greenways at Third Creek and West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| It will on down to Bearden Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| The other one was finishing the sidewalks on Sheffield Road, which leads from, it was started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| and it goes about a block up Sheffield Road from West Hills heading east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| and then this would connect the sidewalk at Wesley Road, which connects Bearden Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| So it gives those walkers as well as students that have to walk home from Bearden and West Hills a little safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5343)|
| 1:29:14| because Sheffield Road is a very busy street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| And it will connect the G&T Greenway to that community on West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| So I was just opening this up for discussion to see how everybody felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| I'd like to ask the mayor to consider this venture with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5368)|
| 1:29:36| It would hold down the cost on their side as well as on the county side to getting these done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| Jim, can I stop you, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| I know there's a lot of parental responsibilities on it, and this is really basically, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| we've imposed, the state's imposed a parental responsibilities on it, and the county has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| Will this assist around Sutherland Avenue's parental responsibilities on Hollywood and all that down through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| Right now it's the parental responsibility for those apartments that are out there across from West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| They're within that zone, and they have to walk home down Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| And it's also Cagle Terrace with the Dollar General opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| This gives Cagle Terrace residents that use the hover rounds and from crossing the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5417)|
| 1:30:26| they can just go straight down and connect to Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| So I think it is something that's beneficial to our citizens as well as to our school children for those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5431)|
| 1:30:38| You mentioned the – I know in that area you have a lot of people with hover rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| And so anything that could help with that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| This plan only asks for it to extend just down to Jade Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| I would like to ask the county and the city to extend it all the way down to the sidewalk that's built in front of that Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5452)|
| 1:31:01| It's a new strip center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| There's a little strip there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| So you're talking about another block that it would have to go, that sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| But I'd like to see it extended all the way for the safety reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| Senator McKenzie had his line before I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| I'll yield to Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| A lot of this is within my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| But I'm having some issues with it in that are we starting to get sidewalks, city sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5488)|
| 1:31:36| I mean, I think fundamentally there's just been a pond that we've not played in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| And, you know, I just don't know whether we're going to open up Pandora's box with this thing, sidewalks around schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5502)|
| 1:31:54| You know, the city has good sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| I mean, we have a lot of them in the city, and, you know, we're all pretty fortunate, those of us that represent city constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| But for the county to start getting into this infrastructure funding, I'm just wondering whether this is a good road to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5525)|
| 1:32:18| because this will not be the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| And I think we all need to get our arms around what we're considering here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5540)|
| 1:32:32| There's available sidewalks in that area, and I understand there may not be in the best shape of the proper widths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| and lead to where, you know, more conveniently where they need to go because of the business growth in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| But I guess I'm just wondering, is this a venture that we're wanting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| And I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| I'm not deciding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| This is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| I'm just wondering whether this is a proper use of good use or most efficient use of county resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5576)|
| 1:33:05| So just throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| I like what Commissioner Olmey is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| Would you take a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| I mean, everything is going to the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| What about letting them get back to us and prioritizing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| Rather than everything go to the 4th District, there might be something that's needed in the 9th District that's just as bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| Or let's look at prioritizing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| Because there's going to be limited money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| And if we send it all just to one district, we as other commissioners are going to get hit up with it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| So what about a study on that, Jeff, and let them come back with us and let us know where the biggest needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5618)|
| 1:33:45| And let's start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Let's fix the worst problems first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| Actually, both of these sidewalks, the one on Hollywood and the one on Southern Avenue, are not in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5630)|
| 1:33:58| They're actually on the opposite side of the road, which is not in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| This was brought to me from Beardman Council that had done all the legwork, done all the research, got UT to pay for the crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5642)|
| 1:34:12| And they came to the city to fund the sidewalk on the one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5652)|
| 1:34:22| And I just made the suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| And, you know, I've spoken to both mayors about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| The Sheffield Road one sidewalk is not high enough on their list, and that's not a top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5670)|
| 1:34:38| I just did make the suggestion at the mayor that it does connect to schools, that that one does need to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5678)|
| 1:34:45| But this one is, I think, because of the safety of our elderly on Cagle Terrace, which is in the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5685)|
| 1:34:55| and those children that it does involve to schools that are county's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5695)|
| 1:35:02| Maybe that's something, you know, Jim Snowden could get back to us and say, here's our priority areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| And if they happen to be some in the city where we can get some city money, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| But would you offer a friendly amendment that would prioritize all the look at the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5713)|
| 1:35:20| We don't even have a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| I'm asking for a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| I'm just trying to get the feel of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| And I understand, you know, city sidewalks are not our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| But with everybody being strapped for money, I just thought this is a way of protecting our students that have to walk within that parental responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5731)|
| 1:35:42| And when that park, the soccer field is open there on Sutherland, there's going to be a lot more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5742)|
| 1:35:49| And some child is going to get hit, or we're going to have another elderly that's going to get hit on Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5749)|
| 1:35:57| Just something to think about between now and next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| You know, I really agree with what did Sam leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| I really sort of agree with what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| I think we're really going down a road on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| If we're going to get some funds for this, I've probably, probably once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| someone asks me to see if we can get money for sidewalks or street lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| And it deals with schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| I mean, we need some sidewalks around some of the schools in Farragut and over at AL Lots and some of these other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| And I've pretty much not even referred those or brought those here because the policy for the county has been is we don't do sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| I've had neighborhoods wanting to put in some street lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| I had one just recently at an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| It turned out it was in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| And it was where they wanted this, out there around Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| And, you know, I've been pretty firm in saying, you know, we don't do sidewalks and we don't do street lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| And if we're going to do that, I think we better start talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| because there's a lot of places that could use sidewalks and street lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| is that we ought to go ahead right now and start talking about how much the tax increase is going to be to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| And it may be bigger than the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| This is a discussion item, so we will not be discussing it on Monday unless, you know, if you'd like, we can always bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| But, Mr. Vandervee, did you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| Mr. Chairman, just briefly, one of the things that I thought might be useful is I'll put some numbers together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| I've actually been looking through the city of Knoxville's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And I guess if I want to do anything for the commission, I was thinking about Commissioner Smith's thoughts on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| and that's create reasonable expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| To start with, we do not look at traffic conditions in and around schools that are inside the corporate limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5855)|
| 1:37:42| That is the responsibility of city officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| They maintain their roads and we maintain ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| And it would be out of line for me to involve myself in those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| So, for input on traffic conditions in and around city schools, that's information we would want to solicit from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5875)|
| 1:38:03| Two, and I'll try to have some numbers for this body by Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| I do think, as a frame of reference, you should understand that, for instance, with resurfacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| since we've talked about it today for state-aid roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| the city has budgeted around $5 million in their current FY12 budget for resurfacing of roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5897)|
| 1:38:26| In our account, which governs those expenses, which is called construction heavy maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| we have $2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| That includes the funds that we use to provide salt and cover the cost of our winter weather response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| So, certainly we want to be good partners in government and we want to help anywhere we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5919)|
| 1:38:46| but we will not be financially a viable answer to all of the questions that have been circulating among the body today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5926)|
| 1:38:55| So I did want to set some context and just say I hope everybody would look to us with reasonable expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| as to what we might be able to do and how we might be able to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| And I will try to have some hard numbers for you on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Hey, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| There was a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| There was a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| I had a question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| If the chairman doesn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5973)|
| 1:39:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| There was a large one that's bigger than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| Is that the one for $450,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| That's the one with the state aid that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| That's moving that for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| I saw the number and I didn't recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| Give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| It's Caldwell 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| That motion is approved on line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| That's all of the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Now, we do have one individual who has asked to address commission on an item that is not on our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| So we'd like to give you that opportunity, Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| If you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| I'm Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| I'm 133 Cogdill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| I live out in West Knoxville in Commissioner Briggs' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| I want to speak to you for a minute about the school budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| I've been following the discussion in the news about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| And I want to give you a perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| I think there's been quite a bit of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| Right now, the schools spend about $8,000 per student, our schools, Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6049)|
| 1:40:56| I know that others have given you comparisons with other public schools in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| But I took a look at what private schools are spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| And generally, they're around $10,000 per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| If you want to send your kid to a private school, most of them are $10,000 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| Webb's more like $16,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| So I look at that and I say, you know, Knox County is doing a pretty efficient job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| And then I think about, well, you know, those private schools aren't taking any low-income kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| They're taking practically no handicapped kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| One in 12 of no, one in eight of our Knox County students have some kind of educational disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6094)|
| 1:41:42| Practically nobody that goes to a private school is that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| What we are doing, I just can't help but conclude that our schools are tremendously efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| We are doing a heck of a lot on very little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6113)|
| 1:42:00| You know, but I don't, but I think if the kids who go to private schools are worth $10,000 tuition a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6120)|
| 1:42:11| our kids are worth every bit that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| I don't think that we should rest content spending $8,000 a year when the kids have got needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6136)|
| 1:42:24| The school board has come to you and asked for $35 million more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| That $35 million works out to maybe about $600 per student, school, year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6150)|
| 1:42:40| $600 per kid sounds like a lot, but it's still way short of spending $10,000 that it costs to send a kid to private school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6160)|
| 1:42:49| Looking at it from that point of view, it looks to me mighty reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| Now, some of the other discussion I've heard about this stuff is that, oh, man, the tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| So I got out my pencil and paper and looked at that, and gee whiz, you know, they're talking $35 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6180)|
| 1:43:08| So that's going to mean that for somebody who lives in a $400,000 McMansion, it will cost them $350,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6188)|
| 1:43:20| an additional $350 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| Now, I'm having a hard time believing somebody who lives in a $400,000 house can't swing another $350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| Basically, less than a dollar a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| The average house price in our area is about $160,000 or the median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6213)|
| 1:43:41| So that's like 40 cents a day that's going to cost people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| I'd say our students and our public schools are worth every bit of 40 cents a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6225)|
| 1:43:52| So I don't buy the idea that we can't afford to provide the money that the school board thinks they need to do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6232)|
| 1:44:07| There's also been, I've heard some talk about, well, we should pay for this with a sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| So those people passing through from Ohio and Kentucky can help us pay for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| Well, frankly, that's just plain embarrassing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| You know, these are our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| They're not the Kentucky and Ohio children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| They're ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| And it's our responsibility to educate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| It's not theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| So I, for one, think, you know, I'm here to tell you that I'm happy to pay my increase in sales tax to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6271)|
| 1:44:38| And I think if people decide we can't afford to do this, that's just telling me that they think our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6278)|
| 1:44:46| and the public schools aren't worth what the kids who go to private schools are worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| One comment, and this is just for completeness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| I like your evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| I like things that are well thought out, and I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| Transportation costs are part of that $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| So I just wanted to point that out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| And in private schools, I don't think we have a private school here that provides transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| No other business to come before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| We are adjourned until next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120416?start=6316)|
