| 0:00:00| Fifty-one percent of that might be 800 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| Well, if we set our threshold at 1,500 votes or whatever is highest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3)|
| 0:00:08| then they would have to get that higher number instead of what the 51 percent would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8)|
| 0:00:13| And we can make that threshold number whatever we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=13)|
| 0:00:16| And that would keep that would solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:22| We have two more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=22)|
| 0:00:24| I would like to go ahead and get rid of the first part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=24)|
| 0:00:27| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=29)|
| 0:00:30| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=30)|
| 0:00:32| If you'll just take two sheets, the one that says 66.67 percent of votes cast per office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=32)|
| 0:00:38| and look at that other sheet that gives you your 15 percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=38)|
| 0:00:44| That's the two of the ones, choices we have that are the closest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=44)|
| 0:00:49| But there is still a great disparity in those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| In two districts, first and when was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=56)|
| 0:01:04| Anyway, but that's the closest thing that we've got would be 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| This 50 percent in the last election is too low, absolutely too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=68)|
| 0:01:18| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Yes, Mr. Chairman, I will be brief because I want to go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| But I would like to say to Greg and Scott, if I might take a point of privilege here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| don't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| I was talking with the eighth district folks over there just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| I'd like to have a discussion about Mr. Phillips' replacement today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| And Mr. Jarrett is getting some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| But I think that now that we do have a vacancy, since we're all here, so don't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| And I'll call for the question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Does everybody understand the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| We're splitting the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| We're taking care of all the procedural matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| Can I clarify real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| We're going to vote on this part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| and then we're going to try to come to a consensus on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| And if we're able to do that, then we'll come back and vote on the whole ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| So both have to we have to pass this, we have to pass the other, then we come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| So if we don't pass the numbers, we're still at ground zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Now we can deal with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Greg, I still want to get my arms around this gubernatorial thing in the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| So the only issue we have is school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Is that right, as far as using that as a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Yes, because county commission cannot split a precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| So let's say that, okay, I voted Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| I have Cedar Bluff North and Cedar Bluff South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Cedar Bluff North may have one candidate for school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Cedar Bluff South may have another candidate for school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Why can't you use the Cedar Bluff South figures for that school board person and Cedar Bluff North?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| I mean, even though that's a split precinct, I'm still trying to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| Well, it's really not a split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| It's two precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| One of them is called Cedar Bluff North and the other one is called Cedar Bluff South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| A split precinct is like 16th Bell Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| I think it's a split precinct, isn't it, for school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| Some of the people that come in to vote there vote in one school board district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| Some vote in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| We can tell which school board district they vote in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| We can tell how many votes each school board, but we cannot tell how many of those people in each of the sections of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| precinct voted in the governor's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| We can tell how many in the whole precinct voted, but we can't break it down because of secret ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| So the part of the question that we're dealing with right now is the database of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=225)|
| 0:03:54| Whether or not we use gubernatorial, whether or not we use registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| or whether or not we use the number of people that voted for that office last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:10| And I think this is my opinion, that two of those fall out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| Well, one just falls out because the election commission can't deal with a split machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=254)|
| 0:04:25| I think that the who voted in the last election falls out because if it's an unopposed campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:34| there might not be many votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| If in the seventh district there's six people on the ballot or nine people on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:45| and they even bring in a few people from Maynardville to vote, the number is going to be extremely large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=285)|
| 0:04:54| Who's driving the bus, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| So that I'm asking for us to discount two of them because of the fluctuation, a fluctuation in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=296)|
| 0:05:05| and unacceptability of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| True, the number of registered voters could be incorrect, but it travels along a normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=309)|
| 0:05:21| People register to vote every day that the office is open, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| And every day the office finds reason to remove from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| or rearrange the number of people that are on that particular database of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| But in general terms, it probably does not fluctuate much because people are just adding names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:47| names are falling off, and it continues down sort of a common trail, a little bit of consistency to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| So I would like to see us use that as the database of record, that being number of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=355)|
| 0:06:04| And if we could, just pause for a second and poll ourselves here and see if that could be the database of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:15| that we would like to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| Commissioner, is that 10 percent of the registered voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| No, I'm not saying anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Oh, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| You're just saying, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| I'm just saying which of the three databases is the best database to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Commissioner McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| And can we split the question again and vote on the database of record and then vote on the percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:40| Well, I have some comments on it before we go any further, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Well, I don't know if Commissioner Wright had a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| I thought with the comment that I made that the Election Commission stood up to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| If we could allow him to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| If you do decide to use the number of registered voters, there's always been a question in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| and we don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| When someone brings a petition in that's tied to the number of registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| at what date do you count that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Because as he mentioned, it changes every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| So if you do decide to use that, pick a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| Pick January 1st of the beginning of the year that the petition comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| or pick a date and time so that we know for sure exactly what that number is because it changes every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| But it doesn't change on January 1st because we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| It doesn't change on Christmas Day or happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| So pick a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| And I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| And everybody will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| It's a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Because the question could be, does it have to be the day they turn in the petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Does it have to be the day they turn in the signatures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Or does it have to be the day of the election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Or the day we approve the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| So there's lots of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| But January 1st would be the date to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Pick something and then everybody will know exactly what the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| Greg, do you run a monthly report of registered voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Or is there a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Do you have a monthly report that you run of the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| We run a six-month report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| But we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| You can run a monthly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| And we can say the previous month's report in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| Well, you'd have to pick a time if we were open because it changes throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| That's the advantage of January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Or you can make it the first day of the calendar year at midnight or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| But it changes minute to minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| So keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| Will you finish, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| As Greg McKay alluded to, state law specifically says county commission districts cannot be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| For some reason, state law is silent when it comes to school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| And for whatever reason, the school board has come up with districts where they're split eight out of nine times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| Quite frankly, I think it disenfranchises many, many voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| Whether they're getting fair representation, if they're out in this little bubble out to the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| or if they wish to run because they're in a bubble out to the side and don't live in the larger bubble of where most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| of the people live in that particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| That's a different scenario, and I think we should address that if it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| But we'll do that at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| The school board is a different election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| It's nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| All elections in Knox County, except for school board, are partisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| And as such, there tends to mostly be contested races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| On occasion, sometimes one party doesn't have a candidate, and we do have uncontested races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| And that's why I wanted to have a standard that was equal across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| If it's a countywide office, it shouldn't matter whether they ran unopposed or opposed as far as the number of signatures required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=596)|
| 0:10:08| That's why I was in favor of the gubernatorial, because it was fair across all offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| I think because of the nature of how the school board is elected that possibly we could have a different database for the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:25| because they will always be unopposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| Because they run in a primary, and if they're victorious there, they go to the general election unopposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=629)|
| 0:10:39| which is, I think, why we have a problem, or at least that's one of my problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| is trying to come up with a number for an unopposed, not candidate, but office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| And it might be possible that we should have for everything but school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| but if we could use the gubernatorial, could we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Point of order, Mr. LeCru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| You say they run unopposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| They go in the primary, the top two come out, and they run in the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Not if they're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Unless there's 51 percent of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Unless there's 51 percent of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Fifty plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Most of the we have yet to have a contested general election for school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| But it's still nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| It's just a thought here that if we used votes cast in a school board, whatever the percentage is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:31| and then for all others, we use the gubernatorial, and we can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| Because I do think that the school board is a different beast in the fact that it is a nonpartisan election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| And I had a question for Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| In a partisan election, if, let's say, one of the candidates were to pass away or could not be on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=710)|
| 0:12:01| from the date of the primary to the general, the party that was, that lost that candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| would come up with a way to nominate someone else for the general election, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| That depends on the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| But if there's enough time, they could come up with someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| Otherwise, that name remains on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| If someone dies and they're on the ballot and it's too late, they just remain on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| But if there is that little window there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| I think there's a window that there can be a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| I could be wrong about that, but I think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| But what about school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| It's nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| I'd really have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| So, I mean, here again, that just sort of gets back to my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| It's a different beast being a nonpartisan race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| And I don't see any reason why we can't use a different standard for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| And that's just an idea I was going to throw out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| I think if there was time, then there would be a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| I'd have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| But there's not a party system to put another candidate in there when it's nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| Nominee, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| So I'm just throwing that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| We could use votes cast in the election that elected that school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| And we could use gubernatorial for all other offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| I was looking at double standard or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| The cast takes $39,000 for a countywide election right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| That's the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Last month we voted on 25% of gubernatorial, which would have made it $30,000 for the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:46| I'm going to make a motion that we make it 10% of the registered voters, which would make it 26-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| January 1, just to get something on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| And then we would take the January 1st number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| No, there was not a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| There was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| And the only problem is we can say we can pick the number of people that are registered voters on the rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| but that number may not actually be the number of registered voters unless on January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| that's when the purged list comes out because there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| I don't know what the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| How many people when you purge the election list, how many names come off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| It varies greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| We just did a purge last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| There were only 386 names purged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| And you do that once a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| We usually wait every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| We wait until after the city election just in case someone wants to vote in the city election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Then we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| You know, I guess, you know, the only problem is what if it turns out to be close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| and somebody's off a little bit or they get the number of signatures and then the guy claims, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| some of these people haven't even lived here in two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| They moved away and they're going to be on the list, but they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| I'm going to make a substitute motion that we use 60 percent of the votes cast in that office for that election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:27| with a minimum for school board and commission elections of 2,000 votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| and the minimum for a threshold or a minimum of 20,000 votes on a countywide election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| So this is 60 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| On the countywide, 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| This is 60 percent of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Yeah, we've got this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| It's on the list right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| 60 percent of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Of the number of votes cast in the election in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| So I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Let there be a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| Do you have some more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| The chairman can't make a motion anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| I was just trying to push his thing through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Hey, Scott, Scott, do you have any more of those long forms that you handed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| They're right up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Let me just tell you why I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| I hope that this satisfies a lot of people because what it does, it doesn't make it too easy because even in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=979)|
| 0:16:29| district and several of these districts, one, two, three, four of the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| that minimum is more than what it would be for 60 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| And then that would take care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| It's pretty close on almost all of the countywide elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| As a matter of fact, I think it covers all of them from what I see just about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| But that way we can, if you look at this 25 percent of the vote that we talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| I think that covers just about everyone actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| You know, with the 20,000 minimum, that actually helps the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| and it also I believe helps the, I don't see the law directors on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| but I think it helps him also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| It makes it more difficult than what we would have had otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Looking at it, Dr. Briggs, 60 percent and what I see is roughly the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| It's pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| 26-1 and 26-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| I think the advantages of this is what it solves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| One, you're dealing with a number that cannot be contested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| You know, we said we wanted to avoid any legal challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| That satisfies that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| It keeps it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| You know, I hate to say when we start making all these different exceptions for the school board and all like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| it starts to look like this is something that was put together by a committee, which it is, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| But, you know, keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| And then, you know, it's the same standard for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| It makes it, it decreases substantially from the 15 percent number that we were using before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1076)|
| 0:18:07| And then, finally, to satisfy people who are concerned about elections where there's a low turnout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| or some of those others, I think it satisfies them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| And if you're looking at nationwide, where I'm not going to say it's the standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| but there's more states have this than anywhere else is 25 percent of the vote in the election in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| We've got, it's not quite, it's probably about two and a quarter of what that standard is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:36| I got an income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Did someone second Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| It was second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| No, I withdrew my motion through either the regular motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| I think it's the same thing as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| Ten percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| So you're making a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Ten percent of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| You said ten percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Here's the problem I have with using registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| As Dr. Briggs said, we want to make this very difficult to challenge in the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| and with the fluctuations in the number of registered voters on a day-to-day or even minute-to-minute basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:27| Even if we choose a date, that could still be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| Also, you know, once somebody dies, they can stay on the voter rolls for years and years before they get purged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:40| I just think that it's not a realistic number of how many people you've got who are active in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:49| or in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| So I can't support using a number that's derived from the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| I just don't think that's a good standard to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| Tank, now your motion was January 1, too, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| I'll make a substitute motion for the motion that you withdrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| Well, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions about either one of the motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| substitute motion or the motion that Commissioner Briggs made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Is there a minimum number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| See, mine, the minimum number is 2,000 for commission district races and school board races| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| and 20,000 minimum for countywide races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| You know, I'd like just to point out that Commissioner Pinkston's proposal makes it easier to recall the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:45| than mine does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| And it also makes it easier to recall, well, I don't know about the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| but it makes it easier to recall the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| But it's fair straight across the board and everything, school board and everything, that would take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| Did you have something else, Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Ten percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| Also, January 1 of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| No, we need a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| It's got to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| You're in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| You're in question, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Make a pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| When you say you're in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Of the year in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| It's got to be January 1 of the year in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Whatever year you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| We need a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1304)|

| 0:24:10| We have to vote on the entire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Put them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Now this is going to be first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| This would, in my opinion, be first reading, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| So now what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| We're going to put both of the ordinances that we voted for, put them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| As a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| As a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| So it'll come back next month, but we won't have any more public forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| So just to be clear, we've cleared up the language, dealt with the majority issue, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| we're going to have 10% of registered voters be the number that we've set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| On January 1 of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1497)|

| 0:25:01| Is everyone...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| I guess someone needs to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| Well, no, that's part of the original motion, is to come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| That was my original motion, was that we split it, but then we had to come back to it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| vote it as an all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Well, we still have to have a motion to bring it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| My original motion was to split the question, but once you split it, you still have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| by Robert's rules of order, you still have to come back and vote on it as one entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I understand that, but I'm talking...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| I'd make a motion that we vote on this now as a first reading for the whole entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| You got one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Amy's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| I'm a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Craig and Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| The motion passes 16-2, first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1554)|
| 0:26:13| Mr. Chairman, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:44| I don't have a question, Mr. Chairman, at a point of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| I had mentioned earlier that while Mr. McKay and Scott are here, I think we need to suspend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| the rules and put on the agenda a discussion of this vacancy, which has just been created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| for the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| I don't know if you'd want to do that now or if you'd want to do that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| We've got to do it sometime tonight, so we might as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| I'll make a motion that we suspend the rules and add to the agenda a discussion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| vacancy of the school board in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| We have a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| All in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| We have to have a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| That needs a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| We need a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| It's to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Does anyone have a objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| We have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| If I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the Board, just to set the stage on this, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| default to the Tennessee Code relative to this announced vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Tennessee Code section 49.2.201 reads, in pertinent part, that vacancies occurring on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| the school board shall be filled by the local legislative body, that is, the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| Any person so appointed shall serve until a successor is elected and qualifies according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| to law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| The successor shall be elected at the next general election for which candidates have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| sufficient time to qualify under law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| And I think Mr. McKay can guide you on any of the specifics from there, but that's essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| you make the appointment until such time that person qualifies and a successor is elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| in the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Mr. Jarrett, is he officially resigned without turning in something to his board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Well, he's announced his resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| I don't know if I have to look at the school board rules actually require a formal letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| of resignation, but at this point, he's announced his resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| You have an obligation under state law to appoint a successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| You don't have to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| You can have a vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| You can set a public hearing date, but, you know, essentially, I got the impression he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| went effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| I think that's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| I was just making sure we weren't putting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| You probably set up a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Mr. Chairman, if I may, I had the floor and I was happy to relinquish it, but Greg McKay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:15| with regards to the election process now, is there time for candidates to file petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| before February so they can do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| You know, we want to certainly consult with the state and the law director to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| that whatever we say is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| The qualifying deadline for the May primary and the August general is not until February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| 18th, which is, you know, it's not tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| It's not the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| There certainly seems to be time, but we want to, I've read through the law, but we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| to make sure that what we say is accurate before I say anything definite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| I also believe that under the state law, we have to make an appointment within 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| so we're looking at that process, and under our rules, we do accept resumes and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| have a public hearing, but I'll defer to my colleagues in the 8th District on any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| So thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Is it my understanding, Mr. McKay, that to qualify, what would be the deadline to qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| for the August election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| It should have to be the next general election, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Yes, it would be February the 18th is the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| But you're going to verify that just in case you said, or are you confident with that date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| I'm confident with that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| If you're running as an independent in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| This is a non-partisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Yeah, or a non-partisan, or if you're running as a party member in the May primary, either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| one, it's February 18th for county office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Wouldn't this be a special election, though, for this seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| It would, but it would be a special election run in conjunction with the other election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Is it still going to make the same qualifying deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Presumably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| You just found out about this, you know, 10 minutes ago, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:53| Do you have a question, Dr. Bridges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Yeah, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| What I'm wondering about is, can we set a rule like that we're only going to appoint folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| who agree not to run for that office, and is there a way to make it stick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| I know we've had, in the past, we've appointed folks to office, and then, you know, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| said they didn't intend to run, and then they changed their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| Is there any way that we can make that a requirement, and is there any way that we can make it stick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Because getting an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I don't have anything to do with your confirmation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| The state law is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| You make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| You can't do it with caveats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| You appoint someone, and if they ultimately say, I'm going to be a gatekeeper, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| change their mind, there's nothing under state law, and there's no contractual obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| you can foist on someone, because the statute, you know, it has to give it its plain interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| in the statutory construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| If the state wanted that, they would put it in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| It's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| So at this point, you appoint someone, until such time, she or he can qualify for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| general election, and your duty is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Commissioner Nauman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| I guess this is directed to Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| I'm just wondering what we're trying to solve here tonight, and I wonder also, using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| word stick, since Mr. Phillips was just so recently resigned, I wonder about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:37| he also could retract that resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| If that's so, then what are we doing, and why are we doing it, until this has been substantiated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:54| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Maybe, I'll tell you how I would answer it, I mean, I don't think anyone has, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| it doesn't mean that we're going to do it, and that he can't retract, I guess, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| think this is the last time this body will meet until the end of February, that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| have the opportunity to decide what mechanism we're going to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| I see that Mr. Hammond, I see that Mike Hammond stepped out, but I think that what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| decide on is that the person will, we will have an election, a primary in May, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| have a general election in August, and what we need to do is just set out what the steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| are, so the public knows those, if for no other reason than the people, because there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| will not be another meeting of us until after the February 18th deadline, so I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| good to set up what the mechanism is going to be, whether, you know, have a contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| plan, whether we have to execute that or not depends on, you know, what Mr. Phillips really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Does that sound fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| I would like to make a motion that we ask the Chairman to set up a public hearing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:16| hear candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| I think the 8th District deserves to have a school board representative as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| and I would like to have public hearings sometime by mid-February so that we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:36| that before us so that we could possibly vote on that at our February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| The 8th District is going to be without representation for at least one month, even doing it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| way, and leaving it at the discretion of the Chairman to come up with a special meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| have a public hearing so we can hear from these candidates, I think is the best way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| to do it, instead of trying, everybody pulling out their calendars and trying to say, I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| make this meeting or that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| I think he needs to just come up with a date that he feels is appropriate, and those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:14| can make it, make it, and if you can't, then you just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| And if he wants to have it here or in the 8th District, I would like to, if the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:28| in the 8th, the commissioners in the 8th District would like to have it in their district, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Or if they wish to have it down here so it can be on TV, that's fine with me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| But I think that the Chairman needs to go ahead and have the authority to call a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| called meeting so that we can have a public hearing to hear from the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| And probably hear so it can be televised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Mr. McKay, you'll get back with me after you talk to the State, won't you, as soon as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| And we'll issue something to the media so everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| So, I guess I need a second to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| What did you say, yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| That's the first time in 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| More than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| And I guess just remember part of my motion is, is that we do have this on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| for February to make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| So that was part of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| I think the issue we have been discussing two things, and I agree with my second with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| Cole as far as the 8th District and replacement goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| But everybody that wants to be a candidate has known that the election is coming up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| And they should be getting their petitions and should be deciding to run for state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| No, they wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| It wouldn't be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| It wouldn't be this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| No, this is mid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| He's only two years into it or getting to be two years into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Twelve would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Well, I agree with the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2225)|

| 0:41:43| Hey, self-release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Who wants to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Phil, I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| If these employees are hired, we only have a few months left in this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| If they're hired for the remainder of this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| is it possible to have the same salary that they're hired at now in effect for the next budget year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| Yes, I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Well, they would come in with that understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2527)|

| 0:42:16| I may have been now, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| You know, I guess one of the questions that I had when we looked at this is that you absolutely need the new software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| and just having gone through the reassessments and the letters and emails that we received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| which we really didn't have a whole lot to do about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| and I know you've got probably a thousand-fold more than that, is that we need to update the computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| I think we're looking at these things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| I guess the only question I had about the employees is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| and I don't know where they're going to find the money for this, at least in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| you made a very persuasive argument that the one fellow that's, you know, a trainer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| he's one of maybe three people in the country that can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| The others, you know, the others are, you know, I don't know how valuable they are as far as the rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:09| but I guess the question I bring up, just to try to keep us in some semblance of a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| is if we hired the one person who has all the credentials and qualifications and he's a trainer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| could we bring him on board and then over the course of time train other employees in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| who I think when Commissioner Pinkston brought it up, you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| really weren't in a position to be promoted into any of these jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| and then not necessarily hire the others just to try to keep us in budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| Because if we have a lot of people up there in the office that, you know, aren't qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| or can't be trained to, you know, to move up, do we need to create, you know, new positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| if we can't train some of the people that are already there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Well, you know, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| And, you know, the goal of this is to train all the employees to be able to move up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| Like I said, the goal is to give them career paths and steps, proper steps, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| equal with some of the other locations across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| But the purpose of this is to bring in people that can be trained now, that has some training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| You know, we're just now put on, really, for 17 people, the computers and the telephones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| The property assessor is divided into the mapping department, personal properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| sort of like in a little IT department, and into the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| So when you talk about training, if I had to take trainers out of the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| during all of this that's going on, you may not realize we've already looked at 49,000 parcels right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| So when you bring in the computer, it's very important that we get people online with some understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| And we're looking at people with 20 to 25 years' experience for these two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| And I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| We have to grow some and we have to hire some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| The last conversation that I had with a state certified general appraiser is that he came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| I told him our starting salary was $28,000, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| And he's making between $70,000 and $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| He had a need to come in because he had a special child and his wife was a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| And I looked at combining positions, we could go up to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| He came back to me and said, well, I'll take 50 if my wife will agree to work two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| Now, this is what I go against every day, to get the certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| You heard the phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And we have to go outside for two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| Another example is the paper was absolutely right on Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| What happened is we can have people with certain skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| The outside appraisers over on Forth and Gill picked up a place that had $100,000 on the 205 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:54| They picked up a little old patio, a shed, a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| It had $7,000 to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| Passed it on to the data entry people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| They did exactly what was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| But what we were missing was the level of supervision that all the rest of these counties are divided into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| We've got one for $17,000 and claims it's one for $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| But across the state, it appears it's one to four, one to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| We have no supervisors in commercial property, industrial property, greenbelt, land splits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| So this is the purpose of these people right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| But what happened is there was not that level that was able to say this house sold for $300,000 over the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| that it was now probably in the $200,000 range and we had $107,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| So these people have not been exposed to cross-training or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| So basically their training is they've got in a car with a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| And that's their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| And the great part is, I don't want you to think that we don't have great ability out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| Five members that went through the reappraisal had been through six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| So six times four, that's 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| But those people are leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| I can't take a 65-year-old and put them on a training program that we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| if we don't hire outside at this $60,000 to $110,000 range, that takes three years to get these certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| We can't put the time and money into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| These people here would come in with 20 to 25 years' experience and be our trainers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| and leave these people that went by that property 20 years and coordinate this gap that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| and use the gap between the field and the data entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| And, like I said, create these neighborhoods so that we have a more even way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| You can't have one to 17 doing commercial, residential, and land split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| And that's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Yes, this guy is great, but what if I don't get him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| I have to have a little flexibility on the pullback positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| There's several others that's capable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| But, you know, there's a time element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| It was hot a month ago, but what is he now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| And he does have everything that you would want, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| So I don't know that I've directly answered your question, but it's important to get these three people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| There's a possibility that our fallback is we would promote somebody with 29 years' experience there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| that's already doing the job and overseeing 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| But that would leave her position over to come back with somebody maybe that has these credentials at the $43 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| Maybe we can merge and shuffle money a little bit to bring in somebody like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| But every time that I talk to anybody that's certified, you know, it takes them two to three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| then it's $60,000 to $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| The best way is spend the money now and grow inside the minimum is three years for the first level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| which is the TCA, Tennessee Certified Appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Phil, I think you've done a great job with this department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| and there's no question that you need more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| and there's no question that you need to update your software and your equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| I don't doubt that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| My problem is that I don't understand where the money is going to come from to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| I mean, we just got a notice from the superintendent that they're going to need more money next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| And there's no question that your department does a great job with doing much more with much less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| than any other department in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| But we have a lot of departments in the county that are doing more with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| I mean, we need more codes inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| We don't pay our teachers what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| I can't, in good conscience, I would love to give you everything that you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| but I would love to give every department in the county everything that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| So I would offer a substitute motion to fund one additional employee so that you can get this guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:16| who sounds like he would be a huge asset and could do some training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| But I just can't, in good conscience, agree to three positions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| And I would hope that we could do better for you at budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| And I really apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| I have really struggled with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| I know you have, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| And really, you know, there was a brought to my attention a little recent news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| a little quirk that said that the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| that the average income across the state for a real estate appraiser or assessor of property was $47,860.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3050)|
| 0:51:00| Actual, you know, there's a difference of averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| It could be different things, different counties, different costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| Actual, for our 17 people, it's $33,401, a difference of $14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:13| We're below average of $33,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| Now, Paul Pinkston asked me to get him information on Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| You have it before you, Chattanooga and Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Our starting salary of $28,000 doesn't even begin to fit into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| Additional people will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| These people go out and do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| And speaking of the school system, there's no perfect way that I can describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| You know, what I would say is that if you've got 25 people in a classroom versus 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| and I don't know if the standard measure is teacups or whatever that it may be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| they've got 180 days to perform and get them up to a level, whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| We've got a time date on all these to get up to a certain level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| This is mass numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| You see we've got 17 people to look at 212,000 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| We've looked at 46,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| You see the state of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| We're coming on with new computer systems, going to have to have trainers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| We're going to have to have this level of intervention of supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| We don't even have one that every county has a commercial supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| You know, we have developed an apartment condo type team that we're going out reviewing all the condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| to make it equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| And, you know, here again, we have to go beyond get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| let's get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Will we get it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Absolutely we'll get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| I've got a good man back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| We've got him accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| We're going on the 30-month, two-and-a-half-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Then review all the values, 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| There's a great deal of fluctuation in this market right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| Fenbar raised a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| You know, you only look at it once every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Well, it actually goes beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| You have to have the good computer system and getting them trained now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| I will wind up with whatever you all decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| My preference is the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| If we wind up with one, we'll do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| There's no guarantee that I can get that one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| So I have to have a little flexibility in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| the $80,000 might be $150,000 and $130,000 if we have to go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| We need numbers in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| My preference is the one individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| and the two people for intervention management to help pull all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:36| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Phil, as you know, I'm fairly frustrated with this as well, as I'm sure you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| You actually make a very good case for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I do agree with Amy and will second her substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| As I said to you at the Intergovernmental Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| somehow we've got to find more efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| That's all there is to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Every business in the country does that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Every other department in the county faces a similar situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| and could make a similar argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| The schools certainly have and will continue to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| The health department, the library, the sheriff's department, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| And this is really a sticky wicket, to put it mildly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| We're going to face this repeatedly for the next six months until we can figure out the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| What I'd like to do is go with something now and then in the budget process try to work this thing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| because we're going to have this all across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Well, you know, I recognize a political bullet just as well as anybody sitting up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| You know, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| And that's what's sort of been laid in your lap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| But, you know, I'm the one up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| If I didn't believe in it, the safety, you know, we want to hide from the word politicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| You know, you're commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| You'd rather hear commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Before we were commissioners, then, you know, we were politicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| And this is sort of a political bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| And I recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| I'm the one that's going to get hit before it fails or whatnot for bringing something like this forward today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| But I'm going to call you back to when this came up in July and a little bit about the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| When I took office in September, the budget was in place, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| I had no input into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Several things was taken out of that budget that I don't really agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| Let's talk about cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| There's two cars in that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| We reduced to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Now they're reduced to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| And for a fleet of 17 cars, it was a $2,000 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| Now, when you have a real need, if you work with the county, and this is where you have a problem here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| when you work with the county and you take out two cars for two years and they're charged at $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| well, that's $50,000, that's $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| And if I come back in here at the budget time and ask for two cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| then I'm going to be accused of raising the budget because it's been taken out and it no longer exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| Now, at the time of this budget and working with everybody, I was giving a figure of two, three, five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| or whatever John says it is back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| And I was told to work within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Before commission, I wasn't satisfied with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| The administration on that day, and you all asked me to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| I thought this should have been argued then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| And it wouldn't be argued today when there might have been funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| So I've had very little input in my budget or the chance to explain our needs or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| And this should be no surprise that I was here because I was asked to be back here in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:40| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| I think, Dr. Field, you answered my question before I asked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| This is $100,000 looking at between now and the end of this physical year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| And how firm is that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| Is that number $120,000 or could it be $80,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| It could be $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| It really just depends on we're not just saying that these numbers, we're looking at the high end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3425)|
| 0:57:14| but we know it's going to take a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| As you look in the additional information that Paul has asked, there's nothing unreasonable about these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| These numbers are well in line with the positions that we're seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| So I would view it that if something were to happen and this got pushed off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| if one of these hires was pushed off a month just because of the problems with making the hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| or another one may not have been for a couple of months, then this number could be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| It could be much less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| And you're also saying that it's probably not going to go over $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| I wouldn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| That would be about it if they start at February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| I tend to agree with you that I think this is a position that we find ourselves facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| that we need to get on with it and not wait the four months until the next physical budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| to get on with getting these people in place because we're looking at having the computer system sometime out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Phil, I've been to your office on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| We've had many discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| What has sold me about this is I'm convinced that these people will make us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| I believe that investing in these people is going to make Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| And when you told me, for example, that your office had found parcels that went on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| that's something that I think that we should all, you know, thank you and applaud you for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| the fact that you all have taken the initiative to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| But I guess my question is, is how will these people make Knox County money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| In other words, if you have these people on staff, we understand the training, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| But the final product, what are these folks going to do to help Knox County in terms of with these appraisals and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| to bring in the dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Well, you know, being revenue neutral, then you make your money on new growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| But it is the tracking process, the supervision that they lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| There's a distortion in that the training is basically being one-on-one with whoever they're partners with for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:23| There's a distinction such as what's the difference between a one-story, a story-and-a-half house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| There's different views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| You know, we're not only going to do state training, we're going to do in-house training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| And when we get that, it's going to be more fair and more applicable to the people across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| We do know that we have pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| You know, you don't want to hear this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| but we have pockets that the property's probably not been looked at in anywhere from four to eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| And just like the simple thing of doing the tracking program that we did, we knew the permits was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| For my 30 years, the last 17 as operation manager was bringing the number back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| It just didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| Then when we got Jim on board, I put him in charge of it, and we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| We turned over a million three, as it turns out, to the county and to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| and stopped a million dollar leak, which I firmly believe simply because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| And I think we have a big gap in personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| We know that we have businesses on the real property rows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| and we don't have them on the personal property rows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| And right now, when you're just maxed out with your people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| then with these additional peoples, we can go in, just like me and Jim did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| and look in personal properties, other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| You know, you have real property, tangible property, and the other situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| So this bad and that level of management, we're going to be able to branch out now that we're away from the reappraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| and go in and fix these other little problems that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| So we will discover new, for sure, in personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| We will continue to do that in real property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| It's very hard to see what's going on every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| There's a lot that we're working with, with IT and Keith Stump over in KGAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:13| He can write us a program based on permits that finds every new swimming pool out here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| He can write us a program that will find every new addition in Knox County based on the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:30| Now, you've got the outlaws that's not going to permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| That's where the ice goes back into the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| So, but we've got to take that to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| We've got people that's on the road out here and nobody to take this information to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| Also, maybe that you don't realize is that we're looking at complaints every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| We're going out every day looking at two or three or four parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| And one thing before we think that we can't do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| one thing that I want you all to really get a scope of of how this was handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| There's 16,000 informal appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| I think, Mike, you agreed with me, Stokely Center holds about 12,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| when we used to go see Bernie and Ernie play basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| Now, I want you to take these 17 people and you all got a few phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| and imagine per person 770 people sit in front of them and complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:22| That would fill Stokely Center and some in a period of about 28 working days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| They did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| They worked until the job was over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| We give them opportunities that's never been given before to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| It was out at Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| It was out at Easttown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| This is an enormous accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| It's not been noted very much, but 770 people faced those people, your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:53| And we handled them with pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| Out of that, there's 11,000 changes, $130 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| During the formal appeal, 45 more people came into appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| Overall, it was $170 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| That's only 1.2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| That's not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| But we heard the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| We listened to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| And we're going to continue to do things that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| We've got a lot of interventions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| Part of this mass appraisal is not real estate appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| And their educational component we're going to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| These people that we're bringing in on the computer are going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| I've talked to Mark Harmon, maybe not on YouTube,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| but we're thinking about it through the library system some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| So we've got a lot of things on our plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| We don't need less staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| We need more staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| You know, I'm a physical conservative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| and I would love to support this substitute motion so I could go home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| and say that I helped cut a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| I'd be proud to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| But I can't vote for the substitute motion in clear conscience because I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| not believe that Mr. Ballard has brought to us a wish list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| I believe he has brought to us a need list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| And what I also don't want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I don't want to send the message to the other Knox County departments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| whatever you need, triple it, quadruple it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| when you ask for it because commission wants to cut you down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| I think that he's brought us an honest proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| I think he has honestly stated what his bare minimum needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| I know that there were definite problems in my district with the property appraisals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| and I believe that was not because of the work his staff did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| or the work that Mr. Ballard did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| I believe it was because they didn't have the proper tools to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| and they didn't have enough people to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| And I believe that most of those has been corrected due to significant hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| that they worked during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| And I believe he's come to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| if you don't want the problems that we had last time, this is what I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| And I believe he has stated just what he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| If I thought there was some fat in this budget, I'd sure want to cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| I love to do stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| But I'm going to support the original motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| and I am not going to support the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| because I believe that this man has just asked for his bare needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| And I believe that the best way we can serve our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| because that was the biggest problem I've had since I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| was the last property appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| I had more complaints then than the rest of my time on commission put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| And serving the needs of my constituents, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| is allowing this man the resources that he needs to do the appraisals right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Commissioner Borales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Yeah, I think, Phil, I hope I've made it clear to you that I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| and that these are things that you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| but that there are lots of other departments who also have lots of needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| and I wish I could give you everything you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| I wish I could give every department everything that it needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| But when the money's not there, it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| And I hope that we can do much better for you in this next budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| because I think that you maybe have not been treated maybe quite as fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:22| as you should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| I want to make sure that you get everything that you need in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| So I hope that this next budget cycle, things will look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| And I struggle with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| Where do you spend money and where do you don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| During the recession, do you spend money on advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| or do you try to save it to try to get through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| Because do you spend money to make money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| If you look around, there are very few places in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4014)|
| 1:07:02| where you can spend money to actually get money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| The property assessor's office is probably one of the few departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| or offices that by making sure that we have all properties accounted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:20| and appraised at a fair value can affect the budget on the revenue side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4040)|
| 1:07:30| And as our property assessor has said, he's the one that's standing before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| and he's the one that's going to take the bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| He feels that he needs this in order to adequately appraise all properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Believe me, because I do work in the trustee's office, I see where when people come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:56| and there have been properties that have been overlooked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| and have not been appraised yet when a house has been built on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| And it's a direct impact because they don't have enough staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4086)|
| 1:08:14| If that's what the property assessor says, I have no reason to doubt him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| He's saying that he can't get all of this done with the staff that he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| and we're missing out on revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| And, Phil, you and I talked about this over the weekend, how much revenue we have lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| and it's substantially more than what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| Could you go into that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| Well, if you just go to the tracking program on the permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| if it stands where it is, the lean years was in 07 and 08 with 6,500 and 4,500 sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| Permits includes everything from three steps to pools and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| In the boom years of 05 and 06, which they were boom years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| then if I gather in 08, a million two, a million three to put back into the county budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4138)|
| 1:09:06| then you would have to think with this program going on that it has to be between three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| and five million dollars if it was tracked the same way which it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| In other words, by spending a little bit of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| we could multiply that over by getting in more revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| Is that the understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| That's why I've understood that this is your argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| that you feel that you need this to adequately assess every property in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| so that Knox County is getting what it is fairly justified in collecting in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:40| Well, my heart bleeds just a little bit more than raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| No, we're not raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| We're raising revenue because if you've got a lot out there and someone's built a house on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| and they're receiving a tax bill for the lot only and not the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| then they're not paying their fair share of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| One of the teams that did that, and they'll all average a little something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| but one team had 900 permits the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| And you have to go back and look at it before September 1st and these sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| But what happens when you're trying to run the gauntlet and get all the properties looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| which this year was started in October and went at the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| You know, I extended that two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| and probably gathered another 30,000 pieces of data, which sort of helped make it more equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| But you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| But now that we have found it, that $40 million, on a full assessment the following year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| turns into $57 million of new revenue, which in the reappraisal year we only had $177 million to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4238)|
| 1:10:47| So we've already found $57 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| We picked up $1.3 million, but $57 million, that will be added to the tax roll next year before we even start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| And you feel you need these in order to make sure that nothing else falls between the cracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4257)|
| 1:11:04| Well, I think we need more people, but there's a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| You cannot bring people in and train and get a new computer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| This will stop this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| We'll know more about it in a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| Commissioner Fonda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| Phil, I trust what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| I do want to ask our finance director, if he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Where are we going to get the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| I guess we discussed this a little bit in the Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| and it would be my assumption from the undesignated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| That question is going to come up again, I suspect, because there are other departments, as I indicated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| that have worked great efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| And they have the same request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| They've talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| I'm sure they've talked to other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| This is a real conundrum because I agree with the comments made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| I know this is somewhere that you put your money and you get your money back in some multiple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| But given the situation we find ourselves in, the economy and every other business, I'm really troubled by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| Thank you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| John, could you ask a quick question for me again before I kind of get into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| So you say fund balance, but that's just for that money this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| How, going forward, how are those positions going to be funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| Are we going to have a constant hook into the fund balance to get the ongoing salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4359)|
| 1:12:47| From here until June 30th, it would be from the fund balance, and it's making an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| And then it would be up to what you consider, you know, Phil's case is how soon will he add properties to the tax roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| and for how much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| And so that's something that we'll have to work through through this budget process and say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| what additions have we seen on the tax roll, how much are they worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| and how much is that going to bring in as we discuss the new budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| So right now it's pretty much an unfunded mandate that if we pass, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| Well, yeah, you're talking about future revenues, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| So, you know, I struggle with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| I'm sure all commissioners have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| So, you know, this stands to be pretty much a million-dollar day pretty much for property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:39| With that said, I understand the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| I fully understand the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| You know, when you're talking about a system that is 80s vintage, I guess you said in the earlier meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| I mean, that's kind of a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| However, you know, we're talking about looks like $800,000 that we're putting into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| And I fully support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| You know, I am, as Commissioner Saunders stated, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| there's a lot of efficiencies that can be pulled out of a system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| especially one that hadn't been updated, you know, since 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| There should be some immediate benefits from updating those processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| I'm going to support this, the second piece as well, to the original motion, not the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:31| You know, pretty much because I trust you and your judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| And I know that's heavy, you know, things to place on your shoulders, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| I'm going to trust but verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| I really want to hear back, you know, maybe three or four months into next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:52| And hopefully you'll be able to tell us a good story in terms of how things are operating better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4492)|
| 1:15:00| You know, I know that I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| I do remember, I don't know who asked you to come back in January, but however that process worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| you said, well, we'll come back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| And I think you've done your homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| I think you've been in this position long enough to have seen what the problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| So, again, I'm going to trust you, but I'd ask that you kind of come back to us with a good story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| I want to heavily put that on, backing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| Well, you know, I didn't come here today and stand before you, and if I got it, didn't expect great expectations, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| One thing that makes it a little easier, what we did in personal property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| we cut back $400,000 to $310,000 on one contract we have, which is $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:45| And what we did is we upped the personal property from $50,000 to $100,000, and we'll do audits on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| Now, that was one little component that I had hoped to negotiate in June, but that has escaped and gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4551)|
| 1:16:00| And I only mention that in passing if that helps anybody with any hiccups up there at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| Phil, you know I talk about this pretty strong at the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| You know how I'm conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| You served with me here a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| But I ask for the information you give it to me, and I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| And the reason why is with all these charts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| and everything you've shown that we're doing this about $18 less per partial than Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4586)|
| 1:16:34| Our employees up there are handling about 12 to 15 percent more partials than they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| It's just everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| We're doing more with less than these other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| But Commissioner Lutho asked a question there a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Do you spend money to make money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| If you've ever been in business, that's the secret to making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| If you can make money, you want to spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| Any time you make a profit, of course, we're not up here to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| We want to be fair and try to give the services we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| But you don't go broke making a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| I'm going to vote for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| We have a substitute motion on the floor to just hire one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| Everyone clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| How many ayes were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Two ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Three ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| We'll go back to the original motion of hiring three, which is written in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| We're getting ready to go into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| Can we take a break, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| Ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| Five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| That means it's just ten instead of 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=4686)|

| 1:36:22| Commissioner Luthell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| It's come to my attention that my nephew, Aaron Gray, is the engineer for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:37| I didn't realize that until he walked in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| And because of that, I am going to have to recuse myself from the vote and from discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:49| And I asked the law director if that were the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| And, Mr. Law Director, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| I commend you for doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| And that's precisely what you should do is recuse yourself both from the vote and from any discussion leading thereto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| So I'm going to feel just mark that down for me, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:18| You want to go first, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| Mr. Huber is going to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| I'm going to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| And there are at least three people from the area who are residents out there who indicated that they want to speak in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:36| And I would like for them also to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| But Mr. Huber will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| Well, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| If I'm going to let MPC go first, give the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| Mr. Chair, members of commission, you have before you two requests as read by the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:54| requests for a sector plan amendment from, let me grab that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5874)|
| 1:38:02| from low-density residential to neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| and a rezoning request from agricultural to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| The size of the property under this consideration, again, is approximately 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| It's located at the intersection of South North Shore Drive and Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| This is a location of property that is in part of Knox County, southwest Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:29| that has seen steady growth over the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| primarily in the form of low-density single-family residential subdivisions, Montgomery Cove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:42| Jefferson Park are two of the several subdivisions that have developed over the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| The applicant in looking at and requesting, we had several conversations before he made application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:56| and he looked at requesting the neighborhood commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| You're in a part of the county where you've had, as I say, some strong, steady residential growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:11| You have a location that is the intersection of a minor arterial street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| and a minor collector street based on the major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| You're in a part of the county where if you want immediate, everyday commercial services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| you don't have many options or choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| Part of what we have been looking at as a planning staff over the past several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| and more recently is the fact of trying to encourage and create urban patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| and suburban patterns, development patterns, where you try to cut down as much as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:48| having to travel to get everyday commercial needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| In other words, trying to reduce dependence upon the automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| And if you read any kind of planning literature, this is almost front and center in terms of we should be getting away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=5996)|
| 1:40:05| from patterns that do require use of the automobile for a lot of what we do on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6005)|
| 1:40:13| The neighborhood commercial designation and the concurrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| or the companion zone neighborhood commercial are meant for situations such as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| where you have a location that is the location, a major road location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| You're in the middle of an area where you do have several subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| and neighborhoods that are developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| You have an opportunity using a pretty restrictive commercial zone to establish a pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:43| that makes sense from a lot of standpoints in terms of being able to provide those everyday commercial services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| where in some cases it may be over time, if we can get connections, it may be that you can walk to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:58| But the idea here is to cut down on cars having to travel on North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| or up north directly toward Kingston Pike through Farragut of having to travel long distances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| keeping those cars off the road where they have to go those distances for everyday commercial needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| The neighborhood commercial zone is, as I say, that kind of zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| Now, in the staff recommendation for this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| the staff not only recommended the plan amendment to neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| but we also recommended in addition to recommending the neighborhood commercial zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| we recommended that designation with three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| The conditions being to limit the uses that are limited, that are listed in the neighborhood commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| further limit those uses to those uses that have low impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| The second is to require lighting considerations for the uses that will be on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6111)|
| 1:41:59| and also to look at the kinds of design that might be appropriate for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:09| In addition to the three staff conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| the planning commission went further in strengthening at least two of those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| in terms of the requirements for outdoor lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| and also the requirements as they related to the actual design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| and layout of any development on that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| but also to require as a fourth condition any proposed development coming in under that neighborhood commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:41| at that location would require a development plan under use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| At the same time with each submission of that, a concept plan for the entire site would be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| that would not be subject to review or approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| but would allow the commission to see how each particular development is fitting in to an overall plan for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6178)|
| 1:43:07| You have about 12 acres to that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| Not all of it in reality will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| The applicant may want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| But in looking at, again, getting back to what has taken place in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| you've had over 1,000 since, let me go to the direct numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:30| since the year 2000 within two miles of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| we estimate you've had over 1,300 building permits issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| In addition to that, and there may be some overlap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| within roughly three-quarters of a mile of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| you've had three subdivisions where you've had almost 600 lots that have been platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| So this is an area that, as I mentioned before, is experiencing growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| And if you look at how to develop an urban pattern or a suburban pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| where it's an efficient, effective pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| you need to look at where can you reasonably assume that you're going to have basic commercial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| We're not talking about regional commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| We're not even talking about community commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| We're talking about neighborhood commercial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| So you have the growth that's taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| You have, now granted, North Shore, and it's been noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| And when the plan comes in, there will be a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| In fact, that's under review right now by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| You'll have to have improvements made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| and there looks like there's the possibility that the applicant will be able to work with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| to help make some of those improvements to North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| As I say, you have a site plan for one of the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| You have the overall concept plan that will be on NPC's agenda for the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| It was postponed from the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| So the commission will still be looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| And as I say, one of the things they'll be looking at with each particular development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| is the requirement for a development plan as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:17| That was a condition required by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Those were four pretty tough, if you don't mind me saying, pretty tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| and very clear conditions that any applicant, any developer has to make on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:33| There have been, I believe, at least two other occasions, even in the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| where the staff has always, this is not like this is a new concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| The staff has always envisioned this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| or seen the possibility for a neighborhood commercial center at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| So, you know, this has been an ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| It hasn't been included in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| But staff has felt very strongly that this site should still be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| be out there for discussion as a neighborhood center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:12| We've talked about the development, the change in trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| the development in the area, the fact we think this is a logical site for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| I might point out that in the sector plan, the Southwest County sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| I believe it's the very last section, very last page of the sector plan, appendix B, entitled Shoto Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:32| That section laid out in very general terms the fact that at some point we're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| or we should be looking at a range of services, neighborhood oriented primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:48| that can serve this area as the development pattern continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| Because if you don't, then you will have a situation, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| where the primary ability to get to places, to move long distances over what can be very heavily traveled roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6416)|
| 1:47:05| is going to be the use of the automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| And we need to begin doing things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| looking at ways where we can diminish our reliance on the automobile and looking at shorter trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6432)|
| 1:47:19| hopefully at some point in the future, maybe even by pedestrian travel, of getting to these particular sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:26| I'd be glad to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| It's a very, hopefully you've been able to look at and read the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| It's a very thorough staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| It points out the issues, especially related to why we need to amend the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| as well as the rationale for changing the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| So I'd be glad to answer questions now or after the presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:50| But, again, the Planning Commission recommending approval of neighborhood commercial for the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6470)|
| 1:48:00| and see in neighborhood zoning with four conditions on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:08| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| One of the questions that I know a lot of the citizens have come to me about is the size of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| as far as the neighborhood commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| I think it's 12 acres plus three others that's under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| What is the history in the county on rezoning neighborhood commercial parcels that size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:30| Is this an exceptionally large size for neighborhood commercial or do we have precedent in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6510)|
| 1:48:39| That's a question I'm not prepared to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| I don't think this may be the largest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| but I don't think that there's an appreciable difference in other neighborhood commercials that we've rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| I could be wrong, but I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| I'm not prepared to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| I would have been better off if I had been able to look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| But we've had, I don't know, maybe a half a dozen to ten rezoning neighborhood commercials since the zone was established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6541)|
| 1:49:14| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| I can't answer that question directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| One other question I had is that so many of these other developments that we've looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| and some of these have been residential developments, we've had difficulties with storm water management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| Does the topography, the soil types, et cetera, out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| is there a potential for there actually being harm caused to any of the neighbors as a result of the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:40| Are there any particular storm water management issues that we need to be aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:47| One of the parts of the process that has been already ongoing is looking at the storm water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| looking at the drainage plans that have been produced so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| There's one stream that flows through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6597)|
| 1:50:06| affects what you're rezoning tonight and also will affect a companion rezoning that will be coming up in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:13| So the county staff has been taking a close look at any impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| And, of course, any, as with regard to any plan that is reviewed by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| and that has to go through Knox County Engineering, especially their storm water staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| it's going to be looked at relative to all the regulations that apply to making sure that a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:36| that takes place on this site is going to take place with minimal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6636)|
| 1:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| I have one other question, and I may need to direct this to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| I noticed that one of these is an amendment to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| I thought through one of the, I think it was the chancellor's court rulings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| is that we weren't going to do those anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| There were some legal challenges to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| Are we back doing sector plan change approvals now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| State law was amended about, it's been about two years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| where the planning commission is still identified with making sector plan changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6664)|
| 1:51:13| but they can forward that on to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| And in order for a sector plan change to be effective, you have to approve the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:24| You said that the MPC can forward it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| Well, no, they do forward it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| It has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| It has to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| Let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| You're the ultimate determinative authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| We talked about traffic for a moment in terms of the traffic in the area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| It's my understanding that we're looking at different sites for an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| which could or could not be located in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| But how is traffic addressed at the MPC level and with the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6713)|
| 1:52:00| And also any improvements that may need to be made should this be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| Well, one of the key pieces that is in process of being reviewed now, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| we got it late for it to be considered with the site plan that has been submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| so that site plan was postponed to our February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| But one of the key pieces is a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| I can't speak to the particulars of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| but that's going to be looked at closely here between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| and when we make our recommendation for the February MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| This is the kind of development that requires a level of traffic impact study to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| It's already been pointed out that, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| we recognized this when we did the staff report, that there is traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| and that intersection has some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| So that's not something that we've, you know, have ignored or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| it's out there and we made note of that in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| But that is something that can begin to be alleviated with the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| that come out of that traffic impact study as it relates to the development of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| Bruce Wheatry, could I ask you to come down to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| I believe that you've had some conversation with regards to the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| perhaps needing to realign the roadway, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| So could you give us a briefing on traffic in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| and what you see should this be approved, what would need to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| We have reviewed the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| As late as Friday, we've been working on the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| It would probably be easiest if I break it into two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| If you're dealing with just the Weigels site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| let's say 50% of the site developed as being proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| You are looking at the very minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| You're looking at turn lanes on North Shore Drive to get into the Weigels site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| You're also looking at having to do a vertical curve cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| which what I mean by that is you're going to have to remove a hump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| out of North Shore Drive right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| That hump provides, is essentially causing a site distance problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| at the intersection of Choteau and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| Additionally, if you develop the property anywhere beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| then clearly the intersection at Choteau and North Shore will have to be improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| to the extent of at the very minimum it will either have to be a roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| or a signalized intersection with additional turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| Now, we have not gotten far enough to really get into the detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| as to how big of an improvement this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| We haven't gotten into determining what the taper lengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| and turn lane lengths for that intersection would have to be if it was signalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| But that's essentially where we are with the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| Who's going to pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| Do we know how much it's going to be approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| We recognized even before this development came in the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| regarding the hump on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| The developer has agreed to cut that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| and Knox County will come back in and resurface that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| We'd already anticipated having to shoulder that entire burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| Setting this development aside, that was something we felt like needed to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| for this intersection regardless of what happens today or in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| That needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Now, I cannot tell you at this point what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| as far as the full-blown intersection improvement at North Shore and Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| I can't tell you exactly who would pay for that at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| I can tell you that Knox County does not have all the money in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| to do that improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| With regards to, you mentioned turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| and you also mentioned a possible roundabout, possible signalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| What is the traffic count in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| I can't tell you off the top of my head what the actual volume count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| But what that intersection came to our attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| not so much as far as the volume was concerned, but the number of accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| That's why I'm looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| The first thing we thought needed to be done is to have that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| that hump removed out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| just due to the number of accidents that have taken place on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| From a congestion standpoint, as it stands right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| it's probably only in about the top four or five intersections in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| as it relates to congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| And what about the number of accidents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| You said it got your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| What is that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| I believe it's around 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| Per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| That's over about a three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| What we do is we take that and compare it to other intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| So it's kind of a comparison against other intersections is how it gets rated out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| Yes, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| This whole parcel, those three conditions will still apply to the whole parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=6996)|
| 1:56:40| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| Four conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Four, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| I thought you said three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| I've seen it said four here, but I thought you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| In all reality, when you hold this down to neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| that's not going to bring neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| that's not going to bring many people out of the other neighborhoods into it, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:58| The kind of businesses that are there, what I'm talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| are not going to draw people from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| No, sir, that's not the intent of the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| It wasn't crafted as that kind of zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| That's the way I understood it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| In all reality, it would keep these people from having to go into other people's neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| You know, the zone itself, the criteria within the zone really doesn't allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| would not allow, for instance, big box retailers to come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| It would not allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| I mean, it's strictly small scale, neighborhood level, neighborhood intensive type uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7044)|
| 1:57:35| That's sort of like South Knoxville over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| We don't have a lot of development over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| And everybody tells me, well, we don't want to be like West Knoxville with all that crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| Well, if we didn't have to go down there and trade, West Knoxville wouldn't have that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| So we're creating a problem for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| I just wanted to be sure that I understood you right about the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| Hubert, you wanted to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| One quick question for Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Buzz, about less than a mile, maybe half a mile back to the northeast is open the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:12| Davis Family Y, maybe familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| That's a pretty big facility, not 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| But did that require any rezoning or anything like we're doing this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| It was part of the overall development for Jefferson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| Well, it was reviewed separately, but it was within the confines of what has become Jefferson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7107)|
| 1:58:34| It was separated as a separate piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| But that required use on review approval by NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| And rezoning, because I think that property was zoned agricultural before it was rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| to allow the Jefferson Park development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| So it went from agriculture to single family to what would the Y be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:56| The plan residential is a zone that allows the consideration of certain non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7136)|
| 1:59:04| And that would be one of the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Two real quick comments, because I think this will probably be brought up as we go through this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:15| One is around the corner from there, there's a little, it's not a minute mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| but it's a place that does have gas and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| And I don't know how that figures into your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| That's one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| And then the second question I have is when you put a development in of this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| what impact does that actually have on traffic and traffic flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| Is it, you know, does it increase it a lot, a little bit, or minimal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:43| I guess I don't have a good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| I know many people have contacted me concerned about increased traffic, if you put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7185)|
| 1:59:51| How much of an impact does a development that size have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| I don't know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| Let me answer the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| I believe you're talking the small commercial development up there toward the railroad, right on the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7197)|
| 2:00:03| That was another, that's commercial development that was allowable as a use and review under the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7203)|
| 2:00:12| But the difference in that and what you have here is that is a very, very small scale commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7212)|
| 2:00:22| that is intended to try to be developed as part of an overall development plan for one development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7222)|
| 2:00:29| Now, it could serve surrounding areas, but in that case, that is very small scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7229)|
| 2:00:37| and it's really not comparable to what we're looking at here today in terms of a neighborhood commercial center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:44| Now, the second question, I can't give you exact impact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| You know, let's face it, you're going to have traffic that will be coming to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| The idea is to keep that traffic local so that it's not having to add to other, you know, traffic routes going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7254)|
| 2:01:05| The North Shore traffic is what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| North Shore traffic, trying to keep that traffic internal rather than having to go out of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7267)|
| 2:01:13| and that way you have a negative impact on the overall regional transportation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:22| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| Mr. Huber, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7285)|
| 2:01:39| John Huber, 12248 Mossy Point Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, Bayou Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| Tonight we're here to ask for your approval of a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| and a rezoning request neighborhood commercial for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| Number one, your professional planning staff has thoroughly reviewed the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| and recommended full approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| Number two, the same area was reviewed five years ago, and the conclusion was the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| Number three, Metropolitan Planning Commission unanimously voted to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| And number four, the approval will allow us to create a sustainable development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| to service the needs of thousands of homeowners who must currently drive many miles round trip for basic needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:16| As a resident of the Choteau area, I'm keenly aware of the sensitivity of the residents who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| Out of respect and in an effort to create an open dialogue with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| I contacted as many people as possible through e-mails, you know, just letters, flyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7344)|
| 2:02:31| and invited them to two public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| We actually had these meetings prior to even when the rezoning signs were placed out to notify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7352)|
| 2:02:40| Since then, I've had three more public meetings for a total of five meetings open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7360)|
| 2:02:46| and I still continue to meet with everyone even as late as last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| Through these meetings, we received a lot of valuable feedback from the residents, staff, and MPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| We've been able to incorporate a lot of these ideas and concerns into our design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| This is our new concept plan right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| We changed locations of buildings, changed locations of storm water, agreed to heavier lighting restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7381)|
| 2:03:08| trying to lean towards dark sky compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| You know, unfortunately, by proceeding with this open process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| we've also been labeled with misinformation by a small and vocal group that are opposed to any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| Additionally, we've had the opportunity to meet many in favor of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:25| This is evidenced by the numerous e-mails and phone calls you guys have received, and some of them are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:31| My experience is that there are many more in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| They're just silent right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| That's what happened out in Covered Bridge and Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| When we came into Hardin Valley, there was a lot of folks that were scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| We worked through the process with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| And I can assure you now I can walk down the street and look every one of them in the eye and shake their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| They love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| They love us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| Through negotiations with MPC, when you talk about the folks that are in support that are silent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7431)|
| 2:03:59| I think somebody brought up the Davis Family YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| I think it's a perfect example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| They've only been open for three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| It was a hot button going out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| They've only been open for three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| And right now, they have already exceeded their enrollment goal for the end of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:15| Their goal was 1,250 people to be enrolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| Right now, there are over 1,400 people, and they've only been open three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| They're already talking about expanding the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| So the people are there to support this type of product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| Through negotiations, as we've mentioned over here, MPC, on our proposed acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| it will actually only end up being about six acres of true retail use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| I know it sounds like a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| We're talking about 12 or 15, but it's really only going to come down to about six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| We've got a lot of extra things that we've got to put up with, we've got to not put up with, pardon me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| that we will do that we will end up coming back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| Everything has got to be a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| Every single thing that we bring has to be a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| And the lighting package, we've also got to use residential materials in everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| I can assure you that neighborhood commercial, with these additional restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| will be among the most restricted commercial development in Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| I'll yield the rest of my time to Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7515)|
| 2:05:22| I'm really not sure how much time is left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| John King, P.O. Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| You have a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| I know there are at least three speakers, residents of the area, who want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| I, for one, when you get somebody on a proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| and somebody says I want to come speak in support of it and they live out there, I want to let you all hear them for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| There are people here who are in support who don't necessarily want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| And if I can, since some of them may be seated, some of them may be standing, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:58| but the easiest thing to do for those of you who are here in support, would you just raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| I've heard as concerns or questions about the project issues related to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7571)|
| 2:06:19| You've already heard Mr. Weitrick and Buzz and, to some extent, Mr. Huber discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| Certainly, there will be some additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| It is essentially, the way I would describe it, a big portion of it will be redirected traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:38| It will be redirected more toward this as opposed to going out of this area somewhere else to get these particular types of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:48| There's going to be some required road work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| I'm glad to hear Bruce talk about it like we did down in West Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| and like I grew up talking about taking a hump out of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| Engineers call it a vertical curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| And we're committed to participation with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| We have been in contact with the county engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| We remain in contact with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| And we'll continue to do so throughout the development of this entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| And that's not just because we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| If we didn't, we'd still have to because everything that is done on this piece of ground has already been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7644)|
| 2:07:30| is subject to another approval process going through Metropolitan Planning Commission, use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7650)|
| 2:07:38| another, if you will, bite of this same apple, another opportunity for public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| another opportunity for people to, well, let's don't do it quite that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| Let's do it a little different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| It's still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| The size of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7673)|
| 2:08:05| This hatched area is what he referred to as an even more restricted permissible use in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7685)|
| 2:08:19| This is a detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| This is a detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| That's a couple of acres that comes out of this property right there that can't be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7704)|
| 2:08:31| This is the potential place along that blue line stream that cannot be disturbed or built upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7711)|
| 2:08:41| It's probably another couple of acres or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| There's an existing utility facility right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| You look at it, and what you see is if you take what is shown on here as a current concept plan in relation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:58| something that's coming up in MTC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| If you went across here, the middle of that parking lot, everything that's there where all the development is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7741)|
| 2:09:08| slightly less than six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| Now, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| We'll get three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| Well, maybe somebody will have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| I have a Bobby Acord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| Thanks, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| Are you in opposition or you for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| Opposition, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| May I use your thing up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| We have, Mr. Chairman, we have about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| I need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| I'm Bobby Acord, and I live at 12500 Choteau Mill Lane, which is Choteau Mill subdivision adjacent to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| We have about 20 folks that would like to speak, but they're all deferring and giving their time to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| You'll get five minutes or maybe six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| Mr. Chairman, I first found out about this project in my front yard one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| A gentleman came by and gave me a flyer and told me what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| I started laughing out loud because I thought it was the most absurd thing I'd ever heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| But yet the more I got involved, the more I realized that they really want to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| and then the MPC let it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| And now here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| I've met with many of you prior to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| One of the major issues that's been raised by several of you has to do with what is really in front of this body this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:42| In December at the MPC meeting, there was a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| as well as a neighborhood commercial rezoning allowed based upon the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7847)|
| 2:10:55| concept plan that you see in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| Mr. Huber, as he stated, went to all the neighborhoods and showed everybody this concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| And, in fact, on a meeting on Thursday night, December 3rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| that was the plan he was purporting to present to the MPC, which they acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| We found out the next morning that that plan had changed significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| because they moved the Weigels off the corner and actually moved it up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7876)|
| 2:11:23| Then we found out by looking at the Weigels use on review package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| the new improved site plan had been submitted to the MPC without telling the MPC this at the December meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7887)|
| 2:11:36| and it doubled the amount of square footage on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| This total project is now 15 1⁄2 acres and 40,000 square feet in a neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7901)|
| 2:11:49| Now, the concern that many of you have expressed to us is that why isn't this entire package in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| to be determined this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| And that's because it's being submitted to the MPC piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| I'm going to read a paragraph out of the MPC staff report that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| the applicant will attempt to make arrangements that the entire 15.4 acres be considered at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:12| by Knox County Commission at their January 25th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| barring any postponements at MPC's December or January meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| Well, there has been a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| Now the entire project is not in front of you, and many of you expressed concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:27| and I agree that you should act on this matter as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| Now, there are some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| The traffic impact study should have been required for the MPC's first action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| It was not, even though it had been ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| And because the traffic impact study is critical to this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| we think it should be considered by this body at the end of February as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| And last but not least is the Board of Education decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| I have seen the traffic impact study, and I know what the requirements and recommendations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| Besides lowering the vertical curve, as Mr. King said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| they're only going to require a four-way stop at this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| And I'd like to supplement what Mr. Weitrich said about the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| and relates to your question about crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| I spoke to Mike on the MPC staff, and he gave me the data that they considered from May 5th to May 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=7995)|
| 2:13:23| This is the fifth most dangerous intersection in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| There have been 20 crashes at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| including 12 what they call angle crashes that all of you would know as a T-bone crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| There have been nine crashes that include injury out of those 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| This is a very dangerous intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| and our concern is that the MPC approved this project without looking at the traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| and now this body is about to approve this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| with the possibility that the elementary school is going to go right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| That decision by the Board of Education is due to come out within a few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| if not before the February meeting of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| One of Mr. Huber's associates has represented to one of the neighbors that it's a done deal, as he called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8045)|
| 2:14:11| and that Choteau site number three, which is at the end of Choteau Mill, is the approved site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:17| But then he spoke to another gentleman in the same neighborhood today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| and said no, it's going to go out at Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| This is probably one of the closest guarded secrets in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| but the fact of the matter is if the Choteau site number three is chosen by the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| then the traffic impact study in front of the MPC is completely worthless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| because there's no way a thousand students and the bus traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| is going to be able to go through a four-way stop at Choteau and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| For those reasons, we think the commission should wait until the MPC acts on the three-and-a-half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8085)|
| 2:14:52| It should wait until the MPC considers the use-on-review proposal by Weigels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| and let's see what the Board of Education decides as it relates to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8097)|
| 2:15:01| because that's going to have a definite impact on the requirements of this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| as it relates to the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| Now, I've probably spent five minutes talking about reasons to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| This, with all due respect, is a very complicated issue to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| It's not particular and peculiar just to our development and our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| He was asked, what about other commercial neighborhood zonings within the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8123)|
| 2:15:28| I can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| We spoke to the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| We have looked at every single county commission meeting since March 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| when the ordinance was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| We called county commissioners that were on the commission at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| There has not been a parcel larger than two acres developed neighborhood commercial in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8143)|
| 2:15:50| since the adoption of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| This blows it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| By going to over 15 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| you folks have the potential of establishing a very dangerous precedent for our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| because you're not going to be able to tell the next developer that 15 acres is too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8162)|
| 2:16:07| You're going to have to be able to say yes, regardless, because of the precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| And if I may just add one more thing concerning the size of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| The city of Knoxville, in conjunction with the MPC, has their one-year plan amendment or one-year update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8176)|
| 2:16:23| Some of you guys may be familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| Now, that one-year plan update is done in conjunction with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| It incorporates all of the sector plans around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| and takes into account the general plan 2033, all of the various sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| That defines neighborhood commercial zoning as being not deeper than an adjacent residential lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:47| or, in any event, 300 feet, and it must be on a corner of the two collector arterial streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:54| whatever those terms are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| And I have this here that you can see the actual city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| Mr. Baker, do you need to kind of wrap it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| I'll wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| 300 feet deep by 300 feet wide is 90,000 square feet, and that's two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:15| I believe by their actions, by the adoption of the one-year update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:21| it was never intended to have a neighborhood commercial parcel larger than two acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| and certainly not as big as 15 1⁄2 acres and 40,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8246)|
| 2:17:31| And I'd like to have the opportunity to respond if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8251)|
| 2:17:46| Mr. King, you have three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| I would like to respond to some of the comments you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| but back to those people who have indicated an interest in speaking in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8273)|
| 2:17:58| I'm going to let a few of them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| He says there's going to be a four-way stop at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:09| That's a decision that Mr. Weitrick and the Department of Engineering will make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| and I think they're looking at other alternatives for that intersection as opposed to just a four-way stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8293)|
| 2:18:22| MPC didn't act on any plan that was shown up here or this one that I showed you earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8302)|
| 2:18:36| and they won't be acting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| That was a concept plan that's just what the name implies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| Initially, there was a concept plan presented in connection with questions as to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8323)|
| 2:18:51| what could go there, what could it look like, et cetera, and there was a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| MPC approved no concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| MPC approved a sector plan amendment and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| And what they have before them now, which is this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| came as a consequence of the use on review that was submitted for a proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| and one of the conditions they put on when they rezoned it by saying any proposed development that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:21| has to come forth for use on review approval and it must be accompanied by a site development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8361)|
| 2:19:29| And once again, they won't be approving that site development plan either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| They will be considering it while they go through the approval of whatever proposed development's going to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| So, you know, I just wanted to get that straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8381)|
| 2:19:47| That hatched area that's on there hatched in red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8387)|
| 2:19:54| proposed development in that area is limited to 20 uses total, 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8394)|
| 2:20:01| In the neighborhood commercial zone, there are 55 permitted uses of property in that CN zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8401)|
| 2:20:10| They said in that area you only get to consider and will only look at for purposes of approval 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| less than half of what is otherwise permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| And of all of those proposed uses that are permissible in the CN zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:29| 44 of them were uses permitted as of right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:36| And they attached a condition that said, no, you get no development as a matter of right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8436)|
| 2:20:43| You have to come in and apply for each one of them and get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8443)|
| 2:20:48| I suggest to you that Mr. Huber is very accurate when he says that this is by far the most restrictive of uses you'll find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8448)|
| 2:20:58| Mr. King, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| On the size, I'd like for maybe Buzz can respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| But I would tell you that there is no, in the county, there is no specified maximum size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8464)|
| 2:21:13| If you want to limit it like they're talking about, the two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| what you've accomplished is the exact opposite of what many people want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| That is more of the development into the interior of the property, more landscaping, more buffered areas, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8482)|
| 2:21:29| and thus a larger site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| And 5,000 square foot buildings with space between them and green and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8491)|
| 2:21:39| and you can't get that kind of thing done in such a limited space and achieve that look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8499)|
| 2:21:46| So I'd suggest to you that what we're proposing is a good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| It is eminently restricted and protected as far as whatever is going to happen on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| and we would ask approval of the sector plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8524)|
| 2:22:05| Mr. Hager, do you want to do your three minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| If you don't mind, the monitor again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8529)|
| 2:22:15| I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| Mr. Huber, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8537)|
| 2:22:18| I'm going to let some people speak in favor and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| We've talked a lot about the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| and the most restricted and all of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| That is the proposed Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| I ask any of you to tell me what's the difference between that Weigels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| and the one on Kingston Pike at Smith Road or any other Weigels throughout the Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| except there's a split rail fence in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| There is no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| In fact, the proposed monument signed for this Weigels is 10 feet wider or wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8567)|
| 2:22:53| and the monument signed on Kingston Pike is only 6 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8573)|
| 2:22:57| Here's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| When you start talking about more restrictions, it's necessary that they live up to those restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:05| The MPC staff is prepared to approve this for the MPC meeting at the second week of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8585)|
| 2:23:12| There is no difference between that and any other Weigels in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| We also have residents here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| Some of you folks want to stand up and say whether you're against the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| Everybody with the signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| Ladies and gentlemen of the commission, we have nearly 400 petitions signed against this development, 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8607)|
| 2:23:37| And given more time, we would have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| These folks agree that they don't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| One of the major issues in this whole development, and the MPC can vouch for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| in amending the sector plan, there has to be a demonstrable market for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| You've got over 400 households who have taken the time to fax us petitions that say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8633)|
| 2:23:59| I dare say if a prospective tenant of this development knew about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8639)|
| 2:24:03| they wouldn't go in there as a tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| Now, I want to say one last thing and just leave this with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8646)|
| 2:24:15| Not everybody standing behind me is about to agree with this statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| but I'm going to tell you we're not anti-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| We're for common sense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| Here's what's common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| Adhere to what you have done in the past with respect to neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8666)|
| 2:24:31| and leave this parcel limited to two acres and allow Bill Weigel to build his development, his Bill Weigel store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:39| Let Mr. Huber, who's well-known for his residential work at Covered Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| develop the remainder of the property along the same lines as Covered Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| And I would dare say that the majority of these people standing behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8687)|
| 2:24:51| and that have sent these 400 petitions in would drop their opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| Do not let this dangerous precedent fall today to go throughout this county for future development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| and we just ask you to use some common sense in deciding whether this makes sense for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8707)|
| 2:25:16| They all applaud like I've done something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| I'm going to let a few people on both sides speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8721)|
| 2:25:29| You're in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| I'll let you go first and maybe a couple more in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8732)|
| 2:25:36| Then let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| My name is Jim McEvers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8741)|
| 2:25:42| I live at 12630 Early Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| I believe you all received an e-mail today from Deborah Van Meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| She's pretty much stated her position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8755)|
| 2:25:59| I would like to point out that it's been said that this location of this facility at this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8759)|
| 2:26:06| will alleviate a lot of traffic and will alleviate people having to go out of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8766)|
| 2:26:13| I would like to point out that within four miles or four and a half miles of that intersection is Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8773)|
| 2:26:21| with the Weigels right down the road, Smith Roads and other Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| When you come in from the other side, there's a Kroger's, the brand new Kroger development in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8786)|
| 2:26:34| There is plenty, plenty of commercial retail available right in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8794)|
| 2:26:45| Then they talk about people having to travel outside to go to these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| I would also point out that since this is a residential area, most everyone in there works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8809)|
| 2:26:57| They go by a Weigels, a Kroger's, any direction you go out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| To think that people are just going to stay home and go to this little local retail center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:11| that's being stuck at this intersection is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| People travel in and out of that area Saturday morning going shopping at Kroger's and Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| and all the other stores available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| There's banks, you name it, within at most maybe seven miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8843)|
| 2:27:31| They're already going by there to and from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8851)|
| 2:27:35| To even consider putting something like this in this location, primarily a residential intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8855)|
| 2:27:42| really kind of stretches as to why is it even needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8865)|
| 2:27:46| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8866)|
| 2:27:55| I'm Randy Wolf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| I wasn't planning to speak, but I thought I would say a little something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8877)|
| 2:28:05| Put my sign right there so you know which side I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| I've heard guys here at the MPC talking about how this project is going to keep traffic in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8890)|
| 2:28:20| Like we're zipping around out there in the streets like a pinball, bouncing around in a pinball machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| All my neighbors have said to me when they moved out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| they moved out here because they wanted to be in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| There's not any stores out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| That's really what we liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| And that's really the core of the issue, I think, for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| This project is so big and so far, in our opinion, out of scope for what the community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| It's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| But we stop and we get our supplies on the way home from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8923)|
| 2:28:48| We get stuff for the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| We're not out here zipping up and down the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| Maybe you should have come and asked us, but that's not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8932)|
| 2:28:58| I've heard arguments for strong, steady residential growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| I don't know how many of you all have been out there and looked around in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| but right behind this proposed development, there's a development called Lake Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| It's been there about three, maybe four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| Two summers ago, they had to auction off their lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| It's been there about four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8955)|
| 2:29:16| There's one house being built in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| It's directly behind this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| If you go west, straight down North Shore, there's a subdivision called the Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8961)|
| 2:29:27| And it's a paved road with some underground utilities in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8967)|
| 2:29:33| There's not one house in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| I drove through there a couple of Sundays ago after church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| People are starting to pull up in there and dump garbage off in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| The summit at Choteau, which is right down Choteau Road, it's been there about, what, six, eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8982)|
| 2:29:48| There's one house in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| And Turning Leaf is another one right down Early Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| It's suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| They've reduced their price lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| I mean, strong, steady residential growth, I would disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| But the bottom line really is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9001)|
| 2:30:02| This thing is so big, you know, if it would get scaled down to a couple of acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| I think you wouldn't see near the resistance that you're seeing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| But this is, for all of us in our neighborhood and Choteau Estates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9010)|
| 2:30:17| it's way out of character and way out of size for what could ever possibly be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9022)|
| 2:30:31| We have another for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9031)|
| 2:30:36| Okay, you can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| Good evening, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| My name is Jo Davis, and I, too, live in Mr. Ecker's subdivision in Millett-Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9042)|
| 2:30:47| which is directly across the street from Mr. Huber's proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| I've lived there for five years, and I wanted to say that I am in favor of Mr. Huber's proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9052)|
| 2:31:00| My main concern to begin with was the water drainage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9060)|
| 2:31:04| That area itself lends itself to many water drainage problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9064)|
| 2:31:09| And I have been very pleased with his openness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| with Mr. Huber's openness to communicate effectively and willingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| He actually brought Mr. Gray, his civil engineer, Mr. Dethridge, down for a meeting last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:27| to walk the water drainage that is in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9087)|
| 2:31:32| So my main concern is that that problem does not become any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| Now, I know that we all don't like change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| Believe me, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| But change is going to happen out there one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9104)|
| 2:31:48| I would say that I would prefer someone of Mr. Huber's caliber and of his developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| And I've had no working relationship with him at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| In fact, I called him right away to be on the stick about this water drainage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9117)|
| 2:32:03| And I have to say he has relieved my questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| So I am in favor of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| Take a look at the detention ponds that he's willing to put in extra money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| so that the water does not flow across to my property that I would have flood issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9134)|
| 2:32:19| because someone else might not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| It could be another housing development because something is going to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| They're going to sell that property and it's going to be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| And I would prefer it to be a nice, high-end, upscale development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| that's done correctly to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| And it's Joe Davis, 12518 Choteau Mill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9162)|
| 2:32:50| Thank you for giving the time that we could speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| I'm Dale Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| I live at 12252 Mossy Point Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| And I'm in favor of the Huber development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| I guess those of us who are in favor don't have signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| But we've lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| My wife and I moved there about six and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9187)|
| 2:33:10| And we like the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| The only drawback really is it's so far to go get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| When the grandkids show up and all of a sudden we need a few supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9196)|
| 2:33:20| the next thing you know you have to drive four or five miles to the Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9200)|
| 2:33:26| to go pick up a loaf of bread or a gallon of milk or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| And that goes for almost anything that happens that you can't really plan ahead for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9210)|
| 2:33:36| And I think that this new development will solve that kind of problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9216)|
| 2:33:40| But I think more importantly than that, what we have in this area out there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| is just kind of an accumulation of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| And there's no sense of community around the whole system there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9229)|
| 2:33:55| because it's just a bunch of houses built out in a field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| I think with some small commercial, especially with the restrictions that's on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9239)|
| 2:34:04| a commercial development will really help tie this whole area together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| and make it feel more like a community in that area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9248)|
| 2:34:13| And I think in addition to that, some of these failed developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| that were referred to earlier really need this kind of commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| because I wouldn't really want to live any further away from existing areas of trade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| than what we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| So I think all in all it's going to be a plus for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| and I really like the zoning restrictions on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| that it's going to make it for a first-class development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| My name is Dale Eakins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9279)|
| 2:34:44| I live at 12624 Barnstable Lane, which is Montgomery Cove in the adjacent subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| I've been a resident there since 2002, about a year prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9289)|
| 2:34:54| What drew us to the area is not the fact that there's lack of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| By their own admission, it's 4 1⁄2 miles from Kingston Park, which is not the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| I mean, to me, that is a bedroom community of just west Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| You do have Kroger. You do have Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| All those things are a few miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| But just like last night, I've got four kids at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| I have to run out to get milk because we're out, and I've got to go out in the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| I've got to go all the way to Kingston Park to get anything, and that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| I've lived in Charlotte. I've been in Atlanta. I've lived in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| And it's not uncommon to have little, small, you know, convenience stores in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9322)|
| 2:35:26| That's the very nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| And if you're going to have neighborhood commercial anywhere, that means it's got to be in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9328)|
| 2:35:32| And I like to see it in my neighborhood. It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| That's why I'm in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9337)|
| 2:35:48| How about you, Valerie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| May I have just one minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| I would also like to point out that at that particular intersection, the other three corners are residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9354)|
| 2:36:02| And I have lived in my house out there on Early Road for going on 17 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9362)|
| 2:36:10| and I moved out there because it was quiet, it was country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| And I think the concept that you want to put up with a commercial development of this scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9373)|
| 2:36:19| to save you a little trip out to get a loaf of bread or a gallon of milk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| is an extremely high price to pay for that milk and bread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9392)|
| 2:36:41| If I could have just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9401)|
| 2:36:42| As a resident of Choteau Peninsula, I live at Lakeshore Meadows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9402)|
| 2:36:48| if you've ever gone up or down Choteau Marina, that Choteau Lane past the marina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9408)|
| 2:36:55| it's a very windy, narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| There's no easement to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| So to cut down on traffic and maybe walk to this market would be so dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9421)|
| 2:37:08| I wouldn't advise it for anyone at any age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| And for the traffic to back up coming in and out of that neighborhood at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9432)|
| 2:37:17| I can't even imagine what my day would be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9437)|
| 2:37:21| As everyone said, yeah, I'd like the convenience of getting a gallon of milk in two minutes or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9441)|
| 2:37:29| But really, you can go across the Choteau North Shore a mile down the other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9449)|
| 2:37:36| and pick up that gallon of milk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| Again, for the size of this development, it's just insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9458)|
| 2:37:44| I mean, you're really looking at such a bottleneck for the residents in that Choteau area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9464)|
| 2:37:52| I don't usually even get involved in something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9472)|
| 2:37:55| My husband is a developer, so we are very aware of all of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| But this one in particular is really close to my heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| because it just doesn't make common sense to develop something like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9483)|
| 2:38:11| at this intersection where the roads, the traffic can't bear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9495)|
| 2:38:16| I need your name and address, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9496)|
| 2:38:19| Pat Anderson, Alaska, 3012 Whispering Cove, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9499)|
| 2:38:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9506)|
| 2:38:31| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| I'm in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9513)|
| 2:38:34| Let me go ahead and get your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| I'm Sally Jean Hale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| I'm 12119 Channel Point Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9518)|
| 2:38:43| I'm opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| I moved here 14 years ago from Los Angeles, specific to the countryside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9524)|
| 2:38:49| because it's beautiful, pristine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9529)|
| 2:38:53| To have this commercialism come in, neighborhood commercial go in, would be a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9533)|
| 2:39:00| First of all, if it were to happen, the first thing I would like to see is a rural metro out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9540)|
| 2:39:06| The closest one to my house is 7.5 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| You know there's some insurance policies that won't write homeowners insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9549)|
| 2:39:14| because it's too far out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| So what kind of insurance policies can they write for these businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| Secondly, we're moving backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| I am for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| I am for progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| My husband's company brought a lot of progress to this town, but there's no viability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9566)|
| 2:39:37| I'm not going to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| I went down to that corner market down by the railroad track to get cream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9578)|
| 2:39:43| They don't have the things we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| If I forget something at the store, a convenience store is not going to have what you forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9585)|
| 2:39:49| And a gallon of milk, what's the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| It's moving backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9592)|
| 2:39:53| There's no viability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| People are always going into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| Most workplaces are in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| They're going to shop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| They're not going to drive backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| So I really would like to see this not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9602)|
| 2:40:05| And if you're going to put something else in there, put condos or put patio homes for people downsizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9605)|
| 2:40:11| Put in, if it has to have something, put in an independent assisted living facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9611)|
| 2:40:18| some kind of something where people have a reason to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| But businesses, they won't survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9625)|
| 2:40:32| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| John Huber, I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9635)|
| 2:40:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9642)|
| 2:40:43| I was not able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| Being a grandfather, sometimes recitals tend to take precedent over everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9645)|
| 2:40:49| But there was a public hearing, I believe at Montgomery Cove on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9649)|
| 2:40:52| with regards to using some of this property for recreational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| Can you tell me about that hearing and what you would propose for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| I'm just trying to get some information here because I wasn't able to go to the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9663)|
| 2:41:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| Yeah, I attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9668)|
| 2:41:09| Terry Shuff and Doug Batteel with Parks and Recreation had a public meeting at Montgomery Cove Clubhouse last Wednesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9669)|
| 2:41:16| that I had attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| I had attended in an effort to make myself available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| and make property available through this development to possibly extend the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9681)|
| 2:41:29| We really envisioned the whole property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| I know it sounds, again, like it's a lot, 12, 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9691)|
| 2:41:34| But when you start taking out up to four acres being donated to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9694)|
| 2:41:40| ponds and things like that, it really gets a lot smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| But to speak specifically to it, we had always envisioned not necessarily walking from the Choctaw Peninsula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9703)|
| 2:41:49| which is probably three or four miles past this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9709)|
| 2:41:53| We have been working with Parks and Recreation about a possible connection, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| between the new Davis YMCA through Montgomery Cove, through Jefferson Park, and over to this corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9717)|
| 2:42:04| What we're trying to do is just create a mobile community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| People can ride their bikes over there once all the road improvements are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| We all agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| Again, I live in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| I drive those roads every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| What we're wanting to do is make the roads safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9737)|
| 2:42:23| possibly get with Parks and Recreation about extending this greenway off of there to make it safe for people to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9743)|
| 2:42:29| bring their kids, ride bikes, things like that, to get over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| So as far as your development specifically, you're not really talking about donating acreage for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9753)|
| 2:42:37| You're talking about extending the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| I think you mentioned two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| Two to four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9761)|
| 2:42:42| What you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| Yeah, two to four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9763)|
| 2:42:44| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9764)|
| 2:42:45| And that's what that meeting was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9765)|
| 2:42:46| When Ms. Schupp was there, her main thing was, you know, hey, you as the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9766)|
| 2:42:51| you want greenways that run parallel with the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| You want them that run with the waterways, which we do have a little bit of a waterway down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9774)|
| 2:42:59| And I'm open to either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| I think it just helps to make the whole society mobile, you know, just getting people out moving and walking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9781)|
| 2:43:08| In addition to Weigel's, what else will be going in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9788)|
| 2:43:11| Oh, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| We've got a few thoughts on some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| We've been in contact with some dry cleaners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| You know, we've talked to some daycares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| I know I've heard from a few folks out here that have kids, daycares, doctor's offices, the bistro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9802)|
| 2:43:29| You know, it's interesting that Ms. Hale mentioned the rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9809)|
| 2:43:32| We've actually, several months ago, we contacted rural metro when we started looking at this to try to create more of a community plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9812)|
| 2:43:39| They essentially said they're very interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| and they're waiting on us to contact them back once we have all of our approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9821)|
| 2:43:48| You know, possibly about having a satellite office for Knox County Sheriff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| You know, bistro type restaurant, these kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| Things that would truly just support the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| You know, we're not trying to get somebody to drive down from Kingston Pike all the way to the corner of North Shore and Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9839)|
| 2:44:05| We're just trying to keep the people in that area from having to drive to Kingston Pike to get what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9845)|
| 2:44:11| With regards to rural metro, this is something we've been working on for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| We are making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| And so I'm glad to hear you say that you're interested in talking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9856)|
| 2:44:19| because there's a couple of other options out there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| and hopefully we can get something resolved here in the next few months with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9861)|
| 2:44:24| because I know that is an issue for the folks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| 30-day postponement has been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| What are your thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9872)|
| 2:44:36| I've said many times before this body and MPC and city council and a lot of other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9876)|
| 2:44:42| hate to say no to a postponement, but I'm going to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9882)|
| 2:44:48| This one, for what purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9888)|
| 2:44:52| You know, we've spent, Mr. Huber has spent an inordinate amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9892)|
| 2:44:58| and effort to interface with the neighborhood groups, with interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9898)|
| 2:45:04| He has, if you will, pretty much been willing to concede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9904)|
| 2:45:10| and negotiate on a number of issues about, okay, all the lighting has to be recessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9910)|
| 2:45:19| We've got foot candles of permissible off-site measurement of light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9919)|
| 2:45:27| We've taken signage restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| We've taken a restriction on the utilization of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| We've gone to the neighborhood that identified itself as having a little bit of problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9933)|
| 2:45:39| with their existing detention pond and surface water problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9939)|
| 2:45:46| and made some provision to make sure that we're not going to add to that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9946)|
| 2:45:53| In fact, we're going to divert a lot of water from going over there that's going there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100125part2?start=9953)|
