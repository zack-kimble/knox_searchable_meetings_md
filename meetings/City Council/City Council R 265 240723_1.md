| 2:38:51| to protect our minority voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| because somehow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| bias and discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| just doesn't happen in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| That's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| When I hear this conversation, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| it's akin to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9548)|
| 2:39:13| really conversations that we hear more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| from conservative leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9556)|
| 2:39:19| who, as soon as you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| a person of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| achieving an achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| then, oh, man, we can just throw the Civil Rights Act away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| Oh, we don't need these measures in place any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9572)|
| 2:39:36| But we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| We do need to protect our majority-minority district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| We do need to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| how people identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| with their voting locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| Changing this to regional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| changing these districts to these regional names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| that don't line up with the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| I think is only going to cause more confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| It's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| break down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| some of the cohesion that we've seen develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| within districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| and it will only serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| those who hold the most power here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| not the district voters themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| That's my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| I'll just make some comments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9632)|
| 2:40:35| If it's all right, I'll take a turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| I've talked to a lot of people, a lot of people in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| with diverse opinions, and it really has shaped my brain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| and I don't feel 100% certain about any of these paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| so I'll share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| We've been aware of this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| We've been aware of this, as Councilwoman Ryder mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| for over a year, and tried to dissuade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| the trigger for this, but were unsuccessful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| Not necessarily under our power, but we tried in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| and I wish voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| that love the way we vote now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| would be as loud in that regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| as they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| I think this proposal is the best foot forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| and one of the main reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| that Councilwoman Parker just said that she thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| her proposal is better is because we do need guardrails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| and I actually think this produces a more diverse council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| like you see before you now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| I don't think we're special, and I don't necessarily think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| we defy gravity, but I do think looking at the past 60 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| and looking at Knoxville now are completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| We're not immune to those issues, but we are different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| we think good, we think different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| There are three main reasons I think that this should go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9713)|
| 2:41:56| before voters. One is that voters should decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| I think because you don't see a lot of certainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| a lot of these members here should give you pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| to be very certain about your opinion one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| We've never been really consistently uncertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| about something I don't think I've ever seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| so I would say that voters will get a choice for what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| and they will see the benefits and consequences of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| when they get to choose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| The second thing is I think this is the best continuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9743)|
| 2:42:26| of the most modern history we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9746)|
| 2:42:29| that's produced this diverse council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9749)|
| 2:42:32| and I do think the modern evidence before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| a lot of which Councilwoman McKenzie listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| points to this as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| I do think one thing that we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| is necessarily all the ripple effects of this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| that we didn't choose to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9767)|
| 2:42:50| because all, I can say with confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| all nine of these members are intent on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9773)|
| 2:42:56| fair representation, a diverse council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| and protection of minority populations in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| We're just trying to make sure we're clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| about what we think is the best path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9785)|
| 2:43:08| and so none of us are 100% sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9788)|
| 2:43:11| I do think this proposal would bring us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9791)|
| 2:43:14| into compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9794)|
| 2:43:17| The voters have always had a say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| and I think another thing that's been mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9800)|
| 2:43:23| about the 6th District particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| or district voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| I want to remind everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9809)|
| 2:43:32| that the 6th District representative in front of us now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| got more votes than anybody else on this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| in the 2021 election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| In terms of power and concentration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| Gwen McKenzie has oversized power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| My point is the city at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| voted for that council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| with more votes than any of the other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| that were running in that race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| I also want to say that there are other bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| in our community that have been listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| such as commission and school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| that I can tell you this that's very unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| to people that sit up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| It may seem like district-only voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| in other districts makes you care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| a lot about other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| If I only have to get votes from my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| out of my good heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| and I think I mean well and want to do well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| I don't really have to care a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| or answer the calls from somebody in the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| I don't have to answer calls from a rezoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| in the 2nd District because my voters don't care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| or might a little, but there's no incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| Mr. Bailey, I don't know if you're still awake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| but I thought you brought up some very good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9896)|
| 2:44:59| I would tell you from sitting in this seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| the way that I care about your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9902)|
| 2:45:05| is because I'm accountable to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| I think that driving force is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| if you hear anything from me tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| there's a unique perspective of these 9 people up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| that have to sit and listen and weigh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| and another person may not care as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| as these 9 might and we're also more than care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| accountable to voters in the subsequent election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| if we want to run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9929)|
| 2:45:32| I can think of very specific votes on this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9932)|
| 2:45:35| where not only good hearted intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| was the driving force behind votes of other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| for my district, but it helped that they had to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| for re-election the next year or the year after too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| I think that matter particularly is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| one that the state legislature has tossed on to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| or one that I think from my experience up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| mixed with my representation in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| points toward this being a better model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| and I think Knoxville is a lot different than it was 60 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| So while history points to the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| I think going back too far loses a bit of relevance for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| but I do agree we need guardrails for any path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| So I've manipulated the mic more than 5 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| I'm going to pass it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| We actually don't have to go back 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| we can go back 5 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| I was only elected 5 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9986)|
| 2:46:29| So if we go back 5 years, then you will have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| no at large elections of people of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9992)|
| 2:46:35| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9995)|
| 2:46:38| Just go back 5 years, you don't have to go back 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| What I wanted to speak on was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10004)|
| 2:46:47| one thing I wanted to speak on was the turnout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| for district 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| Because it was extraordinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10016)|
| 2:46:59| and different than how other races are treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| Other races didn't have the city mayor intervene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10022)|
| 2:47:05| and give an endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| Other races didn't have articles written in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| Knoxville News Sentinel about the history of the seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| the history of representation of the seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| the need to protect majority-minority districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| There are reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| And I don't want to discount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| Councilmember McKenzie's popularity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| the love in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| but we also have to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| the other factors that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| when you have a majority-minority district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| that you are trying to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| The other issue that I wanted to bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| because I forgot to raise this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| is the 50% plus one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| rule being applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| to the regional at-large races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10076)|
| 2:47:59| And the reason for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| I'm just seeing this system being designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| that's moving us away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| treating these as district representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| and treating them more as at-large representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| If you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| if you do the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10098)|
| 2:48:21| around the Voting Rights Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| one of the issues that can create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10104)|
| 2:48:27| a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| claim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| is the impact of that 50% plus one rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| in majority-minority districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| And this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| I mean, this is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| The Voting Rights Act is so complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| But this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10135)|
| 2:49:00| in district races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| you want to give candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10143)|
| 2:49:06| the opportunity to compete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10146)|
| 2:49:09| to build their name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| to not have a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10152)|
| 2:49:15| that can win it outright in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10155)|
| 2:49:18| There are multiple reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10158)|
| 2:49:21| and I didn't know this until I started doing the research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| but multiple reasons why the courts have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10164)|
| 2:49:27| had some pause when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10167)|
| 2:49:30| the 50% plus one rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| in district-level primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10173)|
| 2:49:37| And what that impact is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10177)|
| 2:49:40| on majority-minority districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| So that's another issue that I would like for us to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| But it seems like there is support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10185)|
| 2:49:48| for this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| and it seems like it is moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| and I find that really unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| Because I hope what the voters are seeing tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10197)|
| 2:50:00| is that there's no clarity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| There's very little support, it seems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| here at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| What everyone, well, I won't say everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| but what I hear from council members is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10212)|
| 2:50:15| let's toss it to the voters to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10215)|
| 2:50:18| And to me, that is a dereliction of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10218)|
| 2:50:21| Especially when we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| obligations to uphold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10224)|
| 2:50:27| civil rights law and to understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| to spend more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| on these issues than our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| so that we can understand them and best guide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| We shouldn't put proposals forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10239)|
| 2:50:42| and sit back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| well, we'll see what the community thinks is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| We should champion issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| If we don't understand it, I would abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| But if you're ready to champion the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| and say to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10257)|
| 2:51:00| this is what I feel like is the next best step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10260)|
| 2:51:03| for our community, then support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| But putting things up and saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| I don't know if this is best and I trust my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| Knoxville, you deserve better representation than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| Councilwoman Roberts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10278)|
| 2:51:21| Should I just go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| I'm not sure that what I just heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| is a synthesis of what I just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| I'm not sure that what I just heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| is a synthesis of what I just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| I've heard tonight, but that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| Apparently the folks that came to support you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10308)|
| 2:51:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10311)|
| 2:51:54| Hi, I believe that we have a representative here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| from MTAS, so I'm not sure that you would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| to answer my question or Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| or Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| I believe there are 16 other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| that do what is proposed in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| I'll have to pull up the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| I'm Stephanie O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| I am a legal consultant at MTAS and our address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| is 1610 University Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10344)|
| 2:52:27| Let me pull up that list real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| And they may not currently follow that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10350)|
| 2:52:33| They are all going through the same review process as you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| They were all examining the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10356)|
| 2:52:39| but this is as of December of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10359)|
| 2:52:42| so it's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10362)|
| 2:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10365)|
| 2:52:48| While we're waiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| I just want to be clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| because it said something about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| we're not championing this or that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| I champion the system we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10380)|
| 2:53:03| and I went to Nashville to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| I'm not going to go into detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10389)|
| 2:53:12| but folks that do not live in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| made the decision that we don't get to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| so I can't put that on the ballot for the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| I didn't make it personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| I didn't make it personal and I do not, yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| I can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| This was provided by MTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| Monterey, Morristown, Mossheim, New Tazewell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| Oliver Springs, Red Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10425)|
| 2:53:48| Spring Hill, Tazewell, and Waverly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10428)|
| 2:53:51| Okay. Mr. Johnson, could you email that to members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10431)|
| 2:53:54| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| That is my question for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10437)|
| 2:54:03| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10446)|
| 2:54:09| Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| the list that you did for me on those 16 cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| was that shared with all council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10455)|
| 2:54:18| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| Could you share that with all council members, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10464)|
| 2:54:27| When we are looking at changing our election system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| we have to look at other cities that are similarly situated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10470)|
| 2:54:33| The largest city on that list of 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10473)|
| 2:54:36| has a population of 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| Nowhere near our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| I would have to look it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10483)|
| 2:54:46| but no one has a Black population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| the size of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| I don't know how concentrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10492)|
| 2:54:55| There is a whole list of things that you have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| when evaluating a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| to see if they are able to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| a majority-minority district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10504)|
| 2:55:07| Knoxville checks all of those boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| Black community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| identifiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| It checks the boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| I can't tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| about all of those other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| but I can tell you, based on population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| and demographics, they do not compare to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| Just lifting them up as an example means nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| Absolutely nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10533)|
| 2:55:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| Actually, I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10543)|
| 2:55:46| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10546)|
| 2:55:49| We have asked for MTAS to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10549)|
| 2:55:52| MTAS is here tonight. I would like to hear from MTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| Because I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| gleaned a lot of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| from the research that MTAS itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10561)|
| 2:56:04| has done on at-large voting districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| In the article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| that I read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| that MTAS developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10572)|
| 2:56:17| it is pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10577)|
| 2:56:21| when a municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| should or should not consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| an at-large voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| One thing that the MTAS article says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| a local government should be able to notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| that if it has a significant minority population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| in identifiable pockets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| an at-large election system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| or a combination district at-large is automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| Does that language sound familiar to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| That article that you read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| was written by my predecessor 21 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| I think a lot of cities were going through similar review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10622)|
| 2:57:05| He has since passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| I cannot ask him about his intent of this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| That is from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| That has not been reviewed by an attorney until I was asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| to look at it in preparation for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10637)|
| 2:57:20| That does come from that article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10640)|
| 2:57:23| Part of what MTAS does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| is advise municipalities on the risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| that you will assume should you proceed with a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10649)|
| 2:57:32| We, as legal consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10652)|
| 2:57:35| have taken the view that we will advise you of all the risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10655)|
| 2:57:38| and then usually we are the most risk-averse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| is the method that we recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10661)|
| 2:57:44| That is what this article comes from the perspective of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| as the least risk for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| especially for public funds and all the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| that would be at risk if it was challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10673)|
| 2:57:56| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10676)|
| 2:57:59| That is all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10679)|
| 2:58:02| Just to follow up, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| That article was from 21 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| That article is about the likelihood of a municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| to be challenged by a suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| based on the result of elections. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| It is not a recommendation as to which voting approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| produces a more diverse council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| or representative body. Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| There are lines in it that you would need to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| as a municipality and what could be challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| because of the risk of your municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| Thank you. I just want to follow up on a few other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| I think some of the comments that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| about specific elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| actually I think we have discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10724)|
| 2:58:47| probably six different elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10727)|
| 2:58:50| including Mr. Robinson's dating back to 1969.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| I think most recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10733)|
| 2:58:56| I think what the point I am trying to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| is that no election is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| You can look back 60 years, you can look back five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| but no elections are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| We have never as a city, I think this is really clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10748)|
| 2:59:11| in terms of going back to a certain date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| or going backwards or forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| it is dishonest to be certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| I think that that is manipulation at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| I think this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| will never have voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| the way we are about to vote, whatever path we choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| So for anybody that says they have a crystal ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| and knows exactly what is going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| again I think is unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| I also think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| I do think this is a better approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| So let me be clear about that to every voter in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| I think that this proposal is a better way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| to represent districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| I think it is fair to put it in front of the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| which by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10799)|
| 3:00:02| all of us in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10802)|
| 3:00:05| legitimately, I can tell you so many stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| of watching other bodies in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10808)|
| 3:00:11| vote without any repercussions of other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| about issues in that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| where to place a thing that does not belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| where to place a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| where to rezone something from this to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| All three of these items have to go to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10826)|
| 3:00:29| We cannot unilaterally make any of these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10829)|
| 3:00:32| So for us to sit up here and suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| that we are just going to throw it over the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| to you all, the public, without any direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10838)|
| 3:00:41| or recommendation is fanciful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| With that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| Mr. Swanson, I think it was a question earlier about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10847)|
| 3:00:50| can this proposal and the next proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10850)|
| 3:00:53| be approved by the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10853)|
| 3:00:56| without conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| I think you wanted to weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10859)|
| 3:01:02| I think it is important for you to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10862)|
| 3:01:05| and recognize that the law as it currently exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| does not allow you to submit to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| the question of, do you want this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10871)|
| 3:01:14| or that system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10874)|
| 3:01:17| What you have to submit to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| is a question that is answered yes or no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| when we amend our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| Not from a policy point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| The policy is up for you all to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10889)|
| 3:01:32| That is why people elected you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10892)|
| 3:01:35| But from a legal viewpoint, I do not believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10895)|
| 3:01:38| that you can responsibly adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| both the Roberto Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| and the first part of the Parker Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10904)|
| 3:01:47| because they are just logically inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10907)|
| 3:01:50| with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10910)|
| 3:01:53| If you submit both of those things to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10916)|
| 3:01:59| It creates a tremendous legal dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10919)|
| 3:02:02| I do not think you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10922)|
| 3:02:05| I think they are so internally inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| that that is not something that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| available for you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10934)|
| 3:02:17| portions of the Parker version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10937)|
| 3:02:20| of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| that are not inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10943)|
| 3:02:26| The second provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| provides that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| if there is a tie vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| the two top number of votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10955)|
| 3:02:38| would go forward even if that is three or four people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10958)|
| 3:02:41| that would go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| That is not inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| You can adopt that portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| but if you adopt the Roberto Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| I do not believe you can adopt the first portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| or if you adopt the first portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10976)|
| 3:02:59| or the entire Parker Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| I do not think you can adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10982)|
| 3:03:05| the Roberto Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10985)|
| 3:03:08| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10988)|
| 3:03:11| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| Any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| I have a legal question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| based on what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11012)|
| 3:03:35| If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11015)|
| 3:03:38| both were approved first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11018)|
| 3:03:41| just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11021)|
| 3:03:44| because somebody will wonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11024)|
| 3:03:47| if you approved both first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11030)|
| 3:03:53| only the one that got approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11033)|
| 3:03:56| and ordinances adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11036)|
| 3:03:59| I am just stating the obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11039)|
| 3:04:02| Hypothetically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11042)|
| 3:04:05| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| There is a motion on Councilwoman Helsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| I have a question. You were talking about the tiebreaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11051)|
| 3:04:14| which is jumping to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| I thought you said the other day that was against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| No, I said it could be interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| potentially as against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11063)|
| 3:04:26| I know that there has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| conversation with the state election commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| The state election commissioner offered the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| that that particular portion of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| would not violate the statute that I referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| I will defer to the state election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| commission with regard to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11090)|
| 3:04:53| We have a motion by Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| Second. A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| All those in favor please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11105)|

| 3:05:17| to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11117)|
| 3:05:20| specifically Chapter 412 of the Private Acts of 1923| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11120)|

| 3:05:29| to fix the boundaries of said municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11129)|

| 3:05:41| so as to set a process for primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11141)|

| 3:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11201)|
| 3:06:44| Sorry, we do have four people have signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11207)|

| 3:06:55| or do we need to suspend the rules for this one as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| We have a motion to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11221)|

| 3:07:10| Any discussion about the move to suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11230)|
| 3:07:13| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11233)|
| 3:07:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11236)|
| 3:07:19| Motion passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11239)|
| 3:07:22| Next we have Bentley Marlow followed by Rick Roach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11242)|
| 3:07:25| Deidre Harper, and Jax Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11245)|
| 3:07:28| Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11248)|
| 3:07:31| If we're going to be hell-bent on taking action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11251)|
| 3:07:34| to force a ballot initiative for a charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11254)|
| 3:07:37| I think this would be my preferred one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11257)|
| 3:07:40| This allows the districts to have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| It allows each district to have a vested interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11263)|
| 3:07:46| in participating and hopefully the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11266)|
| 3:07:48| to show some more voting interest and get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11268)|
| 3:07:51| to the ballot box more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11271)|
| 3:07:54| Because it's local then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11274)|
| 3:07:57| This is somebody you're going to know that lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11277)|
| 3:08:00| down the street, around the corner, within the 30 blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11280)|
| 3:08:03| that we heard someone talk about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11283)|
| 3:08:06| I think that the concerns about keeping a cohesive view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11286)|
| 3:08:09| and keeping everyone that's elected from the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11289)|
| 3:08:12| involved in the city is simply that you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11292)|
| 3:08:15| motivating people to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11295)|
| 3:08:18| You're motivated to take on the public scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| and the ridicule and all the work if you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11301)|
| 3:08:24| devoutly in love with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11304)|
| 3:08:27| I love Mechanicsville, but I love the whole city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11307)|
| 3:08:30| It takes the whole city to make the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11310)|
| 3:08:33| If you were to just carve off the 6th district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11313)|
| 3:08:36| we'd be missing out on a whole lot of good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11316)|
| 3:08:39| But if we take away the 6th district, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11319)|
| 3:08:42| to be missing out on a lot of good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11322)|
| 3:08:45| So we're all in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| But what the flip side of that coin is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11328)|
| 3:08:51| is that we could actually have some productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| stuff done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| Because when everyone's beholden to the entire city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11337)|
| 3:09:00| and one portion of the city votes in such a greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| turnout, we have ridiculous stuff like hour-long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11343)|
| 3:09:06| meetings about a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| An hour's long meeting about a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| A duplex that's allowed by the rules that are in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| that's fair game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11355)|
| 3:09:18| They got their special use by the rules at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11361)|
| 3:09:24| But we had a torturous, hour's long discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11364)|
| 3:09:27| at this board, only because that duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| happened to be in the 2nd district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11370)|
| 3:09:33| And it happened to be that you were answering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11373)|
| 3:09:36| to every one of those voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| I get duplex approvals in the same manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| over in Mechanicsville, the 6th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11382)|
| 3:09:45| It's often approved with no discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11385)|
| 3:09:48| The same can be said for duplexes in the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11388)|
| 3:09:51| I mean the 3rd, the 4th, the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11391)|
| 3:09:54| But by God, the 2nd is special somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11394)|
| 3:09:57| It makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11397)|
| 3:10:00| And so if by eliminating the 2nd's ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| vote on everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11403)|
| 3:10:06| it scares everyone so much, let's ask ourselves why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11406)|
| 3:10:09| And all we have to do is go back, what was it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11409)|
| 3:10:12| a month and a half, two months ago to that duplex problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11412)|
| 3:10:15| That's what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| But I don't think that if we said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11418)|
| 3:10:21| you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11421)|
| 3:10:24| Districts 1 through 1 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11424)|
| 3:10:27| only get to select their own individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11427)|
| 3:10:30| I don't think that the council person elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| in Charlie's district, District 5, is not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| somewhat paying attention or concerned about a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| in District 2 or 6, because they care about the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11439)|
| 3:10:42| as a whole and they care about what precedent would be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| So I think that while there's some merit to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11445)|
| 3:10:48| there's a great little pitch piece that it brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11448)|
| 3:10:51| us all together and makes us all accountable and all united.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11451)|
| 3:10:54| It also has that dirty flip side that we have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| too accountable and we have to sometimes endorse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| some torturous discussions over something as simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11460)|
| 3:11:03| as a duplex, a house with just two doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| Because we have many houses all over this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| that have just one door but they've got multiple families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11469)|
| 3:11:12| in it. Most people don't even know that they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11472)|
| 3:11:15| The neighbors might not even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11475)|
| 3:11:18| And that is, I think, the flip side of this argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11478)|
| 3:11:21| The flip side of the discussion is simple things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11481)|
| 3:11:24| like a duplex in District 2 causes so much consternation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11484)|
| 3:11:27| when in reality, it should just be treated like a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11487)|
| 3:11:32| in District 6, which is routinely approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| with no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| So I find that concern to be a bit hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| And I think that if you just think back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| district representation, every district is like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| every neighborhood. They're all a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11507)|
| 3:11:50| They're all a little unique. We need those flavors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| to make a really good batch of whatever we're cooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| If we're just going to throw a handful of white salt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11516)|
| 3:11:59| on everything, it's not going to be edible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11519)|
| 3:12:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11522)|
| 3:12:05| Next up, Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11525)|
| 3:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11538)|
| 3:12:21| Rick Roach, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11541)|
| 3:12:26| If one person casts a ballot in District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11546)|
| 3:12:29| and it's for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11549)|
| 3:12:32| and it's for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11552)|
| 3:12:35| and it's for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11555)|
| 3:12:38| and it's for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11558)|
| 3:12:41| and it's for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11561)|
| 3:12:44| that district has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11564)|
| 3:12:47| If you win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11567)|
| 3:12:50| If that's the only ballot that's cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11570)|
| 3:12:53| That's the status of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11573)|
| 3:12:56| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11579)|
| 3:13:02| So then, if you want to start asking questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| about how we got to the point where only one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11585)|
| 3:13:08| cast a ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11588)|
| 3:13:11| well then we can have that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11591)|
| 3:13:14| and you all will know what the real deal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11594)|
| 3:13:17| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11597)|
| 3:13:20| Either nobody gives a poop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11600)|
| 3:13:23| or the people have been conditioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11603)|
| 3:13:26| continuously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11606)|
| 3:13:29| over decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11609)|
| 3:13:32| under this governance structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11612)|
| 3:13:35| called City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| of the mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| and the dictates of the Planning Commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| who are appointed by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11627)|
| 3:13:50| and County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11630)|
| 3:13:53| The people who make the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11633)|
| 3:13:56| about what a community looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11636)|
| 3:13:59| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11639)|
| 3:14:02| that mentality carries into the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11642)|
| 3:14:05| electoral process, and you only got one person voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11645)|
| 3:14:10| But you all have put those conditions in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11650)|
| 3:14:12| whether you want to admit it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11652)|
| 3:14:15| You all have structured it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11655)|
| 3:14:18| And you do not want to take responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11658)|
| 3:14:21| for structuring it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11661)|
| 3:14:27| And it gets old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11667)|
| 3:14:32| You cannot tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| that you all, when you went to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11675)|
| 3:14:38| or wherever it was you went and met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| the representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11680)|
| 3:14:43| that you came back and sounded the alarm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11686)|
| 3:14:49| You just didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11689)|
| 3:14:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| There was a workshop, wasn't there a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| I attended a workshop here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11698)|
| 3:15:01| Of course, you know, you do your workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| at 4 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11704)|
| 3:15:07| and nobody can come and attend those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11707)|
| 3:15:10| But I went to that workshop and the one that I remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| and you had people from Nashville come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| Metro Nashville come, and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11716)|
| 3:15:19| the problems of dealing with the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| and how the state legislature was taken over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11722)|
| 3:15:25| and all this other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11725)|
| 3:15:28| Man, it's hard to keep up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11728)|
| 3:15:31| It's really hard to keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11731)|
| 3:15:34| And every one of you were sounding the alarm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| about state government taking over the responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11737)|
| 3:15:40| of the local governance systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11740)|
| 3:15:43| Every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11743)|
| 3:15:46| that was in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11746)|
| 3:15:50| So, you can't act like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11750)|
| 3:15:53| when you see negative results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11753)|
| 3:15:56| locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11756)|
| 3:15:59| in East Knoxville, Mechanicsville, Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| okay, you can't act like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| you have nothing to do with it. You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| Because the decisions that you make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11767)|
| 3:16:10| and that you support, if you've got to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11770)|
| 3:16:13| and sue or be sued by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11773)|
| 3:16:16| or you sue the state or whatever that process entails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11776)|
| 3:16:19| stand up for the people that you say you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11779)|
| 3:16:23| And in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11783)|
| 3:16:26| you know, the non-voting community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11786)|
| 3:16:29| you still represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11789)|
| 3:16:32| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| Whether it's a district system or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| but the district system puts the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| directly within that district, and then you work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11800)|
| 3:16:43| on the conditions that will get those people to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11803)|
| 3:16:46| and be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11806)|
| 3:16:49| by doing the first thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| that they are literally required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| and that's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11815)|
| 3:16:58| So, we've got people registered to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11818)|
| 3:17:01| but we don't vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11821)|
| 3:17:04| for senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11824)|
| 3:17:07| They really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| Because they think you all jerry-rig everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11830)|
| 3:17:13| Excuse me, that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| ethnically...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11836)|
| 3:17:19| I'm sorry, excuse me, I'll take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11839)|
| 3:17:22| But it's a rigged system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11842)|
| 3:17:25| and you all know it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11845)|
| 3:17:28| so quit playing games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| Deidre Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11853)|
| 3:17:45| Deidre Harper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11865)|
| 3:17:48| Knoxville 37917 in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11868)|
| 3:17:51| of Councilwoman Amelia Parker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11871)|
| 3:17:54| Charter Amendment proposal, and I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11874)|
| 3:17:57| hearing the conversations around that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11877)|
| 3:18:00| what was presented before us and that we've been unsure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| we don't know, there's no right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| But what is mind boggling to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11885)|
| 3:18:08| is that many of you who have said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11888)|
| 3:18:11| have signed off already on Roberto's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11891)|
| 3:18:14| before we even had discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11894)|
| 3:18:16| And sometimes that is a disadvantage I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11896)|
| 3:18:19| because you don't, to me you've already made a stance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11899)|
| 3:18:22| but then you come on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| and then you say how you're unsure or that you're unaware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11904)|
| 3:18:27| and that you wanna leave it up to voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11907)|
| 3:18:30| to determine what is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| And I wonder how many of you have had conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| with your district before this particular conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11915)|
| 3:18:38| that's being had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11918)|
| 3:18:40| I think that would have been important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| And I'm gonna say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11922)|
| 3:18:43| and I wish Reverend Middlebrook was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11923)|
| 3:18:46| in response to the NAACP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11926)|
| 3:18:49| because we oftentimes look to those particular organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11929)|
| 3:18:52| to sign off on what the black community needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11932)|
| 3:18:55| and what the black community feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11935)|
| 3:18:58| but they've not done their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11938)|
| 3:19:00| in speaking to the black community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11940)|
| 3:19:01| on what we think and how we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11941)|
| 3:19:03| So I guess I'm saying that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11943)|
| 3:19:06| to think about that sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11946)|
| 3:19:07| before going to these particular organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| and looking to them to give you a check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11949)|
| 3:19:12| meaning, okay, and that this is what we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11952)|
| 3:19:15| this is what is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11955)|
| 3:19:16| and this is what we want to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| because that's not always true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| Because a lot of people in the city and in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11960)|
| 3:19:24| and specifically district six have differences of opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11964)|
| 3:19:28| and I would have appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11968)|
| 3:19:29| if the organization that's gonna stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11969)|
| 3:19:30| and say, that's what I need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11970)|
| 3:19:32| that's what I deserve as a member of district six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11972)|
| 3:19:35| that I would have been asked about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11975)|
| 3:19:36| before writing a letter to say, this is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11976)|
| 3:19:40| So I would like you all to think about that moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11980)|
| 3:19:44| when you look to these organizations to sign off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11984)|
| 3:19:47| And council member Tommy, I know you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11987)|
| 3:19:50| about being district specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11990)|
| 3:19:54| does not give you an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11994)|
| 3:19:55| to focus on the district at large or the city at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| but I find that hard to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| and I don't wanna call it lazy politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12001)|
| 3:20:05| but I don't think that that's fair to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| just because you're a district representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| that you shouldn't be concerned about the city as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| because when you make your vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12012)|
| 3:20:13| your vote is gonna determine the output| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12013)|
| 3:20:15| as a city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12015)|
| 3:20:16| So if you're gonna sit up there and say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12016)|
| 3:20:18| well, I'm just a district representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12018)|
| 3:20:20| and I'm only gonna focus on my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12020)|
| 3:20:22| I think that's an injustice to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12022)|
| 3:20:24| because you don't only vote for just your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12024)|
| 3:20:28| And I don't think that going citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12028)|
| 3:20:30| is gonna hold you accountable to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12030)|
| 3:20:32| because if you can't have morals within yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12032)|
| 3:20:35| to realize that you as a representative for a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12035)|
| 3:20:37| is also representative of a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12037)|
| 3:20:39| I don't think that changing the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12039)|
| 3:20:41| is gonna make you do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12041)|
| 3:20:42| because that's gonna have to come from within you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12042)|
| 3:20:45| before somebody can mandate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12045)|
| 3:20:47| So to use that as an excuse or to use that as a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12047)|
| 3:20:50| why we should go to citywide elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12050)|
| 3:20:53| I just think it doesn't hold substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| and I don't think that it's a fair thing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12055)|
| 3:21:01| And then the last thing that I wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12061)|
| 3:21:04| is when I went to the workshop, I did attend the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12064)|
| 3:21:08| and I actually left the workshop still confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12068)|
| 3:21:10| I left the workshop still not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12070)|
| 3:21:12| what we were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12072)|
| 3:21:13| because under Roberto's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| it was almost presented as if we are just renaming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12075)|
| 3:21:18| the districts for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12078)|
| 3:21:20| But when I got to thinking about it a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| it was to really change the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| that we are voting as a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| and we're going to citywide elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| So I don't know if that was just on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| that sat here for the whole time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| and maybe misunderstood what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| but I think maybe we're masking this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| as to be approved as renaming to regionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12097)|
| 3:21:40| so that make it easier for conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12100)|
| 3:21:42| when talking to community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| when actuality we are really changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| the way we are doing our voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| So I think it's masking what we're really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12109)|
| 3:21:52| what you're really trying to put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12112)|
| 3:21:54| and it's not being intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12114)|
| 3:21:55| and being upfront and honest about the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12115)|
| 3:21:57| that we are really having today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12117)|
| 3:22:00| So at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12120)|
| 3:22:01| I do support Councilwoman Amelia Parker's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12121)|
| 3:22:04| and I think it's an injustice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12124)|
| 3:22:05| that we are not able to support both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| There's nobody that signed off on her proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| but we sit up here and say that we're confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| and we don't know what's best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12134)|
| 3:22:15| but we all sign off on one particular one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| and it makes it hard for me to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12138)|
| 3:22:20| that you all are genuine in what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12140)|
| 3:22:22| And I don't think you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12142)|
| 3:22:24| So our people have questions and we come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| and we're inferior and we're not inferior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12147)|
| 3:22:31| we're furiated about the conversations that are having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| because it seems like you're lying to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| and you're really not being honest about how you really feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12155)|
| 3:22:38| so I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12158)|
| 3:22:42| Next up, Jax Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12162)|
| 3:22:48| Is Jax Fox still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12168)|
| 3:22:51| Okay, that's the only speakers we have signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12175)|
| 3:22:57| if you could introduce this ordinance to get us started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12177)|
| 3:23:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12184)|
| 3:23:09| I believe as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12189)|
| 3:23:14| I'll actually tell a little bit of background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12194)|
| 3:23:16| since I have a little bit of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12196)|
| 3:23:17| but looking into how we conduct elections in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12197)|
| 3:23:29| has been an interest of mine for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| Obviously, I was a part of a movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12212)|
| 3:23:36| called the City Council Movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| that formed because we saw barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12217)|
| 3:23:42| to individuals being able to be elected to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12222)|
| 3:23:47| People were intimidated by the need to run citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12227)|
| 3:23:55| even though they were a well-respected leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12235)|
| 3:23:57| in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12237)|
| 3:24:00| People were intimidated by the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12240)|
| 3:24:02| that the city hadn't elected much diversity in its past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12242)|
| 3:24:09| except if you come from the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| that became almost a rule in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12251)|
| 3:24:18| But beyond that, people were not willing to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12258)|
| 3:24:25| that even more diversity was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12265)|
| 3:24:30| And we didn't just go in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12270)|
| 3:24:32| oh yeah, everything's changed in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12272)|
| 3:24:35| A whole new mentality has been adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12275)|
| 3:24:40| and left people on their own to run for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12280)|
| 3:24:43| and they just happened to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| No, we've done amazing amounts of fundraising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12285)|
| 3:24:52| building the infrastructure, training individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12292)|
| 3:24:55| on how to help candidates running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12295)|
| 3:25:00| All of these things that none of us were doing before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12300)|
| 3:25:04| all of us have full-time jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12304)|
| 3:25:06| but it was something that was important to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12306)|
| 3:25:10| because we saw how it was impacting our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12310)|
| 3:25:16| for our representatives to feel more accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12316)|
| 3:25:20| to the wealthier parts of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12320)|
| 3:25:23| than they feel accountable to the parts of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| that have low voter turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12326)|
| 3:25:29| And so we wanted to get more diverse people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12329)|
| 3:25:31| but we also wanted to increase voter turnout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| to hold people accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12333)|
| 3:25:38| When we formed City Council Movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| and began running individuals for election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| we also had conversations and hosted people's assemblies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12343)|
| 3:25:48| to talk about how our elections are structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12348)|
| 3:25:51| and what might be a more democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12351)|
| 3:25:54| We actually have been engaging in these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12354)|
| 3:25:59| since at least 2018, probably 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12359)|
| 3:26:04| And of course, there were lots of ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12364)|
| 3:26:06| that came out of those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12366)|
| 3:26:09| A lot of folks who lean towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| a ranked choice voting type system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12371)|
| 3:26:15| And then we had a new state law adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| that outlawed ranked choice voting in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12377)|
| 3:26:21| So that was not a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12381)|
| 3:26:22| that we could continue or continue to explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12382)|
| 3:26:26| But I still wanted to make improvements to our elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12386)|
| 3:26:31| and to other parts of our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| And that's why I brought a charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12393)|
| 3:26:35| multiple charter amendments before this body two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12395)|
| 3:26:40| And at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12400)|
| 3:26:42| when those charter amendment proposals were unsuccessful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| I asked for a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12406)|
| 3:26:50| to discuss a charter review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12410)|
| 3:26:53| And that request for a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12413)|
| 3:26:56| has gone to all of us on City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| to vote on and prioritize for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12419)|
| 3:27:05| So there are many people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| who have been thinking about our elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| trying to improve them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| engaged in these issues for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12431)|
| 3:27:15| While some folks have come to a very quick conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12435)|
| 3:27:18| in the last month, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12438)|
| 3:27:21| I find that very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12441)|
| 3:27:28| But we are where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12448)|
| 3:27:30| We're in a place that none of us like to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12450)|
| 3:27:34| I'm a little bit more comfortable maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12454)|
| 3:27:36| because I have been considering these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12456)|
| 3:27:42| And for me, a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12462)|
| 3:27:46| made the decision that district only primaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12466)|
| 3:27:50| and general elections for district representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12470)|
| 3:27:54| would be best for our local democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12474)|
| 3:27:56| So that's just where my opinion lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12476)|
| 3:28:00| I want to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12480)|
| 3:28:06| a compromise if we can find one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12486)|
| 3:28:11| And while I may not agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12491)|
| 3:28:15| that we should move to a regional at-large system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12495)|
| 3:28:21| I'm still in support of the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12501)|
| 3:28:26| that are contained in my ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12506)|
| 3:28:30| even without changing to district only elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12510)|
| 3:28:38| Just to clarify, my ordinance serves three purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12518)|
| 3:28:45| The first part that was mentioned by Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12525)|
| 3:28:49| is the part that aligns with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12529)|
| 3:28:53| and moves us to district only elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12533)|
| 3:28:56| for district representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12536)|
| 3:29:00| The second part, which was briefly mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12540)|
| 3:29:05| includes language that would prevent a tie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12545)|
| 3:29:08| in a primary in the city, in all city elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12548)|
| 3:29:11| mayor, judge, city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12551)|
| 3:29:15| And then by state law, we would still be able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12555)|
| 3:29:18| in the general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12558)|
| 3:29:21| in the general election, as a city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12561)|
| 3:29:25| in the case of a tie, either select a winner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12565)|
| 3:29:29| or decide to send the race to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12569)|
| 3:29:33| to send the election to a runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12573)|
| 3:29:36| which obviously would be my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12576)|
| 3:29:40| But in a primary, there is no time for a runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12580)|
| 3:29:44| The only option is for city council to choose that winner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12584)|
| 3:29:47| but this is an easy fix, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12587)|
| 3:29:52| of moving a few words around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12592)|
| 3:29:55| that remove that possibility from our elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12595)|
| 3:30:01| The third issue, which has come up multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12601)|
| 3:30:05| is allowing at-large races to win in the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12605)|
| 3:30:12| with 50% plus one of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12612)|
| 3:30:15| And with the adoption of the changes to the fifth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12615)|
| 3:30:23| and moving the fifth district to the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12623)|
| 3:30:26| with all other district races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12626)|
| 3:30:30| that leaves the at-large seats, A, B, C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12630)|
| 3:30:35| mayor and judge in the same year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12635)|
| 3:30:40| And currently mayor and judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12640)|
| 3:30:43| are both able to win in the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12643)|
| 3:30:47| with 50% plus one of the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12647)|
| 3:30:50| but at-large seats are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12650)|
| 3:30:53| And so we could have a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12653)|
| 3:30:58| where we see the same voters showing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12658)|
| 3:31:02| to vote in all of those races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12662)|
| 3:31:07| They vote, you know, a majority for mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12667)|
| 3:31:11| a majority for judge, and a majority for at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12671)|
| 3:31:16| Similar outcomes in all races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12676)|
| 3:31:20| And the mayor and judge race would finish in the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12680)|
| 3:31:23| but the at-large races would have to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| Councilwoman, you're just out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| Would you, you wanna come back or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12687)|
| 3:31:30| Oh, yeah, sure, I can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12690)|
| 3:31:31| Or you wanna finish up quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| Your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12693)|
| 3:31:37| Well, what I was gonna say is actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12697)|
| 3:31:41| just in my introduction is, there are those three parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12701)|
| 3:31:44| And what I would like to do is make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12704)|
| 3:31:48| that what we are considering now are the last two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12708)|
| 3:31:55| And that I would recommend an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12715)|
| 3:32:00| You can look on packet page 850.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12720)|
| 3:32:05| And we would amend that section by removing the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12725)|
| 3:32:12| after manner of holding elections be amended so as to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12732)|
| 3:32:19| We would take out all language after set, set a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12739)|
| 3:32:27| up to a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12747)|
| 3:32:32| a council district election and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12752)|
| 3:32:39| All right, if it's okay, we'll pause just for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12759)|
| 3:32:41| and see if there's any discussion on the original proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12761)|
| 3:32:45| before we go into the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12765)|
| 3:32:51| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12771)|
| 3:32:53| So Councilmember Parker, if I understand you correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| you're saying that only the at-large candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12776)|
| 3:32:59| could have a 50% plus one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12779)|
| 3:33:02| but not the district representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12782)|
| 3:33:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12785)|
| 3:33:06| Could you expand a little bit on why you chose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| to leave the district rep out with the 50% plus one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12789)|
| 3:33:13| The research that I did suggested that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12793)|
| 3:33:16| especially in cities like ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12796)|
| 3:33:18| that have a majority minority district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12798)|
| 3:33:22| that a 50% plus one opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12802)|
| 3:33:30| makes those less competitive races at the district level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12810)|
| 3:33:41| Additionally, my reasoning for changing the at-large race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12821)|
| 3:33:53| is because that 50% plus one is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12833)|
| 3:33:57| for the mayor and judge race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12837)|
| 3:34:00| that takes place in the same year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12840)|
| 3:34:05| And so the rules will be the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12845)|
| 3:34:08| for all elections happening in that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12848)|
| 3:34:12| And the 50% plus one rule for district races| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12852)|
| 3:34:20| has not been raised at city council yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12860)|
| 3:34:24| So it was not an issue that I felt passionately about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12864)|
| 3:34:27| that I felt like needed to be raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12867)|
| 3:34:31| I felt the at-large position has been raised enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12871)|
| 3:34:35| that it should at least be included for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12875)|
| 3:34:38| I'm not completely tied to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12878)|
| 3:34:43| I would probably lean towards wanting to remove that rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12883)|
| 3:34:48| for all races, but I can see it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12888)|
| 3:34:54| Because when we've had less competitive races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12894)|
| 3:34:59| it doesn't make sense, even like in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12899)|
| 3:35:02| it doesn't make sense for a race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12902)|
| 3:35:10| to continue on to the general when there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12910)|
| 3:35:19| the mayor and judge have been resolved by the same voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12919)|
| 3:35:24| Who are being asked to resolve the next race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12924)|
| 3:35:26| Do you know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12926)|
| 3:35:27| In the district races, I was proposing district only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12927)|
| 3:35:32| So those would be a different set of voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12932)|
| 3:35:35| than the full citywide voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12935)|
| 3:35:38| who are voting for at-large mayor and judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12938)|
| 3:35:43| Okay, I follow you on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12943)|
| 3:35:45| And so I think what I hear you say is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| you wanna propose this as a standalone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12947)|
| 3:35:50| whether if council member Roberto's gets passed on a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12950)|
| 3:35:57| you want this to still be a standalone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12957)|
| 3:35:58| that could be on the ballot to accompany| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12958)|
| 3:36:00| what the state law is now, which would be district only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12960)|
| 3:36:04| So either way, whichever it shakes out with the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12964)|
| 3:36:07| this would be standalone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| Yes, and for me, I think it would be more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12969)|
| 3:36:15| for voters if we are saying to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12975)|
| 3:36:18| you make the choice at the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12978)|
| 3:36:23| to either take us to an at-large system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| or a district only system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12985)|
| 3:36:28| If we take the language out about the district only system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12988)|
| 3:36:34| it will not conflict with Roberto's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12994)|
| 3:36:37| So either can be chosen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=12997)|
| 3:36:40| but it would still take us to a district only system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13000)|
| 3:36:44| if voters do not select Roberto's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13008)|
| 3:37:06| Council, we need to, yes, council member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13026)|
| 3:37:10| I'd like if we could take a little bit of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13030)|
| 3:37:13| for the attorneys to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13033)|
| 3:37:16| and parse that in a way, but we don't even have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13036)|
| 3:37:20| But what we have Ms. Parker's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13040)|
| 3:37:22| I guess, to approve it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13042)|
| 3:37:27| So is it a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13047)|
| 3:37:28| We need a motion and a second on the original proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13048)|
| 3:37:31| in order to make an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| So. Or is it a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13053)|
| 3:37:37| We have an original motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13057)|
| 3:37:39| So Councilman Parker, you've made the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| on the original amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13061)|
| 3:37:44| Excuse me, the original ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13064)|
| 3:37:46| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13066)|
| 3:37:47| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13067)|
| 3:37:48| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13068)|
| 3:37:49| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13069)|
| 3:37:50| Seconded by Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13070)|
| 3:37:51| Now we can introduce the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13071)|
| 3:37:55| unless Councilwoman Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13075)|
| 3:37:56| do you still want the attorneys to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13076)|
| 3:38:00| Okay, Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13080)|
| 3:38:02| would you please readdress the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13082)|
| 3:38:04| that you're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13084)|
| 3:38:07| Okay, so the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13087)|
| 3:38:10| do you want me to read what the language would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13090)|
| 3:38:14| if the other language is removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13097)|
| 3:38:18| Shall article seven, section 707| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13098)|
| 3:38:21| of the charter of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| entitled manner of holding elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13103)|
| 3:38:27| be amended so as to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13107)|
| 3:38:31| that at-large candidates may be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13111)|
| 3:38:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| So as to establish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| Okay, I gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| And then I would read the rest of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| So as to establish that at-large candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13125)|
| 3:38:48| may be elected in the, okay, I gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13128)|
| 3:38:53| And that's the one change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| striking those four and a half lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13135)|
| 3:38:59| Yes, and I can make an edit also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13139)|
| 3:39:03| to the text in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13143)|
| 3:39:06| but that text might conflict with Roberto's text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13146)|
| 3:39:33| Can I just ask a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13173)|
| 3:39:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13175)|
| 3:39:36| What page are we talking about on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13176)|
| 3:39:39| Because 850 on mine is not any of this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13179)|
| 3:39:43| So I'm trying to follow along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13183)|
| 3:39:45| and I'm not sure where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13185)|
| 3:39:46| Are we in the language that's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13186)|
| 3:39:50| Okay, so if we change the language in the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13190)|
| 3:39:54| do we not also have to change the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13194)|
| 3:39:56| in the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13196)|
| 3:39:58| Okay, okay, I'm just making sure I'm following it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13198)|
| 3:40:00| So we're actually on page 849,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13200)|
| 3:40:03| if we're doing the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13203)|
| 3:40:06| All the way to the top, it says 850, it switches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13206)|
| 3:40:09| So like if any part of it, page 849,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| shows on your screen, it says 849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13211)|
| 3:40:14| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13214)|
| 3:40:16| Now I'm following you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13216)|
| 3:40:17| All right, Council Member Parker, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13217)|
| 3:40:20| I was trying to figure out where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13220)|
| 3:40:23| Could you read what your changes were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13223)|
| 3:40:25| I guess you're in that second paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13225)|
| 3:40:27| where it says shall article seven, section 707.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13227)|
| 3:40:31| Okay, where are we there so I can follow along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13231)|
| 3:40:36| Um, section 707 of the Charter of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13236)|
| 3:40:40| entitled Manner of Holding Elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13240)|
| 3:40:42| be amended so as to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13242)|
| 3:40:45| and then I dropped down about four sentences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13245)|
| 3:40:48| four lines to establish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13248)|
| 3:40:53| Be amended so as to establish that at-large candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13253)|
| 3:40:57| may be elected in the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13257)|
| 3:40:58| with the majority of the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13258)|
| 3:41:00| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13260)|
| 3:41:10| So if, just talking about that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13270)|
| 3:41:15| so if Council Member Roberto's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13275)|
| 3:41:18| passes on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13278)|
| 3:41:20| and this one passes on first and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13280)|
| 3:41:25| I mean, it's a little redundant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13285)|
| 3:41:29| because you're both saying at-large candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| elected with 50% plus one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13291)|
| 3:41:35| The original, yeah, I think 12B had that in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13295)|
| 3:41:39| so I don't, it's a little redundant, but it is a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13299)|
| 3:41:43| This would allow for two options, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13303)|
| 3:41:46| So if you want the at-large system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13306)|
| 3:41:51| you vote for Roberto's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| and that gives you the at-large system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13313)|
| 3:41:55| and the 50% plus one for at-large races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13315)|
| 3:42:03| But if you want the district-only option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13323)|
| 3:42:08| if we don't include this in my ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13328)|
| 3:42:12| that will not be adopted after the vote in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13332)|
| 3:42:18| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13338)|
| 3:42:20| Yes, yes, it does to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13340)|
| 3:42:23| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13343)|
| 3:42:24| I understand exactly what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13344)|
| 3:42:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13346)|
| 3:42:30| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13350)|
| 3:42:31| Yeah, go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13351)|
| 3:42:32| So I think what Council Member Parker is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13352)|
| 3:42:36| because this body has talked about it numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13356)|
| 3:42:39| that the three at-large seats cannot win in the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13359)|
| 3:42:47| regardless of how we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13367)|
| 3:42:48| we cannot win in the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13368)|
| 3:42:51| like the mayor and the judge can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13371)|
| 3:42:54| So I believe what this ordinance is becoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13374)|
| 3:42:57| and if I'm speaking, I'm sure I'll be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13377)|
| 3:43:00| but the way I'm interpreting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13380)|
| 3:43:02| is that this is an ordinance that just deals with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13382)|
| 3:43:06| city council at-large being able to win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13386)|
| 3:43:11| with 50% plus one, just like the mayor and the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13391)|
| 3:43:15| and it deals with how you settle a tie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13395)|
| 3:43:20| so that in the event, if the other proposal does not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13400)|
| 3:43:26| we do not have to wait another two or more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13406)|
| 3:43:30| to settle the city council at-large question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13410)|
| 3:43:34| which has been talked about for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13414)|
| 3:43:39| So I think that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13419)|
| 3:43:40| so I understand how y'all can think it's in conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13420)|
| 3:43:44| and I get that it might be in conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13424)|
| 3:43:46| but I think it's an opportunity to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13426)|
| 3:43:49| fixing like Councilman Thomas is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13429)|
| 3:43:57| that if the other doesn't fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| then we move to where the fifth district votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13439)|
| 3:44:06| I mean, it comes up on the election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13446)|
| 3:44:08| That's kind of what I think I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13448)|
| 3:44:10| And again, it's late, we haven't even had a recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13450)|
| 3:44:13| so I might be confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| but I think that's what you were going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13457)|
| 3:44:21| No, I don't think it was perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13461)|
| 3:44:23| Councilman Parker, do you have anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13463)|
| 3:44:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13465)|
| 3:44:26| I have a question about the item around the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13466)|
| 3:44:30| It's my understanding that, according to your proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13470)|
| 3:44:32| that if there's a tie between first and second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13472)|
| 3:44:38| yeah, if there's a tie between first and second places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13478)|
| 3:44:48| that the third place would come along too, to the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13488)|
| 3:44:58| If there's a tie between first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13498)|
| 3:45:00| I guess what I'm saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13500)|
| 3:45:01| if there's a tie between first and second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13501)|
| 3:45:05| or second and third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13505)|
| 3:45:07| because you're talking about top two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13507)|
| 3:45:09| so you could have scenario one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13509)|
| 3:45:13| candidate A gets 100, candidate B gets 100 votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13513)|
| 3:45:16| and candidate C gets 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13516)|
| 3:45:18| In that scenario, all three go to the runoff, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13518)|
| 3:45:21| Similarly, if candidate A gets 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13521)|
| 3:45:25| and candidate B gets 50, and candidate C gets 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13525)|
| 3:45:29| all three go forward again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| because there's a tie, and it's the top two vote counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13531)|
| 3:45:36| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13536)|
| 3:45:37| So you could potentially have two different outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13537)|
| 3:45:39| or two different tie for first and second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| or tie between second and third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| but in both scenarios, all three candidates would go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| Am I understanding that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13545)|
| 3:45:49| Yes, into the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13549)|
| 3:45:50| Yeah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13550)|
| 3:45:52| I believe so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13552)|
| 3:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| Councilwoman Halsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13556)|
| 3:45:57| First and second, so you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13557)|
| 3:45:59| you're going to drag a third person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13559)|
| 3:46:00| that only got 50 votes into a runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13560)|
| 3:46:03| with two that got 100 a piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13563)|
| 3:46:05| Is that what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| Do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13567)|
| 3:46:08| The top two vote totals would go on to the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13568)|
| 3:46:11| The top two vote totals would be the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13571)|
| 3:46:12| that tied at 100, not the one that's down here at 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13572)|
| 3:46:16| No, it would be-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13576)|
| 3:46:17| That's what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13577)|
| 3:46:20| 100 is one vote total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13580)|
| 3:46:23| 50 is another vote total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| If multiple people get the same vote total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13585)|
| 3:46:29| that's still one vote total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13591)|
| 3:46:32| I mean, I get it, but I don't know why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13592)|
| 3:46:35| I don't understand how that would be equitable to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13595)|
| 3:46:40| I get the one about the second place tie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13600)|
| 3:46:43| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13603)|
| 3:46:44| But the first place tie and then dragging somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13604)|
| 3:46:48| I mean, I don't really care, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13608)|
| 3:46:49| but it seems weird or different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13609)|
| 3:46:53| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13613)|
| 3:46:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13614)|
| 3:46:55| If we go forward with three people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13615)|
| 3:46:58| is when you go to the general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13618)|
| 3:47:03| does there have to be a 51%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13623)|
| 3:47:06| or do they win with a plurality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13626)|
| 3:47:14| Well, we would look to our charter for that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13634)|
| 3:47:18| I'm not changing any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13638)|
| 3:47:20| I haven't researched it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13640)|
| 3:47:20| so I don't know what our charter says, to tell you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13640)|
| 3:47:23| I don't know what the exact language says either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| but I imagine they win with the majority of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13645)|
| 3:47:28| All I'm trying to do is make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13648)|
| 3:47:31| that there is some way that we resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13651)|
| 3:47:34| whether it gets finalized by a plurality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13654)|
| 3:47:38| or whether that person's got to have a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13658)|
| 3:47:40| which will then, if they've got to have a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13660)|
| 3:47:44| then you got to have one more vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13664)|
| 3:47:47| I believe that our charter says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13667)|
| 3:47:49| they have to have a majority of the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13669)|
| 3:47:53| but we could double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13673)|
| 3:47:56| All right, we have an amendment on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13676)|
| 3:47:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13678)|
| 3:47:59| Do we have a second on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13679)|
| 3:48:02| We have a motion on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13682)|
| 3:48:03| Is there a second on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13683)|
| 3:48:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13685)|
| 3:48:08| Councilman McKenzie seconded, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13688)|
| 3:48:13| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13693)|
| 3:48:16| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13696)|
| 3:48:19| I think that I understand what Councilmember Parker's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13699)|
| 3:48:23| and the issues with district-only races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13703)|
| 3:48:29| if you strike all of what you talked about striking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13709)|
| 3:48:33| would not be there for me anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13713)|
| 3:48:36| So that's a big improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13716)|
| 3:48:38| because going from getting to vote for nine people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13718)|
| 3:48:40| down to four, I just can't vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13720)|
| 3:48:43| So if that's struck, then I can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13723)|
| 3:48:47| where you're trying to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13727)|
| 3:48:48| and you're trying to address the tie situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13728)|
| 3:48:53| I guess the thing that I really have concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13733)|
| 3:48:56| is we're talking about doing a charter change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13736)|
| 3:48:59| and we're making changes to something on the fly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13739)|
| 3:49:02| and we just got a discussion about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13742)|
| 3:49:04| hey, let's maybe take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13744)|
| 3:49:06| I don't know that I'm comfortable doing it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13746)|
| 3:49:09| I don't know why we don't, we've got time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13749)|
| 3:49:11| Why don't we postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13751)|
| 3:49:13| and then have the attorneys get by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13753)|
| 3:49:16| and it gives Councilmember Parker a fair amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13756)|
| 3:49:18| to make the amendments and then publicize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13758)|
| 3:49:21| because nobody has seen what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13761)|
| 3:49:24| It's one thing when we're making something on the fly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13764)|
| 3:49:27| that isn't going to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13767)|
| 3:49:29| I just have a hard time being comfortable doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13769)|
| 3:49:31| and there is time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| There is time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13773)|
| 3:49:34| We can postpone it for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13774)|
| 3:49:35| and come back and get reorganized and look at it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13775)|
| 3:49:38| That's my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13778)|
| 3:49:42| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13782)|
| 3:49:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13783)|
| 3:49:45| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13785)|
| 3:49:46| So I looked in the charter under sections for district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13786)|
| 3:49:49| and at-large members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13789)|
| 3:49:51| It says the candidate from each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13791)|
| 3:49:53| receiving the most votes shall be declared elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13793)|
| 3:50:14| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13814)|
| 3:50:17| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13817)|
| 3:50:19| So page 850 has the section, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13819)|
| 3:50:27| Page 850 has the section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13827)|
| 3:50:30| that just got offered up for an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13830)|
| 3:50:34| and that pertains to the 50% majority for at-large seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13834)|
| 3:50:41| Where is the language, what page is it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13841)|
| 3:50:44| that would appear on the ballot about the runoff for ties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13844)|
| 3:50:52| The bottom in that paragraph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13852)|
| 3:50:55| Oh, okay, it's in the same paragraph, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13855)|
| 3:50:58| The part the candidate's receiving the two highest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13858)|
| 3:51:00| Okay, I guess I'm with Councilwoman Helsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13860)|
| 3:51:04| I don't understand if you have two candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13864)|
| 3:51:09| if you have however number of candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| on the ballot in the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13871)|
| 3:51:13| and the first place gets 100 votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| and second place gets 100 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13875)|
| 3:51:16| I don't understand why you'd send,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13876)|
| 3:51:19| I do like the word drag and I'm sorry that I laughed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13879)|
| 3:51:22| That's hilarious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13882)|
| 3:51:24| I pull along, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13884)|
| 3:51:26| I don't understand why third goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13886)|
| 3:51:29| because 100 votes, 100 votes, the general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13889)|
| 3:51:33| that is the point of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13893)|
| 3:51:34| is to break the tie between those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13894)|
| 3:51:37| And Councilwoman Parker, you brought this forward in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13897)|
| 3:51:42| I believe, and that was the issue that we came up with then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13902)|
| 3:51:46| and that's why it didn't get put on the ballot then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13906)|
| 3:51:49| And so now we're looking at the same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13909)|
| 3:51:52| Is it the same language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13912)|
| 3:51:57| I don't remember that issue being brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13917)|
| 3:51:59| Can you remind me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13919)|
| 3:52:03| Well, because there was confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13923)|
| 3:52:05| as to who all would go on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13925)|
| 3:52:07| and so there was conversation about vetting it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13927)|
| 3:52:10| So neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13930)|
| 3:52:13| I have no problem with the voters deciding a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13933)|
| 3:52:17| There was nothing fun about the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13937)|
| 3:52:18| that happened last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13938)|
| 3:52:24| And so I just don't, a tie for first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13944)|
| 3:52:28| is the top two vote getters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13948)|
| 3:52:30| and so my thing would be the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13950)|
| 3:52:33| just needs to be cleared up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13953)|
| 3:52:35| that if it's a tie that makes it unclear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13955)|
| 3:52:40| of who the two top two vote getters are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13960)|
| 3:52:42| that you don't need to send three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13962)|
| 3:52:44| one first and second tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13964)|
| 3:52:49| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13969)|
| 3:52:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| I'm not feeling ready to vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| because it feels like we're still trying to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13976)|
| 3:53:00| I have no problems with looking at it again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13980)|
| 3:53:04| But where are we in procedure right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13984)|
| 3:53:07| I don't think there's been an official motion to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| but right now we have a first and second on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13989)|
| 3:53:19| We don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=13999)|
| 3:53:20| If someone wants to make a motion to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14000)|
| 3:53:22| it supersedes the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14002)|
| 3:53:28| Okay, we have a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14008)|
| 3:53:31| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| Any discussion on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14013)|
| 3:53:38| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14018)|
| 3:53:43| You know, part of me doesn't mind postponing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14023)|
| 3:53:46| but part of me is concerned that this is just political games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14026)|
| 3:53:53| and that concerns me because we were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14033)|
| 3:53:55| to amend Charlie's ordinance just a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14035)|
| 3:53:59| and that wasn't an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14039)|
| 3:54:01| And there are other parts of that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14041)|
| 3:54:04| that I have concerns about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14044)|
| 3:54:05| but I tried to be a good team player and I didn't complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14045)|
| 3:54:09| Now we're being nitpicky with mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14049)|
| 3:54:11| and this language has been before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14051)|
| 3:54:14| for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14054)|
| 3:54:16| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14056)|
| 3:54:18| Yes, well, I'm not playing a political game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14058)|
| 3:54:20| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14060)|
| 3:54:21| And a lot of what I hear appeals to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14061)|
| 3:54:25| Councilperson Fugate's kind of issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14065)|
| 3:54:28| that she's been kind of trying to bring forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14068)|
| 3:54:31| for a long time I thought is very well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14071)|
| 3:54:34| It just doesn't make sense, the 50% for the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14074)|
| 3:54:38| and not for the, it's illogical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14078)|
| 3:54:41| like I would say my fifth district issue is too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14081)|
| 3:54:44| And we've been needed to clean that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14084)|
| 3:54:47| and I'm for cleaning that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14087)|
| 3:54:49| The issue about the top vote getters, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14089)|
| 3:54:53| going on to the general, yeah, I get that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14093)|
| 3:54:55| I do have some of the same concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14095)|
| 3:54:58| that Councilperson Halesley did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14098)|
| 3:55:00| and Councilperson Ryder did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14100)|
| 3:55:01| is I understand sending the top two on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14101)|
| 3:55:06| or if there's a tie for the bottom slot, I get that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14106)|
| 3:55:11| But if there's a tie for the top two slots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14111)|
| 3:55:15| I don't get sending the third vote getter onto the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14115)|
| 3:55:20| But anyway, that's what we need to talk about, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14120)|
| 3:55:23| And there's just questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14123)|
| 3:55:25| I'd like to get this vetted through the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14125)|
| 3:55:27| and make sure we've got something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14127)|
| 3:55:28| that the law department feels comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14128)|
| 3:55:32| I'm not in opposition to either one of these ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14132)|
| 3:55:35| I just, my position is I would feel more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14135)|
| 3:55:39| if we did take a little bit more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14139)|
| 3:55:41| and got it vetted through the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14141)|
| 3:55:43| and we really got the language cleaned up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14143)|
| 3:55:45| the way we wanted to present it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14145)|
| 3:55:47| And we can still do it on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14147)|
| 3:55:49| but that's just my perspective on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14149)|
| 3:55:54| And I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14154)|
| 3:55:58| And I'm sorry, you haven't called on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14158)|
| 3:56:00| Councilwoman Barker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14160)|
| 3:56:01| Thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14161)|
| 3:56:04| I mean, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14164)|
| 3:56:05| I wanna forward you the whole email conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14165)|
| 3:56:08| because I was in conversation with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14168)|
| 3:56:11| two years ago over this for like a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14171)|
| 3:56:14| Longer than this process has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14174)|
| 3:56:17| for these other charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| It has been thoroughly vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14179)|
| 3:56:23| I apologize that there are questions being raised right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14183)|
| 3:56:27| that you do not have adequate answers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14187)|
| 3:56:31| And I hope that everyone is being sincere currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14191)|
| 3:56:36| And if so, then I definitely support a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14196)|
| 3:56:40| so that we can clear up this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14200)|
| 3:56:44| But in my view, it's just one line to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14204)|
| 3:56:51| to clean this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| And so that's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14213)|
| 3:56:56| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14216)|
| 3:56:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14218)|
| 3:56:59| I wasn't sure where Charlie was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14219)|
| 3:57:02| I'm getting really tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14222)|
| 3:57:05| I wasn't sure if you were saying you'd rather not postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14225)|
| 3:57:08| I'm very comfortable pulling my postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14228)|
| 3:57:10| and voting on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14230)|
| 3:57:13| I was inclined to postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14233)|
| 3:57:15| for the reasons you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14235)|
| 3:57:17| And then I kind of added that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14237)|
| 3:57:19| which you may have kind of lost me there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| because we're all tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14241)|
| 3:57:22| But I was saying I've got a lot of camaraderie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14242)|
| 3:57:26| with Councilperson Fugate's idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14246)|
| 3:57:28| about making the 50% thing across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14248)|
| 3:57:33| And then the idea that Councilperson Parker has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14253)|
| 3:57:37| about the runoff election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14257)|
| 3:57:40| I'm sympathetic to both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14260)|
| 3:57:43| So this is not in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14263)|
| 3:57:44| I just wonder if we might need a little bit more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14264)|
| 3:57:49| to get it vetted and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14269)|
| 3:57:51| If my council people disagree with me, that's okay too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14271)|
| 3:57:55| But I guess I'm inclined to take a little bit more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14275)|
| 3:57:59| and just make sure we get it clean and packaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14279)|
| 3:58:04| before in two weeks and we can do it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14284)|
| 3:58:08| But I'm open to other ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14288)|
| 3:58:12| So which way are you landing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14292)|
| 3:58:14| I prefer to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14294)|
| 3:58:18| And I seconded your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14298)|
| 3:58:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| Any other discussion on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14303)|
| 3:58:25| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14305)|
| 3:58:26| Yeah, I just wanted to say I sincerely support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14306)|
| 3:58:29| sending something to the voters to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14309)|
| 3:58:32| about tie breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14312)|
| 3:58:34| I'm very sincere about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14314)|
| 3:58:36| I'm not playing political games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14316)|
| 3:58:38| I just want language that clarifies first and second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14318)|
| 3:58:40| being tied for first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14320)|
| 3:58:42| Thank you for letting me clarify what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14322)|
| 3:58:44| I support you in that and I will support the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14324)|
| 3:58:47| to get the language correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14327)|
| 3:58:50| Any other discussion around the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14330)|
| 3:58:52| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14332)|

| 3:59:53| of the item and one to speak opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14393)|
| 3:59:55| First up is Benjamin Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14395)|
| 3:59:57| Mr. Mullins, please state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14397)|
| 3:59:58| for the record and you'll have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14398)|
| 4:00:00| to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14400)|
| 4:00:02| Thank you, Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14402)|
| 4:00:03| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14403)|
| 4:00:06| I'd like to thank everybody for their patience tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14406)|
| 4:00:07| and waiting on us to get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14407)|
| 4:00:08| and especially the audience behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14408)|
| 4:00:11| I know they're not here in favor of what I'm asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14411)|
| 4:00:14| but I do appreciate that they're here and have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14414)|
| 4:00:17| and have waited this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14417)|
| 4:00:20| This property is, by raw acreage, 15 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14420)|
| 4:00:26| but if you look at what the actual envelope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14426)|
| 4:00:29| of development potential is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14429)|
| 4:00:31| it's actually significantly smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14431)|
| 4:00:34| There's only about five acres that's above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14434)|
| 4:00:36| the summer pool level of the Tennessee River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14436)|
| 4:00:38| State 13 contour line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14438)|
| 4:00:41| The TVA flow has been actually extends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14441)|
| 4:00:42| the 822 contour line, and there's a 60-foot riparian buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14442)|
| 4:00:47| that is actually measured from the summer pool level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14447)|
| 4:00:50| Then you also have the 100-year floodway zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14450)|
| 4:00:52| and the 500-year floodway zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14452)|
| 4:00:54| and all of those things really restrict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14454)|
| 4:00:57| what can be developed without going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14457)|
| 4:00:59| extraordinary efforts to get special permissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| through different organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14461)|
| 4:01:04| Knox County, the City of Knoxville Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14464)|
| 4:01:07| and TVA, and TDEC, and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14467)|
| 4:01:11| So the actual development acreage of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14471)|
| 4:01:14| is about 1.7 acres, and that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14474)|
| 4:01:19| because I've looked at their website in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14479)|
| 4:01:22| I've seen the templates of emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14482)|
| 4:01:24| I'm sure there's three different templates that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14484)|
| 4:01:26| and all of them mention that there's 72 townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14486)|
| 4:01:31| can go on here, and that's just not accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14491)|
| 4:01:32| and I want to make sure I redispel that right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14492)|
| 4:01:37| The city, the density is really a function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| of the dimensional design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14499)|
| 4:01:42| and other environmental constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14502)|
| 4:01:43| and so what we're looking at is about 1.7 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14503)|
| 4:01:46| that could reasonably be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14506)|
| 4:01:50| The request, there's three requests here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14510)|
| 4:01:51| and they're hard to divorce the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| from the sector plan and the one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14513)|
| 4:01:56| The reason we are asking for the sector plan to MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14516)|
| 4:01:59| is it's the only sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14519)|
| 4:02:01| that would allow the RN3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14521)|
| 4:02:04| The RN3 zoning is requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14524)|
| 4:02:07| not to try to increase any density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14527)|
| 4:02:09| but to allow different housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14529)|
| 4:02:10| RN3 is the first zone that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14530)|
| 4:02:14| there to be a townhome development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14534)|
| 4:02:16| and given the location of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14536)|
| 4:02:19| it's kind of out on an island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14539)|
| 4:02:21| It's on really a peninsula in the city on Lion's Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14541)|
| 4:02:24| It's the last piece of zoning in the city on Lion's Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14544)|
| 4:02:27| Everything south and west of there is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14547)|
| 4:02:31| It's right across the cove from Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14551)|
| 4:02:34| It's 185 feet to a RN5 zoning development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14554)|
| 4:02:40| the Westchase condominiums there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14560)|
| 4:02:44| across South North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14564)|
| 4:02:47| so we think this is kind of a unique opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14567)|
| 4:02:50| to kind of create a pocket townhome development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14570)|
| 4:02:53| in close proximity to Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14573)|
| 4:02:56| Justifications for the plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14576)|
| 4:02:59| you know, there's essentially three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14579)|
| 4:03:02| The changing conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14582)|
| 4:03:03| well, we know that Knoxville is facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14583)|
| 4:03:05| an unprecedented housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14585)|
| 4:03:07| an influx of population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14587)|
| 4:03:08| We just crossed, you know, Knox County as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14588)|
| 4:03:11| just crossed 500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14591)|
| 4:03:13| The population counted 500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14593)|
| 4:03:16| for the first time that we know of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14596)|
| 4:03:19| and so there is a need for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| and we know this city council has prioritized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14601)|
| 4:03:24| trying to diversify different housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14604)|
| 4:03:27| and allowing townhomes and that middle form housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14607)|
| 4:03:31| speaks to that policy that this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14611)|
| 4:03:33| has been trying to prioritize and encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14613)|
| 4:03:36| for the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14616)|
| 4:03:39| Also, and this was not addressed in staff's report per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14619)|
| 4:03:42| but there has been a reinvestment in Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14622)|
| 4:03:45| I mean, a multi-million dollar investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14625)|
| 4:03:48| in Lakeshore Park, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14628)|
| 4:03:50| really has reinvested and reinvigorated that Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14630)|
| 4:03:55| which is a crown jewel park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14635)|
| 4:03:57| It's for both the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14637)|
| 4:03:59| and having an ability for maybe a different housing type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14639)|
| 4:04:04| not everybody wants to live on a 10,000 square foot lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14644)|
| 4:04:07| and maintain a yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14647)|
| 4:04:08| Some people would like to live close to amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14648)|
| 4:04:10| such as a park like Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14650)|
| 4:04:12| and, you know, live in attached housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14652)|
| 4:04:15| live in a townhome community that is smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14655)|
| 4:04:18| and easier to maintain and be a five minute drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14658)|
| 4:04:22| from Lakeshore Park instead of a 30 minute drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14662)|
| 4:04:24| and so those reasons we think this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14664)|
| 4:04:28| is unique in its consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14668)|
| 4:04:30| and appropriate for the RN3 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14670)|
| 4:04:33| especially considering that the closest residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14673)|
| 4:04:37| in the city to this property is RN5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14677)|
| 4:04:40| and already attached housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14680)|
| 4:04:42| so there's very much some similarities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14682)|
| 4:04:46| We did try to work with the neighborhood on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14686)|
| 4:04:49| and I know they have sincere concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14689)|
| 4:04:53| but we think that this is more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14693)|
| 4:04:56| because it is such a small development potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14696)|
| 4:04:59| We're not talking about 72 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14699)|
| 4:05:01| We're talking about at most 10 to 20 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14701)|
| 4:05:04| and I really doubt with the environmental constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14704)|
| 4:05:06| we can even get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14706)|
| 4:05:08| This is a special, if RN3 is a special use application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14708)|
| 4:05:12| which means if it is approved and we do do townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14712)|
| 4:05:15| that would go back to Planning Commission for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14715)|
| 4:05:18| as to that specific plan and any environmental concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14718)|
| 4:05:21| and it could potentially come here to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14721)|
| 4:05:23| if that's on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14723)|
| 4:05:25| so there'd be a chance to look at this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14725)|
| 4:05:27| The zoning doesn't add any traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14727)|
| 4:05:29| It doesn't create any environmental concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14729)|
| 4:05:31| It just gives us permission to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14731)|
| 4:05:33| and try to plan for something that would be intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14733)|
| 4:05:36| Thank you, Mr. Melvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14736)|
| 4:05:37| Appreciate your time, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14737)|
| 4:05:38| Next up is Logan Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14738)|
| 4:05:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14740)|
| 4:05:50| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14750)|
| 4:05:51| Logan Higgins, 133 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14751)|
| 4:05:55| So as most of y'all probably know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14755)|
| 4:05:58| I'm on Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14758)|
| 4:05:59| I don't come here tonight as a Planning Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14759)|
| 4:06:04| I'm a licensed architect and work mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14764)|
| 4:06:07| in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14767)|
| 4:06:08| and the reason I'm here is the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14768)|
| 4:06:13| just this week, Scott called and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14773)|
| 4:06:16| that he had been working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14776)|
| 4:06:19| and people had been asking how many units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14779)|
| 4:06:21| he would be putting on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14781)|
| 4:06:23| and his answer has been he doesn't know how many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14783)|
| 4:06:27| or I guess how many units he could put here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14787)|
| 4:06:29| and he doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14789)|
| 4:06:30| He had no idea, so he was calling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14790)|
| 4:06:33| because he knows that I know the city zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14793)|
| 4:06:38| very well inside and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14798)|
| 4:06:40| and could probably speak to how many units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14800)|
| 4:06:44| he could put and give him an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14804)|
| 4:06:45| that he could use to communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14805)|
| 4:06:47| but what that conversation turned into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14807)|
| 4:06:50| was me explaining all of the hurdles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14810)|
| 4:06:54| that he's gonna have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14814)|
| 4:06:56| to actually do the project here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14816)|
| 4:06:59| and all the ways that this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14819)|
| 4:07:02| will naturally limit the possible density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14822)|
| 4:07:06| and so after that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14826)|
| 4:07:09| and I'll get into some of that in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14829)|
| 4:07:11| but just from that quick phone call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14831)|
| 4:07:14| I offered to come and speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14834)|
| 4:07:19| I had no idea what I was getting myself into tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14839)|
| 4:07:22| but it's been very exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14842)|
| 4:07:25| to watch everything that's gone on tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14845)|
| 4:07:28| but specifically talking about this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14848)|
| 4:07:31| and why I think that it really makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14851)|
| 4:07:36| to approve not only the, well, all three requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14856)|
| 4:07:41| and those lead up to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14861)|
| 4:07:46| When doing townhouses, he's gonna have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14866)|
| 4:07:50| like Ben mentioned, cluster everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14870)|
| 4:07:52| There's going to be parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14872)|
| 4:07:55| With townhouses, parking lots are gonna have to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14875)|
| 4:07:59| 25 feet at least from the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14879)|
| 4:08:03| and that's not even just the front setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14883)|
| 4:08:05| That's just how far parking lots have to be set back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14885)|
| 4:08:09| from the front property line in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14889)|
| 4:08:12| From there, he could have the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14892)|
| 4:08:14| but he's still gonna have rear setbacks on parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14894)|
| 4:08:18| There's very small slither of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14898)|
| 4:08:20| that's actually buildable on this because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14900)|
| 4:08:26| Those setbacks would end up putting everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14906)|
| 4:08:29| into the floodway way too far into the floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14909)|
| 4:08:32| if he tried to max this out with townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14912)|
| 4:08:37| There's also requirements with townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14917)|
| 4:08:39| for not only the square footage density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14919)|
| 4:08:42| but also the lot width requirements per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14922)|
| 4:08:48| And then I also mentioned to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14928)|
| 4:08:50| you're going to have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14930)|
| 4:08:53| for a use on review with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14933)|
| 4:08:55| so whatever you do end up designing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14935)|
| 4:08:59| whenever you get to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14939)|
| 4:09:01| is still going to have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14941)|
| 4:09:02| through the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14942)|
| 4:09:06| So I do think that there's a lot of restrictions in play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14946)|
| 4:09:10| and with zoning, it's supposed to be a consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14950)|
| 4:09:15| of the site and the context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14955)|
| 4:09:17| and does this make sense here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14957)|
| 4:09:18| I think it absolutely does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14958)|
| 4:09:19| being on a major road and near a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14959)|
| 4:09:23| But I'll say also that as it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14963)|
| 4:09:28| if he were to take it and subdivide it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14968)|
| 4:09:32| to do single family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14972)|
| 4:09:35| the size of what's there would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14975)|
| 4:09:37| for about 70 single houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14977)|
| 4:09:41| If they were to just chop it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14981)|
| 4:09:43| and do flag lots, it could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14983)|
| 4:09:46| That's 70 driveways potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14986)|
| 4:09:49| that could be hitting that road as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14989)|
| 4:09:52| Current zoning, just current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14992)|
| 4:09:58| With townhouses, they're not going to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=14998)|
| 4:10:01| They can't parcel off for townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15001)|
| 4:10:03| because townhouses have to be at least a group of three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15003)|
| 4:10:06| and it wouldn't really make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15006)|
| 4:10:07| with the setbacks to continue to parcel off more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15007)|
| 4:10:09| So it will stay all one parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15009)|
| 4:10:11| and have one central driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15011)|
| 4:10:14| that everything would access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15014)|
| 4:10:18| So I say that to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15018)|
| 4:10:20| I do think that doing townhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15020)|
| 4:10:22| they're going to be actually fewer units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15022)|
| 4:10:25| than what they could potentially theoretically do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15025)|
| 4:10:27| under the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15027)|
| 4:10:29| It will just allow for a much more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15029)|
| 4:10:32| and effective layout and use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15032)|
| 4:10:35| So that's why I volunteered to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15035)|
| 4:10:38| and speak in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15038)|
| 4:10:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15040)|
| 4:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15041)|
| 4:10:42| Next up is Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15042)|
| 4:10:44| Scott Smith, 1476 Linesman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15044)|
| 4:10:47| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15047)|
| 4:10:48| It's been a long night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15048)|
| 4:10:50| I just want to emphasize a couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15050)|
| 4:10:54| I think we can do an incredibly nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15054)|
| 4:10:56| high quality development here, very small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15056)|
| 4:10:59| limited to no more than 20 units of townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15059)|
| 4:11:04| This property is one mile from Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15064)|
| 4:11:07| 700 feet from North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15067)|
| 4:11:09| and has a beautiful, beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15069)|
| 4:11:12| and has a beautiful cove that surrounds this peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15072)|
| 4:11:17| I would commit that if we were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15077)|
| 4:11:19| we'll work with staff and the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15079)|
| 4:11:21| We'll come up with a plan that everybody's satisfied with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15081)|
| 4:11:24| and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15084)|
| 4:11:27| I'll be reserved the rest of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15087)|
| 4:11:28| in case there's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15088)|
| 4:11:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15090)|
| 4:11:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15091)|
| 4:11:32| One person has signed up to speak in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15092)|
| 4:11:34| Wayne Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15094)|
| 4:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15097)|
| 4:11:38| We lost a lot of our folks tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15098)|
| 4:11:41| particularly the older ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15101)|
| 4:11:42| but those who came in opposition, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15102)|
| 4:11:46| My name is Wayne Klein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15106)|
| 4:11:48| attorney at the law firm of Hodges, Dowdy, and Carson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15108)|
| 4:11:51| 445 South Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15111)|
| 4:11:53| here on behalf of Westminster Ridge Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15113)|
| 4:11:57| and a lot of the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15117)|
| 4:11:59| out on the Lions Bend Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15119)|
| 4:12:04| I have to vehemently disagree with Mr. Logan Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15124)|
| 4:12:08| about the number of units out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15128)|
| 4:12:11| but what you're really gonna vote on tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15131)|
| 4:12:15| is whether you're gonna change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15135)|
| 4:12:18| you're gonna have a one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15138)|
| 4:12:20| and you're gonna rezone to a medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15140)|
| 4:12:23| It's not about townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15143)|
| 4:12:25| It's about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15145)|
| 4:12:26| You all know that once it's rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15146)|
| 4:12:29| Mr. Smith can do whatever he wants with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15149)|
| 4:12:31| He can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15151)|
| 4:12:31| Somebody can come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15151)|
| 4:12:32| and then they have a medium density to develop in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15152)|
| 4:12:38| In this case, the applicant's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15158)|
| 4:12:41| is at the mouth of where the Fourth Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15161)|
| 4:12:43| enters the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15163)|
| 4:12:45| Much of the 15 total acres Mr. Smith's proposing to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15165)|
| 4:12:52| is in a floodway or a flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15172)|
| 4:12:54| It's shown in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15174)|
| 4:12:57| Only approximately two to five acres is developable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15177)|
| 4:13:01| and the environmental consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15181)|
| 4:13:03| of rezoning the entire 15 acre parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15183)|
| 4:13:06| to medium density residential or RN3 are obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15186)|
| 4:13:11| Pollution and runoff into the Tennessee River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15191)|
| 4:13:13| would have a significant detrimental impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15193)|
| 4:13:17| to the downstream neighbors and the peninsula as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15197)|
| 4:13:21| The West City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15201)|
| 4:13:24| includes a substantial portion of Fourth Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15204)|
| 4:13:26| which flows through and constitutes much of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15206)|
| 4:13:30| In the hydrology section of the West City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15210)|
| 4:13:34| Fourth Creek is identified as the most prone to flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15214)|
| 4:13:38| as it drains a large portion of the center of the sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15218)|
| 4:13:41| the West City Sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15221)|
| 4:13:43| Those conditions do not support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| denser residential development at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15225)|

| 4:13:54| While I'm referencing location and classification criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15234)|
| 4:13:58| the location criteria for a medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15238)|

| 4:14:23| To allow a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15263)|
| 4:14:25| and a one year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15265)|
| 4:14:27| both of which are needed before any rezoning takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15267)|
| 4:14:32| substantial change conditions must be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15272)|
| 4:14:36| Substantially changed conditions were analyzed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15276)|
| 4:14:38| by Knox County Planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15278)|
| 4:14:40| and you have it all in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15280)|
| 4:14:43| The introduction of significant new roads or utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15283)|

| 4:14:56| and then we can move on to more other changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15296)|
| 4:14:59| We all know North Shore Drive is a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15299)|
| 4:15:03| It's controlled by TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15303)|

| 4:15:09| The Knoxville Regional Transportation Planning Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15309)|
| 4:15:13| examined the North Shore Drive corridor study in 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15313)|
| 4:15:17| as is shown in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| The current level of service for northbound traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15319)|
| 4:15:22| on Lions Bend Road is rated E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15322)|
| 4:15:25| which means there is an unstable traffic flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15325)|
| 4:15:27| with future growth such as this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15327)|
| 4:15:32| The level of service is expected to deteriorate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15332)|
| 4:15:35| to a level F with a dense growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15335)|
| 4:15:38| such as a medium residential up zoned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15338)|
| 4:15:44| No signal at the intersection of Lions Bend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15344)|
| 4:15:46| with North Shore is either slated or funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15346)|
| 4:15:49| Now, I know and you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15349)|
| 4:15:52| that traffic is a problem throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15352)|
| 4:15:54| but that doesn't mean you should throw caution to the wind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15354)|
| 4:15:57| and allow maximum traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15357)|
| 4:16:00| to be generated from this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15360)|

| 4:16:24| by a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15384)|

| 4:17:41| I suggest to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15461)|
| 4:17:43| Mr. Smith has less burdensome alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15463)|
| 4:17:46| that might let him increase the number of dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15466)|
| 4:17:50| in an R1 zone, which is where he's at right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15470)|
| 4:17:53| without opening the door to excessive development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15473)|
| 4:17:57| In the opinion of one of my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15477)|
| 4:17:58| Mr. Smith is swinging for the fences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15478)|
| 4:18:02| instead of pursuing reasonable alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15482)|
| 4:18:05| or seeking a reasonable compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15485)|
| 4:18:07| which is what we tried to do for the past several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15487)|
| 4:18:10| It just didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15490)|
| 4:18:13| Mr. Smith's argument that the Lakeshore Park improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15493)|

| 4:18:18| because residents would frequent the park is disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15498)|
| 4:18:21| It fails to consider the important traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15501)|

| 4:18:48| because Mr. Smith wouldn't tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15528)|
| 4:18:50| We didn't hear from Logan till tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15530)|
| 4:18:53| You know, there's 21 single family residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15533)|
| 4:18:56| he can build right now, 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15536)|
| 4:18:59| And it's not individual driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15539)|
| 4:19:01| He can have a loop driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| In an RN3 zone, he can build with that new density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15543)|
| 4:19:12| 71 townhomes on 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15552)|
| 4:19:15| Now he can't build on all those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15555)|
| 4:19:17| but that just increases the number of townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15557)|
| 4:19:21| to an untenable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15561)|
| 4:19:24| Considering the existing West City sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15564)|
| 4:19:27| the existing city one-year plan and the present zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15567)|
| 4:19:31| changing each of those to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15571)|
| 4:19:33| a medium density residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15573)|
| 4:19:36| for a townhouse development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15576)|
| 4:19:38| without meeting any of the criteria for such a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15578)|
| 4:19:41| is tantamount to what we call spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15581)|
| 4:19:45| And that is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15585)|
| 4:19:47| Spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15587)|
| 4:19:49| A spot zoning ordinance singles out a parcel of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15589)|
| 4:19:52| within the limits of a use district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15592)|
| 4:19:53| and marks it off into a separate district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15593)|
| 4:19:55| thereby permitting a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15595)|
| 4:19:57| That parcel is inconsistent with the use permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15597)|
| 4:20:01| in the rest of that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15601)|
| 4:20:02| That's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15602)|
| 4:20:03| Thank you, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15603)|
| 4:20:05| We'd ask you to deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15605)|
| 4:20:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15607)|
| 4:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15608)|
| 4:20:09| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15609)|
| 4:20:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15610)|
| 4:20:12| I appreciate everybody's patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15612)|
| 4:20:14| in waiting through a long meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15614)|
| 4:20:17| and for your item to be called up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15617)|
| 4:20:19| In that vein, since these three items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15619)|
| 4:20:24| 12G, H, and I, are all dealing with the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15624)|
| 4:20:28| I'd like to make a motion to combine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15628)|
| 4:20:30| all items 12G, H, and I into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15630)|
| 4:20:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15635)|
| 4:20:36| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15636)|
| 4:20:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15637)|
| 4:20:38| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15638)|
| 4:20:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15640)|
| 4:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15642)|
| 4:20:42| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15642)|
| 4:20:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15643)|
| 4:20:44| So just so everybody knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15644)|
| 4:20:46| all we just did was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15646)|
| 4:20:47| there were gonna be three separate votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15647)|
| 4:20:48| We're gonna take one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15648)|
| 4:20:51| And my first question is for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15651)|
| 4:20:56| Director Brooks, staff made a recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15656)|
| 4:21:00| What was that recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15660)|
| 4:21:12| Are none of them working up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15672)|
| 4:21:19| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15679)|
| 4:21:20| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15680)|
| 4:21:21| My microphone wasn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15681)|
| 4:21:22| Amy Brooks, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15682)|
| 4:21:27| Yes, to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15687)|
| 4:21:28| planning staff did not recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15688)|
| 4:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15692)|
| 4:21:32| And when I went through the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15692)|
| 4:21:35| and I want to emphasize again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15695)|
| 4:21:37| that North Shore is a state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15697)|
| 4:21:39| It's not a city route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15699)|
| 4:21:41| City doesn't control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15701)|
| 4:21:45| It said that the traffic level was unstable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15705)|
| 4:21:49| that it was deteriorating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15709)|
| 4:21:51| or expected to deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15711)|
| 4:21:54| A signal is recommended, but not yet slated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15714)|
| 4:21:56| And it would be great if we could get that signal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15716)|
| 4:21:58| because I think that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15718)|
| 4:22:02| Further, it said current road conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15722)|
| 4:22:04| do not support the request sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15724)|
| 4:22:06| to intensify the land use from LDR to MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15726)|
| 4:22:10| which is low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15730)|
| 4:22:12| to medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15732)|
| 4:22:14| There's no change that pertains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15734)|
| 4:22:15| to the increasing residential intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15735)|
| 4:22:17| around the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15737)|
| 4:22:19| The conditions around the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15739)|
| 4:22:21| do not warrant reconsideration of land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15741)|
| 4:22:24| Fourth Creek is identified as a most prone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15744)|
| 4:22:27| to flooding at a drainage or a larger portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15747)|
| 4:22:30| of the center of the sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15750)|
| 4:22:32| and does not support denser residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15752)|
| 4:22:35| And there's no transition area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15755)|
| 4:22:36| between commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15756)|
| 4:22:37| low density residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15757)|
| 4:22:40| and being along or near corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15760)|
| 4:22:41| that are served by proposed transit or sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15761)|
| 4:22:45| All of those items in the staff's report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15765)|
| 4:22:48| give me a lot of pause with thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15768)|
| 4:22:50| about what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15770)|
| 4:22:52| And I have had lots of discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15772)|
| 4:22:56| with the neighborhood folks and Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15776)|
| 4:22:59| and I think that Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15779)|
| 4:23:04| if he was able to do the development that he wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15784)|
| 4:23:08| I think it would be a really high quality product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15788)|
| 4:23:10| I think it would be really nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15790)|
| 4:23:12| The situation in that space is such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15792)|
| 4:23:15| that you could have a very nice townhome situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15795)|
| 4:23:18| condo situation, whatever you're looking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15798)|
| 4:23:21| I have no doubt that he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15801)|
| 4:23:23| The problem that we have in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15803)|
| 4:23:26| is that we don't have planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15806)|
| 4:23:29| And I beat this drum a hundred times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15809)|
| 4:23:31| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15811)|
| 4:23:32| And that's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15812)|
| 4:23:33| This is a challenged property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15813)|
| 4:23:36| If you, it's difficult for Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15816)|
| 4:23:39| to be able to figure out what he can do with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15819)|
| 4:23:42| because he's got all the water surrounding him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15822)|
| 4:23:43| He's got, it's got topography issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15823)|
| 4:23:46| He does have options to think about variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15826)|
| 4:23:49| within the low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15829)|
| 4:23:51| that I think he could pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15831)|
| 4:23:54| But the real fault of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15834)|
| 4:23:57| is not from any of the parties that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15837)|
| 4:23:59| It's because we don't have planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15839)|
| 4:24:02| The county has planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15842)|
| 4:24:04| We had planned residential and we got rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15844)|
| 4:24:07| And I've been on this for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15847)|
| 4:24:09| We need to bring planned residential back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15849)|
| 4:24:11| Now, maybe it's not the same planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15851)|
| 4:24:13| that we had before, maybe it's better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15853)|
| 4:24:15| but we need it and we need it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15855)|
| 4:24:17| because what properties exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15857)|
| 4:24:19| that haven't been developed that aren't challenged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15859)|
| 4:24:22| If it was easy, it already got developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15862)|
| 4:24:25| So anything that's left is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15865)|
| 4:24:28| And when we have planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15868)|
| 4:24:29| then the neighbors and the developer can talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15869)|
| 4:24:32| and they can figure out what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15872)|
| 4:24:34| and they can put it in writing and then we can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15874)|
| 4:24:36| How about we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15876)|
| 4:24:37| That sounds like a high priority thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15877)|
| 4:24:39| that we should be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15879)|
| 4:24:41| That's my soapbox on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15881)|
| 4:24:45| I can't support this just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15885)|
| 4:24:47| of what's in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15887)|
| 4:24:49| And I have no doubt that Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15889)|
| 4:24:52| would be able to produce something that's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15892)|
| 4:24:55| But I just can't run into somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15895)|
| 4:24:56| at the grocery store after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15896)|
| 4:24:58| who says with all that about the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15898)|
| 4:25:02| why did you vote to make it go into medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15902)|
| 4:25:06| I just, I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15906)|
| 4:25:08| So I'm gonna have to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15908)|
| 4:25:10| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15910)|
| 4:25:19| Discussion from other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15919)|
| 4:25:21| Council member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15921)|
| 4:25:23| Yes, for some of the reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15923)|
| 4:25:25| Councilman Roberto is already going over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15925)|
| 4:25:28| and I won't belabor him, we've all had this before him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15928)|
| 4:25:30| but this staff recommendation is basically damning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15930)|
| 4:25:34| I mean, you got seven criteria here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15934)|
| 4:25:37| and the staff has found problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15937)|
| 4:25:39| and objections with every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15939)|
| 4:25:41| Some of them are with traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15941)|
| 4:25:43| some of them are environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15943)|
| 4:25:47| There's no change in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15947)|
| 4:25:49| The criteria are not being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15949)|
| 4:25:52| And I just don't think we can ignore the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15952)|
| 4:25:56| And I've said before that some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15956)|
| 4:26:00| that we're getting out of the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15960)|
| 4:26:02| are, as I've said, are a real stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15962)|
| 4:26:06| as far as meeting criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15966)|
| 4:26:08| And the criteria are there and we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15968)|
| 4:26:11| I think we're derelict if we ignore them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15971)|
| 4:26:13| So I can't support this with this staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15973)|
| 4:26:17| pointing out all these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15977)|
| 4:26:22| There's just, I just can't do it, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15982)|
| 4:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15986)|
| 4:26:27| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15987)|
| 4:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15990)|
| 4:26:31| I guess my question is knowing all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15991)|
| 4:26:36| then why did planning commission approve it 11 to one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=15996)|
| 4:26:43| So please, I'm not trying to get applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16003)|
| 4:26:47| I'm asking a legitimate question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16007)|
| 4:26:49| when we have a staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16009)|
| 4:26:52| because it causes me concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16012)|
| 4:26:54| and puts us as council in a very difficult spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16014)|
| 4:26:59| when we have staff that says one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16019)|
| 4:27:03| and we have the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16023)|
| 4:27:06| that's supposed to interpret all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16026)|
| 4:27:08| And then they go, based on what we've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16028)|
| 4:27:12| that it doesn't meet any of their criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16032)|
| 4:27:14| And I have lots of people I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16034)|
| 4:27:15| and like on planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16035)|
| 4:27:17| So I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16037)|
| 4:27:19| So they must not have interpreted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16039)|
| 4:27:21| the same way staff did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16041)|
| 4:27:25| So that's just an editorial comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16045)|
| 4:27:30| because I don't expect anybody to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16050)|
| 4:27:31| why planning commission voted the way they voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16051)|
| 4:27:35| My question is when I read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16055)|
| 4:27:39| if I look at the zoning code, Mr. Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16059)|
| 4:27:43| when you were talking about there are ways to do variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16063)|
| 4:27:46| and create a, can a townhouse project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16066)|
| 4:27:54| be built in RN1 with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16074)|
| 4:28:01| is that allowed and are exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16081)|
| 4:28:04| allowed to make that happen if it were on special review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16084)|
| 4:28:08| I'm not asking the right questions, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16088)|
| 4:28:10| My brain's a little not pulling the right words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16090)|
| 4:28:14| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16094)|
| 4:28:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16096)|
| 4:28:17| In RN1, you cannot do townhouse developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16097)|
| 4:28:22| So RN3 is the zone that allows for townhouse development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16102)|
| 4:28:26| But you could do a duplex on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16106)|
| 4:28:29| You could do a duplex development, RN1 and RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16109)|
| 4:28:33| Okay, so you could do seven duplexes if you got approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16113)|
| 4:28:43| Potentially, I haven't counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16123)|
| 4:28:44| Okay, I mean, I'm just saying if we said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16124)|
| 4:28:46| you could do seven single family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16126)|
| 4:28:48| then you might be able to do 14 duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16128)|
| 4:28:51| but not a townhome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16131)|
| 4:28:53| In the current, as it's currently set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16133)|
| 4:28:55| Okay, okay, and that would not violate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16135)|
| 4:28:58| any of the existing issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16138)|
| 4:29:03| with developing the property as a RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16143)|
| 4:29:09| I mean, I understand you'd have to have review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16149)|
| 4:29:10| but the environmental concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16150)|
| 4:29:13| all those kind of things would be taken into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16153)|
| 4:29:16| by allowing a duplex as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16156)|
| 4:29:19| Any type of development that they would want to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16159)|
| 4:29:22| would need to be reviewed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16162)|
| 4:29:25| City's Plans Review Inspection Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16165)|
| 4:29:27| to make sure that it met all requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16167)|
| 4:29:29| But you could have multiple single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16169)|
| 4:29:33| I believe I heard seven would probably fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16173)|
| 4:29:35| but that's on 15 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16175)|
| 4:29:36| and we heard that 15 acres isn't usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16176)|
| 4:29:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16180)|
| 4:29:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16182)|
| 4:29:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16184)|
| 4:29:49| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16189)|
| 4:29:51| I just have one, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16191)|
| 4:29:54| To me, the big question mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16194)|
| 4:29:56| that I feel like I'm unclear about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16196)|
| 4:29:58| is how many units can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16198)|
| 4:30:02| I mean, just, I know the 72 seems a bit unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16202)|
| 4:30:07| There's the water runoff issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16207)|
| 4:30:11| There's the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16211)|
| 4:30:13| I don't have a clear view of what is possible there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16213)|
| 4:30:16| and in talking to all the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16216)|
| 4:30:18| I only hear what Mr. Smith has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16218)|
| 4:30:21| and Mr. Smith, do you want to respond to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16221)|
| 4:30:24| You're welcome to come up, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16224)|
| 4:30:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16227)|
| 4:30:29| Your question is how many units can be built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16229)|
| 4:30:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16231)|
| 4:30:32| The way this zoning code, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16232)|
| 4:30:34| is you have to submit an entire plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16234)|
| 4:30:37| engineers, architectural, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16237)|
| 4:30:40| It's extremely expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16240)|
| 4:30:42| and we're supposed to get the zoning first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16242)|
| 4:30:44| and then go back and get the plan done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16244)|
| 4:30:46| and all this does is allow me to submit a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16246)|
| 4:30:48| It doesn't rubber stamp anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16248)|
| 4:30:51| and that's the process that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16251)|
| 4:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16254)|
| 4:30:55| What was another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16255)|
| 4:30:56| I was just, I'm trying to get a clear answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16256)|
| 4:30:58| from someone around how many units can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16258)|
| 4:31:01| I volunteer to limit that to no more than 20 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16261)|
| 4:31:04| In the event we could get more than 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16264)|
| 4:31:06| I committed to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16266)|
| 4:31:07| that we would not build more than 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16267)|
| 4:31:09| so everybody I've talked to has also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16269)|
| 4:31:13| everybody else I've talked to has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16273)|
| 4:31:16| that that amount of units would not be consequential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16276)|
| 4:31:19| to the traffic at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16279)|
| 4:31:21| Mr. Mullins, do you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16281)|
| 4:31:23| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16283)|
| 4:31:24| Mr. Mullins, would you like to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16284)|
| 4:31:26| Yeah, I mean, if you're looking at the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16286)|
| 4:31:29| of units that can be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16289)|
| 4:31:30| I mean, there's a minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16290)|
| 4:31:32| you have to have 12,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16292)|
| 4:31:34| for the first three townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16294)|
| 4:31:36| and then 3,000 square feet for each additional townhome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16296)|
| 4:31:39| That's the dimensional design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16299)|
| 4:31:41| in the RN3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16301)|
| 4:31:42| So if you look at the 1.7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16302)|
| 4:31:44| which is what's outside the floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16304)|
| 4:31:46| that's what you could build without having to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16306)|
| 4:31:49| a no-rise study and lift it one foot above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16309)|
| 4:31:51| a 500-year flood plain, that's where I got the 1.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16311)|
| 4:31:54| That would equal 23 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16314)|
| 4:31:57| That does not count the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16317)|
| 4:31:58| it does not count the parking areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16318)|
| 4:32:00| it does not count any buffering or any access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16320)|
| 4:32:03| which is why my estimate to you when I spoke earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16323)|
| 4:32:06| was that the most that you could build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16326)|
| 4:32:07| would be between 10 and 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16327)|
| 4:32:09| but until you really dig into the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16329)|
| 4:32:12| you won't know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16332)|
| 4:32:14| Mr. Kline, did you want to, in fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16334)|
| 4:32:16| respond to that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16336)|
| 4:32:17| I sure do, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16337)|
| 4:32:21| We did an evaluation based upon the number of square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16341)|
| 4:32:25| and the acreage that's available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16345)|
| 4:32:27| and that they're saying is two to five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16347)|
| 4:32:29| somewhere around there, and if that's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16349)|
| 4:32:33| then in the existing zone, RN1, that's there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16353)|
| 4:32:38| it can have 21 lots, there's single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16358)|
| 4:32:44| And RN2, it could have 43 lots of single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16364)|
| 4:32:49| and it can also have duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16369)|
| 4:32:51| It can't have townhouses until it gets up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16371)|
| 4:32:53| to the medium density, which is an RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16373)|
| 4:32:56| And at five acres, it could have 71 lots for townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16376)|
| 4:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16380)|
| 4:33:02| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16382)|
| 4:33:04| Yeah, Mr. Howley, I'm going to put you on the spot there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16384)|
| 4:33:08| but is that a succinct or correct way to summarize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16388)|
| 4:33:11| that you have to get the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16391)|
| 4:33:14| and then spend all the money on all the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16394)|
| 4:33:17| and everything to be able to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16397)|
| 4:33:18| with a calculation of the number of units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16398)|
| 4:33:21| That's typically the way that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16401)|
| 4:33:23| I think I summarized what Mr. Smith said correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16403)|
| 4:33:24| Yeah, that's typically what you would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16404)|
| 4:33:26| The investment to go through the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16406)|
| 4:33:28| to find out what can be done before you have the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16408)|
| 4:33:31| is a large expense to have at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16411)|
| 4:33:34| And there are a lot of things going on on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16414)|
| 4:33:37| A lot of them have already been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16417)|
| 4:33:38| I think the ones I have written down is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16418)|
| 4:33:40| there's a buffer associated with the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16420)|
| 4:33:42| a no-fill line, most likely a TVA flowage easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16422)|
| 4:33:45| the irregular shape, the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16425)|
| 4:33:48| All those things lend into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16428)|
| 4:33:50| what available space there is to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16430)|
| 4:33:52| But there's also some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16432)|
| 4:33:54| if you give and take with some of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16434)|
| 4:33:57| And so to give you, it's two acres or 2.5 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16437)|
| 4:34:01| that's hard to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16441)|
| 4:34:03| My rough estimate was around two usable acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16443)|
| 4:34:07| But like I say- Out of the entire 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16447)|
| 4:34:09| Yes, I'd say half of it is underwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16449)|
| 4:34:11| So that's kind of unbuildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16451)|
| 4:34:13| It's more than half according to KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16453)|
| 4:34:16| Right, and then there's a 60-foot buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16456)|
| 4:34:18| along the Fourth Creek on the backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16458)|
| 4:34:21| There's some hillside protection to the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16461)|
| 4:34:24| And the road is not straight through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16464)|
| 4:34:27| so there's some irregularities as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16467)|
| 4:34:30| the way you would build in a more squared-off fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16470)|
| 4:34:32| So it's kind of hard to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16472)|
| 4:34:35| the answer you're probably looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16475)|
| 4:34:36| but just because there's so many different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16476)|
| 4:34:38| going on this site to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16478)|
| 4:34:42| when you come up with what area is actually usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16482)|
| 4:34:45| And it is depending on what kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16485)|
| 4:34:46| creative site plan someone came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16486)|
| 4:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16490)|
| 4:34:51| Councilwoman Helsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16491)|
| 4:34:54| Director Brooks, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16494)|
| 4:34:55| Director Brooks, when this was denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16495)|
| 4:34:58| and I know we talked about this a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16498)|
| 4:35:00| but it was the first time it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16500)|
| 4:35:03| You all don't take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16503)|
| 4:35:05| like the 72 units that we kept hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16505)|
| 4:35:08| that that's all I heard until I think yesterday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16508)|
| 4:35:13| So just to clarify this, the request wasn't denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16513)|
| 4:35:16| It was approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16516)|
| 4:35:19| By staff, I'm sorry, by Planning Staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16519)|
| 4:35:20| Staff does make recommendations to Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16520)|
| 4:35:24| and they don't always follow our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16524)|
| 4:35:26| They take additional information in during the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16526)|
| 4:35:34| but I'm not sure if I've answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16534)|
| 4:35:37| We kept hearing the number 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16537)|
| 4:35:38| Everything I saw written, 72 townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16538)|
| 4:35:41| and everybody I talked to was always 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16541)|
| 4:35:44| And that was based on the total acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16544)|
| 4:35:47| but as has been noted, there are additional considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16547)|
| 4:35:53| I'm sorry, I'm really tired of considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16553)|
| 4:35:56| But if this was to be approved, it does have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16556)|
| 4:36:00| So it's very similar to how the planned residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16560)|
| 4:36:03| are considered in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16563)|
| 4:36:06| and were previously considered in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16566)|
| 4:36:08| So in order to do townhomes in R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16568)|
| 4:36:11| it does have to come back for a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16571)|
| 4:36:13| So someone has to present a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16573)|
| 4:36:15| to the Planning Commission for it to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16575)|
| 4:36:16| and approved prior to it going to City Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16576)|
| 4:36:20| and Plans Review and Inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16580)|
| 4:36:23| Does the number of units affect the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16583)|
| 4:36:25| that planning staff denied it is my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16585)|
| 4:36:27| Like we kept hearing this huge number that apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16587)|
| 4:36:31| I don't know where it came from, but that's all we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16591)|
| 4:36:33| No, we usually do like a back of the envelope calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16593)|
| 4:36:37| just for information purposes, but it is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16597)|
| 4:36:40| it did not, we were looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16600)|
| 4:36:43| or the staff were looking at specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16603)|
| 4:36:44| at the criteria for the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16604)|
| 4:36:47| not how many units could be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16607)|
| 4:36:49| If it was less than 20, which is what we're hearing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16609)|
| 4:36:53| if that was in front of you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16613)|
| 4:36:55| would that still be denied by planning staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16615)|
| 4:36:58| Again, for rezonings, we're looking at all the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16618)|
| 4:37:00| that are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16620)|
| 4:37:01| We don't, we're not specifically looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16621)|
| 4:37:03| okay, are they going to build townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16623)|
| 4:37:05| duplexes, single family homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16625)|
| 4:37:07| Because we don't know at the time of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16627)|
| 4:37:08| of what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16628)|
| 4:37:12| So because somebody says they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16632)|
| 4:37:13| they're going to do something, that mean they will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16633)|
| 4:37:16| Sorry, I mean, you could sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16636)|
| 4:37:17| There's a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16637)|
| 4:37:18| I mean, there's just a lot of other factors to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16638)|
| 4:37:20| So we just try to look at all the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16640)|
| 4:37:22| that could potentially be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16642)|
| 4:37:25| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16645)|
| 4:37:26| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16646)|
| 4:37:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16649)|
| 4:37:30| Mr. Klein, the number has not been as high as 72| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16650)|
| 4:37:36| because we're not looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16656)|
| 4:37:37| we're just looking at two and a half acres now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16657)|
| 4:37:39| but I'm getting the feeling that the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16659)|
| 4:37:42| is more against any number of townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16662)|
| 4:37:46| versus the same number or equal residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16666)|
| 4:37:50| of single family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16670)|
| 4:37:52| that the problem is the attached housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16672)|
| 4:37:54| more so than that there will be density there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16674)|
| 4:37:57| The problem is going from low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16677)|
| 4:38:00| to medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16680)|
| 4:38:03| Townhouses, single family residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16683)|
| 4:38:06| that's really ancillary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16686)|
| 4:38:08| Moving to MDR, a medium density residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16688)|
| 4:38:13| in this area that is south of North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16693)|
| 4:38:17| creates a completely different environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16697)|
| 4:38:21| It's a transition zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16701)|
| 4:38:23| should be have commercial on one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16703)|
| 4:38:25| residential on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16705)|
| 4:38:26| And so to inject an MDR into this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16706)|
| 4:38:32| is the objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16712)|
| 4:38:34| So if it was, if we did a rezoning to RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16714)|
| 4:38:40| then by special use, could we do townhomes and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16720)|
| 4:38:46| Not in an RN2, it has to be an RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16726)|
| 4:38:49| Townhomes are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16729)|
| 4:38:49| How about duplexes in a RN2 with special permission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16729)|
| 4:38:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16733)|
| 4:38:54| Would there be an objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16734)|
| 4:38:56| Well, there'd be an objection to going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16736)|
| 4:38:58| at a higher, to a higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16738)|
| 4:38:59| At all, so it's not just the lower to medium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16739)|
| 4:39:02| even the transition area doesn't feel okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16742)|
| 4:39:05| The transition area is in an RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16745)|
| 4:39:09| It's defined within the RN3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16749)|
| 4:39:12| And my folks don't want to go to a medium density zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16752)|
| 4:39:17| because of the effect it will have on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16757)|
| 4:39:22| I'm just asking what is your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16762)|
| 4:39:24| changing why it's good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16764)|
| 4:39:26| Gee, I'd have to talk to my clients about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16766)|
| 4:39:30| I don't think they, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16770)|
| 4:39:33| I'd have to talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16773)|
| 4:39:35| No, I just talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16775)|
| 4:39:38| They said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16778)|
| 4:39:43| Councilwoman Singh, will you please turn your mic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16783)|
| 4:39:45| right back on real fast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16785)|
| 4:39:48| Just makes me feel that no change is wanted at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16788)|
| 4:39:51| Well, that's not true at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16791)|
| 4:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16792)|
| 4:39:53| That's not true at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16793)|
| 4:39:54| Really, we have worked with Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16794)|
| 4:39:56| trying to talk about how about putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16796)|
| 4:39:59| a circular driveway in and putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16799)|
| 4:40:01| single family residential in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16801)|
| 4:40:03| How about, we even talked about going to an RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16803)|
| 4:40:06| because there's a smaller footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16806)|
| 4:40:08| for single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16808)|
| 4:40:11| But to go to a medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16811)|
| 4:40:13| there's so many factors that you're not even considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16813)|
| 4:40:17| But look at staff report to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16817)|
| 4:40:21| None of the conditions that are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16821)|
| 4:40:23| for a sector plan amendment or a one year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16823)|
| 4:40:28| are met, none, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16828)|
| 4:40:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16831)|
| 4:40:34| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16834)|
| 4:40:39| I'll just add my last comment and then we'll vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16839)|
| 4:40:41| just for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16841)|
| 4:40:42| Mr. Smith, I think if you were to do 10 to 20 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16842)|
| 4:40:46| of some type there, I think that's fitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16846)|
| 4:40:48| based on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16848)|
| 4:40:49| I watched the planning commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16849)|
| 4:40:50| and understood the dialogue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16850)|
| 4:40:52| And with that said, to me, there's too much possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16852)|
| 4:40:56| and too much uncertainty associated with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16856)|
| 4:40:59| I get the process by which you have to go get it rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16859)|
| 4:41:02| and then before you have the cash outlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16862)|
| 4:41:04| of all the expenses and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16864)|
| 4:41:05| But to me, the target is too fuzzy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16865)|
| 4:41:09| for me to support the MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16869)|
| 4:41:11| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16871)|
| 4:41:16| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16876)|
| 4:41:18| There's a Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16878)|
| 4:41:23| No, I'm too tired myself to even ask this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16883)|
| 4:41:24| but I will ask really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16884)|
| 4:41:27| Just to clarify, and I'm sorry, I know y'all are tired too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16887)|
| 4:41:33| Remind me how many single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16893)|
| 4:41:35| we anticipate might be able to be built on this two acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16895)|
| 4:41:42| Or maybe for Mr. Mullins is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16902)|
| 4:41:44| If you're talking about the current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16904)|
| 4:41:47| the single family residential in the RN1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16907)|
| 4:41:50| requires a 10,000 square foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16910)|
| 4:41:52| So the maximum density would be 4.35, 3.56 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16912)|
| 4:41:58| an acre, and so if you're looking at a two acre envelope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16918)|
| 4:42:02| of development, then you're looking at what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16922)|
| 4:42:07| You asked me to do math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16927)|
| 4:42:09| It's dangerous at any circumstance, 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16929)|
| 4:42:10| But yeah, you really couldn't do much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16930)|
| 4:42:15| And I guarantee if we move forward with RN1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16935)|
| 4:42:17| and put duplexes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16937)|
| 4:42:19| everybody behind us would be objecting to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16939)|
| 4:42:22| It's about the type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16942)|
| 4:42:23| It's not about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16943)|
| 4:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16945)|
| 4:42:27| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16947)|
| 4:42:28| Well, can I finish my thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16948)|
| 4:42:29| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16949)|
| 4:42:30| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16950)|
| 4:42:33| I asked that question for that very reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16953)|
| 4:42:40| because I think it's important to be able to envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16960)|
| 4:42:44| what the outcome might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16964)|
| 4:42:46| And under an RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16966)|
| 4:42:52| we're talking about a certain number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16972)|
| 4:42:54| and then by special use could consider duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16974)|
| 4:43:00| increasing the number of residents at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16980)|
| 4:43:08| And then the RN3, under that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16988)|
| 4:43:12| what I'm hearing is a similar number of residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16992)|
| 4:43:16| under that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16996)|
| 4:43:18| However, I am sympathetic to the argument of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=16998)|
| 4:43:24| and the planning staff, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17004)|
| 4:43:26| that when making a zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17006)|
| 4:43:30| you have to consider all uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17010)|
| 4:43:33| I just wish we would do that consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17013)|
| 4:43:37| and in all neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17017)|
| 4:43:40| And so that's one issue that gives me pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17020)|
| 4:43:45| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17025)|
| 4:43:48| Yeah, I think that Councilmember Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17028)|
| 4:43:54| made a lot of really valid points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17034)|
| 4:43:57| The fact that the planning commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17037)|
| 4:44:00| recommended denial and when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17040)|
| 4:44:03| I think what also needs to be pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17043)|
| 4:44:05| for anyone that didn't look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17045)|
| 4:44:07| is the aerial maps in KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17047)|
| 4:44:12| The 15 acres that are in the maps that we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17052)|
| 4:44:17| don't quite, though they show a lot of water too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17057)|
| 4:44:21| don't quite convey what I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17061)|
| 4:44:22| when I look at the aerial in KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17062)|
| 4:44:25| It's literally, it's the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17065)|
| 4:44:29| We're being asked to rezone the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17069)|
| 4:44:31| Well, Mr. Smith, you're shaking your head yes at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17071)|
| 4:44:33| and I'm just like, we're being asked to rezone the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17073)|
| 4:44:37| And so if I owned a postage stamp of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17077)|
| 4:44:41| apparently Siri has taken over the iPad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17081)|
| 4:44:45| If I had a postage stamp of lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17085)|
| 4:44:48| she wants to be part of the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17088)|
| 4:44:51| next to the lake, much smaller than yours, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17091)|
| 4:44:54| Let's say I owned a one acre abutting a lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17094)|
| 4:44:58| but I happen to own underneath the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17098)|
| 4:45:00| because six months out of the year it's not the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17100)|
| 4:45:03| it's the sides of the creek and the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17103)|
| 4:45:06| I just think that's a little odd to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17106)|
| 4:45:09| to get higher density based on the bed of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17109)|
| 4:45:14| We're just gonna disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17114)|
| 4:45:17| So it's fine, but I'm just like, wow, it's the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17117)|
| 4:45:22| It's the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17122)|
| 4:45:23| So anyway, I'm gonna be supporting the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17123)|
| 4:45:30| Does everybody remember the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17130)|
| 4:45:33| The motion on the floor in a second is to deny the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17133)|
| 4:45:38| Any questions or discussion before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17138)|
