| 2:50:05| all across the county, whether they live inside the city limits or outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10205)|
| 2:50:11| And 60%, I believe, of our senior citizens actually live outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10211)|
| 2:50:16| So these are the seniors who are dependent on CAC Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| In the past, when we had Mercy Health Systems here, they gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10220)|
| 2:50:25| they had a $200,000 a year contract with CAC to provide this transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10225)|
| 2:50:31| When they were bought out by Tenova, Tenova decided that they would not do that any longer because they're not a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10231)|
| 2:50:39| They don't have a mission like Mercy did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| And so that's a $200,000 chunk that's been cut from CAC Transit's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10243)|
| 2:50:51| And that equates to over 20 round-trip trips per day for our senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10251)|
| 2:51:02| Right now, we have over 18 people on the waiting list for job transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10262)|
| 2:51:08| These are people where jobs are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| They've been offered jobs, but they don't have transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| We also are turning down about 50 people a day who call in and need transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10274)|
| 2:51:20| So $300,000 is not going to fix all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| It's not even going to come close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| But it is going to allow CAC Transit to operate at the same level that they've been operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10287)|
| 2:51:36| and we'll give them a little extra to help hopefully whittle down that waiting list for job transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10296)|
| 2:51:46| so that they don't have to turn away 50 of our senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| and people with disabilities every single day who just need to get to the doctor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| to the grocery store, to the pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| So I would ask that that be included or at least considered in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10320)|
| 2:52:08| And, you know, we've had a lot of really incredible people who went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10328)|
| 2:52:14| who were dependent on public transportation who came down here last Tuesday and spoke to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10334)|
| 2:52:23| and who also came down today and spoke to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| And I was very impressed by the fact that even though they were here to speak for their own need, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10346)|
| 2:52:34| they also took the opportunity to speak to the needs of our community's children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10354)|
| 2:52:39| and to speak to the needs of other people in other groups besides just their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10359)|
| 2:52:48| And that's something that deeply impressed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| So those are the points that I have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| I made a note to myself to start this out to be sure and be gentle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10380)|
| 2:53:07| because being a career teacher sometimes you have this sort of pent-up frustrations over 30 years of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10387)|
| 2:53:19| that have gone on where you've, you know, you've been pretty vocal about saying things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10399)|
| 2:53:25| what do they do over there in that A.J. building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10405)|
| 2:53:29| And so obviously when you're a career teacher, as a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10409)|
| 2:53:35| we have a lot of career teachers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| I greatly respect those that, and I'm going to speak, by the way, to support the mayor's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10418)|
| 2:53:45| and to oppose the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10425)|
| 2:53:50| And we've got a lot of teachers that are on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10430)|
| 2:53:53| But I feel compelled to speak for those that I consider the many who are silent on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10433)|
| 2:54:02| And they would be silent, and there is some silence out of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10442)|
| 2:54:09| And I greatly appreciate Bob Savory coming and speaking the way he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10449)|
| 2:54:17| That takes great courage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| And there are some other teachers that have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10459)|
| 2:54:23| That's an amazing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| I have fundamental issues with the proposal that the schools have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10465)|
| 2:54:32| First of all, it starts at the wrong end of the production line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| The focus is on the wrong end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| It's on the classroom in terms of how they, what they expect of teachers, this merit pay system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10481)|
| 2:54:50| the evaluation system is all focused there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| As a few people have said, there are great questions about merit pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10496)|
| 2:55:02| There is significant research to reject the idea that it is a method for improving education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10502)|
| 2:55:15| And I greatly appreciate and respect my colleague, Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10515)|
| 2:55:21| But the school system, I think, effectively is a business, and then it's not a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10521)|
| 2:55:27| The business portion of the school system is across the street on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10527)|
| 2:55:32| That's a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| The classrooms, the school buildings themselves, are in some sense a business also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10534)|
| 2:55:42| But the classroom is not a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| Teachers love to do what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| They love their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| They love their subject areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10550)|
| 2:55:54| And to think that you're going to incentivize teachers with this system and this system of APEX| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10554)|
| 2:56:03| or TEAM or whatever it is, it's a severe mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10563)|
| 2:56:08| And I think in just a matter of a few years we'll look back and we'll say it wasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10568)|
| 2:56:15| it didn't do what we thought it would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| That's my fundamental disagreement with the proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10579)|
| 2:56:24| It has to do with merit pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| It has to do with this just onerous evaluation system that is loading teachers up with work that they do not need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10586)|
| 2:56:38| This is contrary to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10598)|
| 2:56:44| It is anathema to what we really want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10604)|
| 2:56:49| And we're going to find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| I'm pretty sure we're going to find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| In confidence people, I've had struggles with the issue of central office for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10614)|
| 2:57:01| I have frequently said, look at the organizational chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10621)|
| 2:57:06| and I think it should be subtitled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10626)|
| 2:57:09| The Society for the Preservation of Nepotism and Cronyism in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10629)|
| 2:57:18| For some reason the school system, and I wonder if Mildred Dole is still ruling from the grave, but they get a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10638)|
| 2:57:29| The school system central management gets a pass in terms of criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10649)|
| 2:57:35| I don't quite understand that from a media standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10655)|
| 2:57:40| You can get a teacher that has problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| They'll get barbecued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| A principal will get barbecued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| But for some reason it's hands off, gloves off across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10668)|
| 2:57:53| I do not understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| And I think that it's you could confirm that historically with how things have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10675)|
| 2:58:05| In confidence, even the supporters of the school's proposal will use words like overstaffed, incompetent, waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10685)|
| 2:58:21| They don't say that in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10701)|
| 2:58:25| But in private we know that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| We know it's too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| We know it's several times too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| And it's part of the process and part of the reason why we need to reject this sub motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10712)|
| 2:58:41| and accept the mayor's proposal because of the stress that it will place on central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10721)|
| 2:58:49| That's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10729)|
| 2:58:50| We need stress on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| And then in the process, I hope in the coming year, which now we're talking about the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10732)|
| 2:58:59| which is interesting, an inclusion of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10739)|
| 2:59:03| Wow, what a novel concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| We need to get the teachers on board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| Well, this plan was not inclusive of the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10748)|
| 2:59:13| It's its most severe flaw and severe mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| So I would propose that we support the mayor's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10756)|
| 2:59:23| I would also encourage, and this is one thing that I will do in the coming weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10763)|
| 2:59:30| I think it would also be very helpful at this time to consider an audit, a very detailed audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10770)|
| 2:59:41| of the non-instructional programs within schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10781)|
| 2:59:45| This has been needed for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10785)|
| 2:59:48| and I certainly will bring that to the Audit Committee and to Dr. Carsello for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10788)|
| 2:59:55| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10797)|
| 3:00:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| I think it's safe to say that everybody sitting up here around this table has spent an agonizing last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10803)|
| 3:00:14| in checking, rechecking, digging, digging, digging, digging some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10814)|
| 3:00:21| We have had more statistics thrown at us over the last month from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10821)|
| 3:00:29| You can make charts and graphs, say whatever you want them to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10829)|
| 3:00:36| But let me say this up front right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10836)|
| 3:00:39| This is where the biggest boon to Knox County education could come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10839)|
| 3:00:46| And it don't cost a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| It costs you some time, those of you that have kids or grandkids or you're guardians of those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10848)|
| 3:00:57| Let the teachers discipline them in the schools, and you'll have some better schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10857)|
| 3:01:02| But let them do some discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10862)|
| 3:01:05| Little Johnny comes home, or you send a note home to Little Johnny that he was misbehaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10865)|
| 3:01:10| what else you going to get to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| That's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10876)|
| 3:01:19| You know, there's been a lot of back and forth, back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10879)|
| 3:01:23| And I've told two or three people, I don't think Knox County has been this divided since the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10883)|
| 3:01:29| But one thing it has done, it has wakened up the people to the notion that we do have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10889)|
| 3:01:39| with education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| Two or three times it's been mentioned about the number of calls and the number of e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10904)|
| 3:01:51| They're up there around 1,500 on e-mails and probably 300, 400 calls on phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10911)|
| 3:01:58| Now, we can't get back to them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| And I apologize to those that we haven't been able to get back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| But you have to be able to sort out what people are saying versus what they write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10923)|
| 3:02:13| Just to say I don't want no more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| Granted, there are some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| But you've got to look at the ones that have some legitimate reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10938)|
| 3:02:22| and before and against this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10942)|
| 3:02:26| I spent about five days going in every school in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10946)|
| 3:02:32| Plus, I've talked to teachers, principals, parents, former educators in other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10952)|
| 3:02:39| trying to get some kind of a feel on what has been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10959)|
| 3:02:45| I've been around Knox County for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10965)|
| 3:02:48| I've never had the occasion to get this involved in what's going on in the school system before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10968)|
| 3:02:55| Believe me, folks, when I tell you there is a tremendous amount of distrust in anything that the school system has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10975)|
| 3:03:04| because of past performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10984)|
| 3:03:07| Now, granted, just don't put the shoe all on one foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10987)|
| 3:03:10| The same could be said for this body or any other political office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| But there are some that are trying to make changes in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| And I applaud Dr. McIntyre for his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10998)|
| 3:03:20| I think it's a fabulous plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11000)|
| 3:03:22| It's a very, very, very aggressive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11002)|
| 3:03:25| But like I've told him and several other people, you know, you can eat an elephant a bite at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11005)|
| 3:03:30| I just don't think you can put the whole elephant on the plate at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11010)|
| 3:03:36| Mr. McKenzie mentioned accountability a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| That's the one word I heard across the whole gamut of phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11019)|
| 3:03:44| Now, my phone calls across the county run, again, about the rest of them two to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11024)|
| 3:03:49| But I'll tell you what they ran in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11029)|
| 3:03:52| They ran about 93 percent against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| We're each elected up here to represent the folks in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11035)|
| 3:03:59| If we have any hope of leading them forward in any way, we have to have their trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11039)|
| 3:04:08| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| So I've made a pledge to Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11050)|
| 3:04:13| I will help him with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11053)|
| 3:04:14| But sometimes you've got to be like the Army General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| You have to fall back and regroup and make another battle plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| And I think that's where we're at right now in this particular subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11060)|
| 3:04:26| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| Commissioner, are you going to speak on the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| The way we've worded our motions, we're going to have to add the amendments in all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| or change the way we've done our motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| So I'm going to speak on another amendment that I'm going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| So if you want to discuss schools, I'll wait until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11082)|
| 3:04:47| I was going to just address your substitute motion, which I consider an excellent compromise to the issue that we're confronted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11087)|
| 3:04:58| As has been mentioned, it's the most divisive issue I've confronted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11098)|
| 3:05:02| or dealt with in my three-and-a-half years on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11102)|
| 3:05:07| When I first --when the issue first came up, it was sort of like the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11112)|
| 3:05:13| Five or six to one in favor, I guess, of the people who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11113)|
| 3:05:16| And I appreciate everyone coming in and speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| But the e-mails and the phone calls I got were five or six to one, eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11119)|
| 3:05:23| And then it slowly started to even out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11123)|
| 3:05:26| And then it could have been because of the publicity given to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11126)|
| 3:05:30| or robo-calls that went out or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11130)|
| 3:05:32| But then it suddenly surged the other way to six or eight to one the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11132)|
| 3:05:37| And we had a --I met with some commissioners yesterday in a duly sunshine noticed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11137)|
| 3:05:42| And we had --Commissioner Burles and I had some debate about some of the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11142)|
| 3:05:47| And we didn't really agree on how accurate they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11147)|
| 3:05:52| But my opinion is it's running two, two-and-a-half to one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11152)|
| 3:05:57| That's, again, my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| That's worth almost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11159)|
| 3:06:00| But countywide, that seems to be the numbers I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11160)|
| 3:06:05| And I think I've got --I didn't count them like possibly Mr. Brown did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11165)|
| 3:06:09| but I believe I'm well in excess of 2,000 e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11169)|
| 3:06:12| Oftentimes I'll get something sent to Commissioner Anders and Hammond and myself just like people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11172)|
| 3:06:17| I think that's the at-large where the at-large comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11177)|
| 3:06:19| And I appreciate every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| And I do apologize for not corresponding with every one of them because the staff is me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11181)|
| 3:06:26| You know, it's not girls upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11186)|
| 3:06:29| They took, I mean, how many phone calls did they take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11189)|
| 3:06:31| I think 1,300 or something, 1,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11191)|
| 3:06:36| I did call back as many as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| If somebody specifically said, call me, I did my best to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11198)|
| 3:06:42| And I did respond to as many e-mails as I physically could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11202)|
| 3:06:48| But looking at where we are in this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| I think what Chairman Hammond has put on the table is a good compromise to move this matter forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11210)|
| 3:07:00| It does the programs that we've heard so much about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11220)|
| 3:07:06| It funds those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| It puts the technology, the three hot buttons that I picked up, no accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11228)|
| 3:07:14| although we've addressed that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| The iPads for some reason were, to me, and of course I got a massive lightning rod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11237)|
| 3:07:25| and just the aversion to a tax increase in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| That's the three hot buttons that I seem to get feedback from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11247)|
| 3:07:31| But so it puts, this will put the technology and the 20-plus million for Adrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11251)|
| 3:07:38| Burnett, Shannondale, Pongap, Barragat, others, STEM school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11258)|
| 3:07:45| It puts that off a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11265)|
| 3:07:46| It doesn't kill those things, but it puts them off for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11266)|
| 3:07:49| and then it gives the opportunity to those here in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| and those throughout the community, the chamber, Save Our Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11274)|
| 3:07:57| Greater Schools Partnership, PTA Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11277)|
| 3:08:00| and a dozen other fine organizations that I respect and participate with and in to sell that to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11280)|
| 3:08:09| And I just don't think the public in general is not sold on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11289)|
| 3:08:12| If it would go to referendum, I think tomorrow it would fail substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11292)|
| 3:08:16| But if it would go to referendum in a year, it might pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11296)|
| 3:08:19| It depends on the campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| So I applaud Chairman Deakins and Mr. Hammond, Chairman Hammond, for coming up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11301)|
| 3:08:28| I think it's a good compromise to move this effort forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11308)|
| 3:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11313)|
| 3:08:36| Mr. Andrews, do you want to talk now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11316)|
| 3:08:37| Or Commissioner McKenzie, do you want to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| He wants to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11319)|
| 3:08:40| I think I want to be piggybacking on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| Let's, yeah, if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11323)|
| 3:08:44| Just the mechanics of it is what I need to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11324)|
| 3:08:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11326)|
| 3:08:47| What I want to do is, Mr. Jarrett, let's, first of all, we need to go, we've suspended the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11327)|
| 3:08:51| We'll need to vote to go back to our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| But before we do that, Mr. Jarrett, with regards to amendments to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11334)|
| 3:08:59| we have a substitute motion on the floor with regards to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11339)|
| 3:09:02| If others want to have a vote on other amendments, what is the proper procedure to do that with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11342)|
| 3:09:08| Well, conceivably, sir, under Section 2549 of the Knox County Code, as compared to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11348)|
| 3:09:16| once you pass a consolidated budget, you then have the ability to amend that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11356)|
| 3:09:21| And that is, of course, providing the funds exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| So let's say conceivably your motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| A commissioner could then offer an amendment to the budget you just passed to either, to essentially, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11367)|
| 3:09:34| seek additional funding, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11374)|
| 3:09:37| Going backwards would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11377)|
| 3:09:38| And, of course, interfering with the, your maintenance of effort for both the Sheriff and Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11378)|
| 3:09:45| But that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11385)|
| 3:09:46| So, in other words, if your motion passes, that doesn't mean your job here is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11386)|
| 3:09:50| If someone wants to offer an amendment, you can certainly entertain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11390)|
| 3:09:54| Can we vote individually on the amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11394)|
| 3:09:56| Yes, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11396)|
| 3:09:57| I would suggest we vote individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11397)|
| 3:10:00| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| I'm fine to go back into rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11402)|
| 3:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11404)|
| 3:10:05| We'll need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11405)|
| 3:10:06| Commissioner Norman, did you want to speak before we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11406)|
| 3:10:09| Yes, I wanted to speak to the sub motion one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11409)|
| 3:10:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11412)|
| 3:10:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11413)|
| 3:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| I would encourage the board to consider what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11416)|
| 3:10:26| Obviously, there's been this is a last minute attempt to get something for the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11426)|
| 3:10:35| and maybe that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11435)|
| 3:10:39| What I think, though, is the rejection of the sub motion is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11439)|
| 3:10:45| And what that would accomplish is the statement to the school system that we need to rethink this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11445)|
| 3:10:56| We don't need to adopt any part of this merit pay plan or evaluation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11456)|
| 3:11:07| We just don't need to make a statement to the school system to acknowledge their mistakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11467)|
| 3:11:14| and their flaws in this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11474)|
| 3:11:17| And to do anything other than to support the mayor's budget would be to be contrary to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11477)|
| 3:11:27| If I might speak, I'd like to just mention something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11487)|
| 3:11:32| Commissioner, with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11492)|
| 3:11:33| I don't really think this is a last minute effort to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11493)|
| 3:11:36| When you looked at the proposal that we've had before us for weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11496)|
| 3:11:39| $28 million was for technology and for construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11499)|
| 3:11:44| The $7 million was basically to go into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| What I'm suggesting is that we take that $7 million, $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| the mayor has already committed to an early literacy program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11511)|
| 3:11:54| I'm suggesting that we take $4 million and that we go ahead and do the community schools concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11514)|
| 3:11:59| which I'm a believer after being there at Pond Gap and seeing what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11519)|
| 3:12:02| and seeing how lives are changed, I'm a believer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11522)|
| 3:12:05| And you look at the enrichment programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| and you look at the additional teaching and the teacher restoration and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| I just believe this is the thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| And so I don't want to give the impression that this is a last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11533)|
| 3:12:17| because to me what I'm asking is that we go ahead with the seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11537)|
| 3:12:23| and that the 28 be put on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11543)|
| 3:12:26| So, anyway, I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11546)|
| 3:12:28| Could I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11548)|
| 3:12:29| I think we're discussing the substitute motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| So I would like to make a motion that we go back into normal commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11551)|
| 3:12:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11558)|
| 3:12:39| Clerk, could you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11559)|
| 3:12:44| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11564)|
| 3:12:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11565)|
| 3:12:46| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11566)|
| 3:12:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11567)|
| 3:12:48| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11568)|
| 3:12:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11569)|
| 3:12:50| Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11570)|
| 3:12:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11571)|
| 3:12:52| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11572)|
| 3:12:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11573)|
| 3:12:54| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11574)|
| 3:12:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11575)|
| 3:12:56| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11576)|
| 3:12:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11577)|
| 3:12:58| Commissioner Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11578)|
| 3:12:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| Okay, we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11582)|
| 3:13:03| I don't know who's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11583)|
| 3:13:04| Oh, Commissioner Smith, your light was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11584)|
| 3:13:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11585)|
| 3:13:06| Just for my brothers and sister on commission with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11586)|
| 3:13:09| I don't have a problem with what Chairman Hammond is coming up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| but just reiterate the money that he wants can come out of the budget without a tax increase at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11592)|
| 3:13:21| Go back and readjust, look at what's important to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11601)|
| 3:13:25| and see what they want to pick and pull out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11605)|
| 3:13:28| We can't find four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11608)|
| 3:13:29| Now we're down to four million out of close to 500 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11609)|
| 3:13:34| If they can't do that, that's pretty easy bookkeeping to do, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11614)|
| 3:13:39| I would think there would be less than 1% fat in a $500 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11619)|
| 3:13:43| We can do that without a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| And my proposal does not ask for a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11625)|
| 3:13:48| Just make sure we're clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11628)|
| 3:13:50| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11630)|
| 3:13:51| We're taking it out of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11631)|
| 3:13:52| That's going back into our indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11632)|
| 3:13:56| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11636)|
| 3:13:57| Mr. Chairman, I failed to mention a while ago that at our joint meeting last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11637)|
| 3:14:02| and previous discussions with Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11642)|
| 3:14:07| my suggestion was that they take a couple of programs and put them systemwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11647)|
| 3:14:15| and prove that it every day, every week, every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| whatever it takes to show the voting public that this program is in place and it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11657)|
| 3:14:23| I don't know after the last three or four weeks about a lot of these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11663)|
| 3:14:29| pilot programs that have been very successful in some of these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11669)|
| 3:14:32| But I venture to say that there's people sitting in this audience right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11672)|
| 3:14:36| that don't know about all these programs in some of these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| Take them out and disregard the school system, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11680)|
| 3:14:43| But the lack of communication has not been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11683)|
| 3:14:48| The public does not know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| And they're scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11690)|
| 3:14:52| I would be scared, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| I would have been if I hadn't been able to sit in this seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11694)|
| 3:14:56| and been able to dig in and see what I wanted to do, you know, in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11696)|
| 3:15:03| Figures, you know, you're talking about an 80-page budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11703)|
| 3:15:09| How many people will take the time, how many Knox County voters will take the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11709)|
| 3:15:15| to open that up and dig down there to the sub, sub, sub, sub, sub levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11715)|
| 3:15:19| to get all the information they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11719)|
| 3:15:21| They won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| You need to come out with a bullet point presentation that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11723)|
| 3:15:26| bing, bing, bing, eight or ten items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| This is what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11728)|
| 3:15:30| Then we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11730)|
| 3:15:31| But it's going to have to be proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| Putting a couple of programs in place will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11733)|
| 3:15:36| You've got $13 million already in the increase for the budget for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11736)|
| 3:15:42| another $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11742)|
| 3:15:44| That's $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| That's certainly enough money to be able to put a couple of pilot programs in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11746)|
| 3:15:51| and show the public that this can work and will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11751)|
| 3:15:54| So that's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| Mayor Burchett, do you wish to address council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| I mean commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11759)|
| 3:16:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11761)|
| 3:16:02| Tim Burchett, 9-1-1-8, Westland, county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| I'd like to talk a little bit about the proposal, your proposal, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| I'm afraid it could negatively affect our bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11770)|
| 3:16:14| I don't think we should use our fund balance for reoccurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11774)|
| 3:16:20| And, of course, we have to ask ourselves, where's the funding going to come from next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11780)|
| 3:16:25| This is an example of we have this pot of money over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11785)|
| 3:16:29| It's basically our savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| And we're going to use it for something like salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| And that's you're using one-time money for ongoing expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11794)|
| 3:16:38| I have a real problem with that, and I've stated that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11798)|
| 3:16:42| And we talked about the accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11802)|
| 3:16:45| We're covered under the maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11805)|
| 3:16:46| That's the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| It's through the order of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11808)|
| 3:16:49| It's a court document, and basically it just says that the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11809)|
| 3:16:53| and the commission have no real oversight over the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11813)|
| 3:16:57| If we don't get the outcomes we promised, there's nothing we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11817)|
| 3:17:00| I have a copy of it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11820)|
| 3:17:02| I'm sure Law Director Jarrett can refresh our memory on that if there's any questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11822)|
| 3:17:08| But anything that's put in maintenance of effort, we do not have accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11828)|
| 3:17:13| We cannot pull it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11833)|
| 3:17:14| It's the same money year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11834)|
| 3:17:16| And this is the exact thing that bond rating that these bond rating company councils look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11836)|
| 3:17:23| I don't want to sound petulant, but the truth is, is that this is the very thing they've warned us about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11843)|
| 3:17:29| using one-time money for ongoing expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11849)|
| 3:17:33| They frown less upon property tax increases, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11853)|
| 3:17:38| We're going to endorse your property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11858)|
| 3:17:43| But good try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11863)|
| 3:17:46| But, no, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11866)|
| 3:17:49| And I do appreciate all the school teachers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11869)|
| 3:17:52| I appreciate you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| And I appreciate the ones that I've heard from that were afraid to come here tonight, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11874)|
| 3:17:58| I've heard a lot from them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11878)|
| 3:18:00| So I would hope that we'd look at our AA bond rating that we have and hold that with pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11880)|
| 3:18:06| It doesn't, you know, like I've said before, it's not real sexy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11886)|
| 3:18:09| It's not going to get you reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| And the average citizen doesn't give a rip about it, but you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11891)|
| 3:18:15| That is what we will go when we go to borrow money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| That is where they will set our interest rates at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11898)|
| 3:18:20| And, two, the school system, I believe, is an energy situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11900)|
| 3:18:25| I think looking at maybe a $25 million bond letting next year, I believe in the 2013 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11905)|
| 3:18:32| So I think it's something we need to really look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| And, two, if we're betting on this economy to turn around, let's not fall into that trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11914)|
| 3:18:39| We fell into that trap in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| I spent 16 years there, and I sat in those meetings behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11921)|
| 3:18:46| And they would say things like, man, I've got to run for reelection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11926)|
| 3:18:49| We can't pass a tax next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| And then they'd say, well, let's just readjust our rate of our –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| that we're going to get on the sales tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| And that's exactly what we're doing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| One year it worked, one year it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| And I think you all remember when we closed the university down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| and all the state parks and everything, and that was not –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| that did not look good on our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11947)|
| 3:19:08| So I would ask you to please be very cautious when you talk about spending one-time money for ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11948)|
| 3:19:14| That is not a business-like principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11954)|
| 3:19:16| And I would say anybody in the business community would tell you that that is not a very good –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11956)|
| 3:19:23| that's not a better – that's not an admirable situation to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11963)|
| 3:19:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11967)|
| 3:19:30| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11970)|
| 3:19:33| I think Commissioner Borrell is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11973)|
| 3:19:34| Commissioner Borrell is either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| Well, I respectfully disagree with the mayor on one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11976)|
| 3:19:44| and that is the year we received the double A plus bond rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11984)|
| 3:19:48| we took money out of the general purpose fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11988)|
| 3:19:52| The year we received it, we took money out for county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11992)|
| 3:19:56| I mean, that's a data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| That's the year we received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| And our fund balance is, I would say, significantly higher than that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12000)|
| 3:20:05| So I don't think – in fact, I'm pretty sure that this piece would not downgrade our rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12005)|
| 3:20:17| So that's the one piece that I want to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12017)|
| 3:20:24| To Commissioner Anders' part, so I guess what we – what I like to do with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12024)|
| 3:20:31| what I think we – I heard the law director say is that we need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12031)|
| 3:20:35| The cleanest way is to vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12035)|
| 3:20:39| And if that passes, then we go with additional amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12039)|
| 3:20:43| So that's – I'll turn my line off to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12043)|
| 3:20:46| Commissioner Borrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12046)|
| 3:20:49| Yes, I just wanted to say that, again, that I think what I've appreciated most about this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12049)|
| 3:20:58| is working more closely that the retreat where a lot of this started for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12058)|
| 3:21:05| where we got to work more closely with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12065)|
| 3:21:09| and where we all agreed that what we wanted was to have the best school system in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12069)|
| 3:21:18| And every one of us up here, I think with the exception of maybe a couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12078)|
| 3:21:24| really and truly understand that we need to invest in our educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12084)|
| 3:21:33| We just have some differences of opinion on exactly how and when that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12093)|
| 3:21:38| But we all are agreed on the end goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12098)|
| 3:21:42| And so what's important to me is that we take this first step, this very important first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12102)|
| 3:21:51| and then we need to think about how do we all come together and move forward from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12111)|
| 3:21:58| And I think that we're in a really good place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12118)|
| 3:22:01| This has been a wonderful experience in citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12121)|
| 3:22:07| I've never seen anything like this, this grassroots, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12127)|
| 3:22:15| organization, campaign that's come together that it's not just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| a group of Sequoia Hills moms coming together or senior citizens coming together to push this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12138)|
| 3:22:27| This is the most broad-based, diverse coalition I've ever seen come together in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12147)|
| 3:22:35| And I think that's impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| And so I hope that you're congratulating yourselves because I'm so impressed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12157)|
| 3:22:44| And I'm impressed with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12164)|
| 3:22:45| So I hope that we can take this important first step and then we can come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12165)|
| 3:22:50| and move forward together to do what's best for our entire school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12170)|
| 3:22:55| and to elevate our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12178)|
| 3:23:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12180)|
| 3:23:04| Smith doesn't want to be in the same picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12184)|
| 3:23:12| Knox County has been at the budget process for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12192)|
| 3:23:15| Individual departments have been coming up with what they should think their budget should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12195)|
| 3:23:23| The mayor, the school board, the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12203)|
| 3:23:26| everyone has worked for several weeks at determining what cash flow might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12206)|
| 3:23:33| what the needs are, and where we stand with what we have in our proposed checking account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12213)|
| 3:23:43| Commissioner McKenzie a moment ago or a few minutes ago, I made the note, he used the term 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12223)|
| 3:23:54| Commissioner Norman didn't use the term 11th hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12234)|
| 3:23:58| but maybe insinuated that we're trying to accomplish things here whenever we may not have thought about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12238)|
| 3:24:06| or we may not have had input from the people we support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12246)|
| 3:24:11| The constituents that I have in the 8th District have wore my answering machine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12251)|
| 3:24:18| and my cell phone minutes out just like everyone else sitting here on commission has received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12258)|
| 3:24:24| This has generated more contact than any issue that's been before us in the last three years of new commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12264)|
| 3:24:35| I'll also continue on by saying I agree with Commissioner McKenzie that technology is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12275)|
| 3:24:41| I never did figure out how to use that slide rule in 1964| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12281)|
| 3:24:45| or whenever it was I was supposed to have figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| And whenever I was back 20 years later, it was in a high-dollar electronic device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12288)|
| 3:24:58| But the thing that is before us tonight is how much cash flow we think we're going to have next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12298)|
| 3:25:04| and how we're going to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12304)|
| 3:25:06| I think it would have, as the law director commented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12306)|
| 3:25:10| been best to vote on the straightforward budget as consolidated by the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12310)|
| 3:25:19| and then we could have gone into the tackling of things that we as commission feel like maybe should be added to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12319)|
| 3:25:31| So looking at it from the way I'm looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12331)|
| 3:25:36| I believe that taking from fund balance to fund this initial amended budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12336)|
| 3:25:43| or substitute budget, whichever it is, will not be something that I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12343)|
| 3:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12351)|
| 3:25:52| Let me make a final comment and then we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12352)|
| 3:25:55| I did not enter into this flippantly or with my eyes closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12355)|
| 3:26:00| I'm concerned about our fund balance, our bond rating, all of those things for one simple reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12360)|
| 3:26:05| It's my money, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| And I'm very concerned about how my money is spent just like I'm concerned about how all of your money is being spent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12367)|
| 3:26:14| As I looked at our available fund balance, we have $43 million in the Knox County General Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12374)|
| 3:26:21| The number is, what, $27 million, I believe, with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12381)|
| 3:26:25| We know that revenues are about $21 million ahead so far this year with two more months to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12385)|
| 3:26:32| sales tax and property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12392)|
| 3:26:34| But above and beyond that, we talk about next year, we've got a Costco coming to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12394)|
| 3:26:39| Now, when you look at the revenue that is generated from a Costco, they tell me that it's $140 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12399)|
| 3:26:45| That's the average Costco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12405)|
| 3:26:46| The average Sam's is $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12406)|
| 3:26:49| We're looking at attracting a lot of people from outside the area into this Costco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12409)|
| 3:26:54| I believe that we're going to see benefit from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12414)|
| 3:26:56| And I believe we'll see $1.5 million in benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| I also believe that we're going to see benefit from the new Publix that are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12419)|
| 3:27:03| I think we're going to see benefit from the new Walmart that's going to be coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12423)|
| 3:27:06| In other words, you look at the opportunities that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12426)|
| 3:27:09| I believe that we are in a very, very good shape to fund these and to go ahead and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12429)|
| 3:27:17| And I think that people will look at us and say, these people value education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12437)|
| 3:27:22| They're putting money into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12442)|
| 3:27:23| They're having these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12443)|
| 3:27:25| And I think that they're going to view that very, very positively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12445)|
| 3:27:29| Thank you, Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12449)|
| 3:27:32| Yeah, I didn't come into this very lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12452)|
| 3:27:34| Really, from day one of this whole plan, I was probably one of the most adamant people against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12454)|
| 3:27:39| And doing some research and doing some thinking on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12459)|
| 3:27:44| and really investing a lot of my time, as I should have been, into this program and into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12464)|
| 3:27:51| There are still things that Dr. McIntyre and I disagree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12471)|
| 3:27:55| I don't believe that we need to add a week of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12475)|
| 3:27:57| I don't believe that there's certain programs that we don't need to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12477)|
| 3:28:02| But we're taking, I think, one of the most important things that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12482)|
| 3:28:06| We're taking a literacy plan that's been a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12486)|
| 3:28:10| And we've thought well enough of it to fund it for the whole county or for more schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12490)|
| 3:28:16| And we're going to have results from that pilot program in the next year or the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12496)|
| 3:28:21| So the reason that I support this compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12501)|
| 3:28:24| and Commissioner Norman and I have great respect for his history at the school system and his knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12504)|
| 3:28:31| but when you say you need to send a message to the school board, they've asked for $35 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12511)|
| 3:28:36| We're sending them 20 percent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| I think that's a message that we don't fully believe in the plan enough to risk a revolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12519)|
| 3:28:51| But we understand that there's a need in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12531)|
| 3:28:54| And so using the soundbites, it's very discouraging that we have divided this community using soundbites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12534)|
| 3:29:03| and headlines when we should have a common goal of making sure that our children are educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12543)|
| 3:29:10| And just to throw out that, you know, we talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12550)|
| 3:29:19| I'm not going to say anything because I thought this plan was very good and I thought it would pass hands down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12559)|
| 3:29:27| But when we talk about technology and we talk about investment where every kid came out, that is so far from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12567)|
| 3:29:37| If you all would let me speak, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12577)|
| 3:29:41| I do appreciate the applause, but I don't get that much at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12581)|
| 3:29:48| The thing about the technology is in 2015, our school, our TCAP tests are going to be replaced with an electronic test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12588)|
| 3:29:56| There's no more Scantrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12596)|
| 3:29:59| There's no more hand grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| There's no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12601)|
| 3:30:02| It's going to be electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12602)|
| 3:30:03| The state's mandated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12603)|
| 3:30:04| And I've talked to Ryan Haynes, and he knows that they've passed on an unfunded mandate by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12604)|
| 3:30:09| But get our schools to the ability to take these tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12609)|
| 3:30:13| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12613)|
| 3:30:14| Are we going to call Sylvan Learning Center and rent out the convention center and take our kids down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12614)|
| 3:30:18| What are we going to do to take those tests if we don't have the infrastructure in our schools for technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12618)|
| 3:30:23| And when we talk about, you know, I just so happen, an old friend that I hadn't seen in a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12623)|
| 3:30:32| was invited with a group that I played golf with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12632)|
| 3:30:36| and he just so happens to work for one of the textbook companies, McGraw Hill, I believe, one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12636)|
| 3:30:41| And I talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12641)|
| 3:30:42| I said, how far are we away from having the ability for every textbook in our county to be electronic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12642)|
| 3:30:49| He said, you could do it now if the state of Tennessee would allow you to change your curriculum somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12649)|
| 3:30:55| But this next textbook purchase may and should be our very last textbook purchase in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12655)|
| 3:31:04| Greenville City Schools, I have a cousin that just graduated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12664)|
| 3:31:07| I've got two more cousins that are in the Greenville system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12667)|
| 3:31:11| She had one or two textbooks all year, and she's an advanced AP student with a 4.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12671)|
| 3:31:19| And everything that she had was on a tablet of some kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12679)|
| 3:31:22| So to say that it's an iPad for every kid to play with or for, you know, that is --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12682)|
| 3:31:28| It's a sound bot that makes the plan look foolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12688)|
| 3:31:33| And I think we need to agree on the things that we agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12693)|
| 3:31:38| and the things that we disagree on, find a compromise, and find a way to make our schools better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12698)|
| 3:31:43| Because schools, infrastructure, everything drives economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12703)|
| 3:31:50| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12710)|
| 3:31:51| There is nobody and there's no person that is a headhunter for their living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12711)|
| 3:31:59| will tell you that education is not important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12719)|
| 3:32:02| If they do, they're an unemployed headhunter for locating businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12722)|
| 3:32:09| So taking the sound bots out of this and taking the plan from $35 million to $7 million with no tax increase is a good way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12729)|
| 3:32:18| to start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12738)|
| 3:32:20| And my commitment to this next year is, number one, I've already talked to Representative Haynes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12740)|
| 3:32:25| We're going to have delegation meetings and we're going to have discussions about how to capture some of the leftover lottery money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12745)|
| 3:32:31| how to capture some of the potential excess revenue from the state this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12751)|
| 3:32:37| And so we need to have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12757)|
| 3:32:38| They're not going to promise us anything, but we need to let the state know that we're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12758)|
| 3:32:43| And number two, I think that this plan needs to be continually reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12763)|
| 3:32:49| and make sure that this next year that the commissioners --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12769)|
| 3:32:52| I didn't spend the time that some of these commissioners have spent in these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12772)|
| 3:32:56| but I'm committed to spending time in all of my schools more so than ever because this plan is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12776)|
| 3:33:02| And so with that, I hope that you will support this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12782)|
| 3:33:07| We have a substitute motion on the floor to increase the school funding by $4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12787)|
| 3:33:12| $1 million coming from anticipated BEP funding, 1.5 million from Knox County's general fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12792)|
| 3:33:18| 1.5 million from Knox County Schools fund balance should it be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12798)|
| 3:33:22| Part of this motion is to ask the county finance director to report to us in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12802)|
| 3:33:26| and August about available revenues that may be available with regards to our end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12806)|
| 3:33:33| and any excess revenues that we may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| So that is the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12815)|
| 3:33:36| We will have a roll call beginning in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12816)|
| 3:33:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12820)|
| 3:33:44| You always start with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12824)|
| 3:33:45| You all have me in a real pickle here in terms of, you know, where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12825)|
| 3:33:50| You know, it's kind of like the they don't have ties in college football anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12830)|
| 3:33:55| but I know coaches used to say, you know, this feels kind of like kissing your sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12835)|
| 3:34:02| But I'm going to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12842)|
| 3:34:06| Just to be clear, that $3 million is on goes to maintenance of effort, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12846)|
| 3:34:12| Yes, it's $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12852)|
| 3:34:13| The $3 million from the mayor is a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| He's talking about the $3 million from the legislature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12855)|
| 3:34:17| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12857)|
| 3:34:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12858)|
| 3:34:20| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12860)|
| 3:34:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12861)|
| 3:34:23| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12863)|
| 3:34:24| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12864)|
| 3:34:25| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12865)|
| 3:34:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12866)|
| 3:34:27| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12867)|
| 3:34:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12868)|
| 3:34:29| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12869)|
| 3:34:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12870)|
| 3:34:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12871)|
| 3:34:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12872)|
| 3:34:33| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12873)|
| 3:34:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12874)|
| 3:34:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12875)|
| 3:34:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12876)|
| 3:34:37| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12877)|
| 3:34:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12878)|
| 3:34:39| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12879)|
| 3:34:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12880)|
| 3:34:44| The vote is seven ayes, four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12884)|
| 3:34:47| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12887)|
| 3:34:57| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12897)|
| 3:34:58| I'd like to make a motion to amend kind of the resolution of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12898)|
| 3:35:05| Two years ago, the mayor, Mayor Burchett, did some serious cuts that were necessary to balance the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12905)|
| 3:35:17| and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| But this year, he's the economic development side of our county dollars are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12919)|
| 3:35:25| I sit on the county development corporation board and we have parks that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12925)|
| 3:35:34| parks to maintain, things that need to be facilities that they own and things that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12934)|
| 3:35:41| And I'm going to ask that the current, it's a $185,000 difference from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12941)|
| 3:35:48| he has proposed a cut of $185,000 to Innovation Valley, the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12948)|
| 3:35:54| and the development corporation from this year's funding from already a 25% cut the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12954)|
| 3:36:00| I would ask that amendment be made to restore the $185,000 and to also separate the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12960)|
| 3:36:07| And there's a reason I want to separate the contracts for Innovation Valley from the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12967)|
| 3:36:12| I believe that separating the contracts allows us a clearer picture of where the money is being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12972)|
| 3:36:17| If we put the money into the chamber and they have to separate it for Innovation Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12977)|
| 3:36:22| I believe it creates another layer of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12982)|
| 3:36:26| And so if they're separated, I'd rather do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12986)|
| 3:36:29| So my amendment request would be $185,000 restored to chamber, development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12989)|
| 3:36:40| and Innovation Valley and separate them into previous contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13000)|
| 3:36:43| And that funding would come from, and I've spoken to Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13003)|
| 3:36:49| the funding would hopefully come from closeout for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13009)|
| 3:36:52| which we always have at least, I think, $600,000 or $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13012)|
| 3:36:55| We've had up to $1.5 million in closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13015)|
| 3:36:58| And if not, that $185,000 would come from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13018)|
| 3:37:02| The reason that I make this motion is that when we look to build Carter School, which I've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13022)|
| 3:37:09| I fully supported the mayor in his effort to build that school because I believe it was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13029)|
| 3:37:13| And I still believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| We didn't want the PBA to touch it and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13035)|
| 3:37:19| We had control of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13039)|
| 3:37:20| And so who did we call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13040)|
| 3:37:21| We called the development corporation to facilitate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13041)|
| 3:37:24| And so then to turn around and to slash their funding after we asked them to build us a school is a contradiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13044)|
| 3:37:31| of what we need them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13051)|
| 3:37:32| So that's the reason I propose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13052)|
| 3:37:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13054)|
| 3:37:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13055)|
| 3:37:36| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13056)|
| 3:37:37| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13057)|
| 3:37:38| Yeah, I'd like to speak to this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13058)|
| 3:37:40| I know tonight there's things that we have agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13060)|
| 3:37:43| Everybody agrees that we need to have better schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13063)|
| 3:37:46| Where the disagreement comes is how are we going to pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13066)|
| 3:37:49| And, you know, we've talked about cutting budgets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| We've talked about not raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13072)|
| 3:37:55| The best way for our community to move forward and not have to raise taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13075)|
| 3:38:01| and we've also heard today from people who don't have jobs that are looking for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13081)|
| 3:38:07| We've heard from people whose children excelled in school, fortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13087)|
| 3:38:11| They went to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13091)|
| 3:38:12| They developed very high skills, but they're leaving the community to go someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13092)|
| 3:38:18| Not only to find jobs, but to pay their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13098)|
| 3:38:22| What we need to do is to bring into this community the good jobs that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13102)|
| 3:38:28| The best way to keep our taxes down and to have better schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13108)|
| 3:38:32| and not have to stress the elderly and not have to stress the people that don't have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13112)|
| 3:38:38| to pay their taxes is to have a higher tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13118)|
| 3:38:42| And you do that by recruiting industry into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| And it's the Development Corporation and the IDC and the Chamber of Commerce that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13126)|
| 3:38:54| We can talk about the different businesses that we've lost since we've maybe not been as friendly to businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13134)|
| 3:39:00| as we can, but also if you look at what we see in the U.S. News and World Report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13140)|
| 3:39:04| and what we see in the business reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13144)|
| 3:39:06| we're starting to appear on the radar of some of the most business-friendly states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13146)|
| 3:39:12| and Knoxville is one of the most business-friendly communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13152)|
| 3:39:15| And we need to continue along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13155)|
| 3:39:17| This is a chance to take advantage of some of our other states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13157)|
| 3:39:20| and other communities that haven't been able to finance these like we should and like we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13160)|
| 3:39:27| And rather than looking to cut, cut, cut or to tax, tax, tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13167)|
| 3:39:35| I say let's grow, grow, grow and avoid all of those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13175)|
| 3:39:38| And I'd like to speak very strongly to support this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13178)|
| 3:39:42| and hope that we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13182)|
| 3:39:45| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13185)|
| 3:39:46| I don't have an input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13186)|
| 3:39:48| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13188)|
| 3:39:49| No, pardon me, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| Anybody here from the Chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13191)|
| 3:39:55| Ms. Rice is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13195)|
| 3:39:57| Rhonda's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| Is Todd here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13199)|
| 3:40:02| Rhonda Rice is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13202)|
| 3:40:10| Where is your boss at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13210)|
| 3:40:13| Right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| We prefer to hear from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13215)|
| 3:40:18| My chairman is right there, so that's the one I was actually pointing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13218)|
| 3:40:21| I agree with what Dr. Briggs has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13221)|
| 3:40:25| And, Rhonda, as you know, I'm in sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13225)|
| 3:40:27| I've been doing sales for 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| And this is just perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13229)|
| 3:40:31| So before I can vote on this tonight and feel comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| I need for you guys to make me feel comfortable with what have you brought to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13234)|
| 3:40:39| I understand why Brad wants to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| But I'll be honest with you, Rhonda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| the last thing I remember that you all brought was Green Mountain Coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13243)|
| 3:40:46| And you all get some pretty nice salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13246)|
| 3:40:48| And you're in sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13248)|
| 3:40:49| And the problem I've got with it is you men and women, you get paid your high salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13249)|
| 3:40:54| whether you sell something to Knox County or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13254)|
| 3:40:57| And it seems like we've been going for years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| And I know it's the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13259)|
| 3:41:00| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13260)|
| 3:41:02| But I don't know if we're throwing money again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13262)|
| 3:41:05| And I agree with what Dr. Briggs said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13265)|
| 3:41:07| It's a cheap way for us to get some money in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13267)|
| 3:41:11| But as a salesman, I don't see anything that you all are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13271)|
| 3:41:16| And, Rhonda, you know more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13276)|
| 3:41:18| So if you can make me feel better about what you all have actually brought to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13278)|
| 3:41:22| I mean, we had K-Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13282)|
| 3:41:23| We lost that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13283)|
| 3:41:24| I thought we were going to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| But, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13286)|
| 3:41:27| We lost that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13290)|
| 3:41:31| Go ahead, Rhonda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13291)|
| 3:41:32| Well, I don't know whether I can make you feel better or not, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| but I can state the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13294)|
| 3:41:36| I can talk about what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13296)|
| 3:41:38| And the first thing, if you're in sales, the first thing you know is that you never cut your marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13298)|
| 3:41:43| The first thing you've got to do is get in front of your customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| and you've got to make sure that you're sending that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13305)|
| 3:41:48| We have already eliminated an amount of funding based on the proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13308)|
| 3:41:54| to reduce our marketing strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13314)|
| 3:41:56| Green Mountain Coffee is the last new company that we have announced in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13316)|
| 3:42:02| What year was that, Rhonda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13322)|
| 3:42:04| That was in 2008, and it was 350 jobs at a $36 million investment at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13324)|
| 3:42:10| And they're doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13330)|
| 3:42:11| They are currently at over 900 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13331)|
| 3:42:14| and have expanded up to their third and looking at a fourth time at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13334)|
| 3:42:18| And we can talk about new companies all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13338)|
| 3:42:22| but we wouldn't be having 900 jobs at Green Mountain in those expansions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13342)|
| 3:42:26| if they hadn't gotten here in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13346)|
| 3:42:28| So you have to keep the pipeline full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13348)|
| 3:42:30| You have to stay on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13350)|
| 3:42:32| At Ocean Valley, we have a very strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13352)|
| 3:42:34| It's not a shotgun approach that we go out there and just go willy-nilly and go after something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13354)|
| 3:42:39| We know where the projects are, and we try to make them happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13359)|
| 3:42:43| But I can tell you there are a lot of circumstances that cause companies not to look at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13363)|
| 3:42:50| not having the right available land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13370)|
| 3:42:52| not having the ability to make a deal that would be successful for their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13372)|
| 3:42:57| Those types of things play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13377)|
| 3:43:00| Also coming into play is their perception of a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13380)|
| 3:43:04| And we have to make sure that they know that we are business friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13384)|
| 3:43:07| and that when they move here and their employees here and their kids here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13387)|
| 3:43:10| that this is going to be a great place for them to grow their families and their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13390)|
| 3:43:14| And so all those things are a component to what we are trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13394)|
| 3:43:18| We have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13398)|
| 3:43:19| The Innovation Valley budget is 54 percent funded by the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13399)|
| 3:43:25| City of Knoxville, Blount County, Oak Ridge, Rhone, and Loudon County are all funders of this program now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13405)|
| 3:43:34| They have been from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13414)|
| 3:43:36| And if you have a regional program and you have regional participants from your other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13416)|
| 3:43:41| you want to make sure that Knox County is a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13421)|
| 3:43:45| I mean, we're the leader in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13425)|
| 3:43:46| We need to be a player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13426)|
| 3:43:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13428)|
| 3:43:49| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13429)|
| 3:43:50| What is this money going for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13430)|
| 3:43:51| Maybe you or Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13431)|
| 3:43:52| Where are you going to use this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| The money that would come back is, if I understand Commissioner Anders' amendment, is the total is $185,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13434)|
| 3:44:03| What is in the current budget is $120,000 to the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13443)|
| 3:44:08| The two contracts that he recognized and said the previous contracts would go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13448)|
| 3:44:13| there were two separate contracts, one for the Chamber of Commerce for $80,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13453)|
| 3:44:18| and one for Innovation Valley for $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13458)|
| 3:44:22| So what we would do is we would take that money and do as suggested, split it into two contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13462)|
| 3:44:27| The money could be used for global marketing and marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13467)|
| 3:44:30| whether it's face-to-face meetings with these site consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13470)|
| 3:44:33| whether it's getting Knox County's name out there in front of the right business decision makers that they need to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13473)|
| 3:44:38| whether it's education and workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13478)|
| 3:44:40| And just this summer we found out this morning we've got 90 teachers that are going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13480)|
| 3:44:45| the educators in the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13485)|
| 3:44:46| There are businesses all over this region that are willing to bring those teachers in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13486)|
| 3:44:50| These things don't happen without us pushing and making them happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13490)|
| 3:44:54| So I can give you a complete, you know, array of activities that we would use the funding for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13494)|
| 3:45:00| Is it going for keeping some of the people still on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13500)|
| 3:45:03| or what percentage of its salary and what percentage of it is going to be in marketing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13503)|
| 3:45:06| That's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13506)|
| 3:45:07| None of the money that Knox County provides goes to salaries at the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13507)|
| 3:45:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13514)|
| 3:45:15| Todd, that pretty much ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13515)|
| 3:45:16| Unless you have anything, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13516)|
| 3:45:18| Todd can offer a little bit on the development corporation side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13518)|
| 3:45:21| The development corporation is really a service organization that manages fixed assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13521)|
| 3:45:26| and programs for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13526)|
| 3:45:29| You know, we have five business parks that we manage plus some additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| Those are just hard costs that have to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| We manage Knox County's Fairview Technology Center, you know, run the industrial development boards and staff those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13536)|
| 3:45:44| We get a little bit of money, but it's not enough, truthfully, to run those organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13544)|
| 3:45:49| So, you know, they're just hard costs that it takes to operate those organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13549)|
| 3:45:54| Are your people bonused in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13554)|
| 3:45:56| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13556)|
| 3:45:57| They don't do anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13557)|
| 3:45:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13558)|
| 3:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13559)|
| 3:46:01| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13563)|
| 3:46:05| I'd like to offer a substitute motion that we postpone this for one month just to take a look at these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13565)|
| 3:46:15| you know, these funding sources, revenue matters that the chamber has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13575)|
| 3:46:19| I have questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| I don't think it would be wise to do this kind of on the fly tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13581)|
| 3:46:26| I think we need to investigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13586)|
| 3:46:28| So that's my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13588)|
| 3:46:32| My substitute motion is for this amendment to be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13592)|
| 3:46:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13599)|
| 3:46:40| The motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13600)|
| 3:46:42| Commissioner McKenzie, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13602)|
| 3:46:45| So the substitute motion on the floor is to defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13605)|
| 3:46:49| And I want to be clear, we're only deferring this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13609)|
| 3:46:52| We're not deferring the budget, just this item in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13612)|
| 3:46:55| So we have to do a roll call on all budget items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13615)|
| 3:46:59| So let's start again with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13621)|

| 3:47:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13634)|
| 3:47:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13636)|
| 3:47:17| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13637)|
| 3:47:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13638)|

| 3:47:23| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13643)|
| 3:47:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13644)|
| 3:47:25| Substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13645)|
| 3:47:26| We're going to go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13646)|
| 3:47:28| And did anyone want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13648)|
| 3:47:31| What's the total again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13651)|
| 3:47:32| $185,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13652)|
| 3:47:33| $185,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| It takes it to current years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13655)|
| 3:47:37| Whatever the current year and the current contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| the two contracts, splitting the contracts so we can keep the money separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13659)|
| 3:47:43| So that is the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13663)|
| 3:47:44| It's been properly made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13664)|
| 3:47:46| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13666)|

| 3:48:07| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13687)|

| 3:48:09| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13689)|
| 3:48:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13690)|
| 3:48:11| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13691)|
| 3:48:13| Yes and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13693)|
| 3:48:20| The vote is nine ayes, two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13700)|
| 3:48:22| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13702)|
| 3:48:27| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13707)|
| 3:48:28| Commissioner Brolles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13708)|
| 3:48:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13714)|
| 3:48:35| I think Sam had his light on first, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13715)|
| 3:48:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13717)|
| 3:48:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13718)|
| 3:48:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13719)|
| 3:48:40| I've been on a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13720)|
| 3:48:41| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13721)|
| 3:48:42| You've been on for 30 minutes, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13722)|
| 3:48:47| I'm going to be brief on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| And let me first say that I want to speak to Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13730)|
| 3:48:54| And I actually asked Mr. Rollins, Avon Rollins, I told him that he did not have to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13734)|
| 3:49:00| He sent me information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13740)|
| 3:49:01| If anyone has any questions about what I'm proposing, I have information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13741)|
| 3:49:07| So the reason he's not here is that I asked him not to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13747)|
| 3:49:12| But I'm going to ask for an extremely modest amount of money for Beck Center this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13752)|
| 3:49:19| I think the, you know, the commissioner has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13759)|
| 3:49:22| The mayor has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13762)|
| 3:49:23| But what I'd like to do is just give them a little bit of keep float money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13763)|
| 3:49:31| We can do it via there's already a memorandum of agreement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13771)|
| 3:49:37| So there's an instrument in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13777)|
| 3:49:39| They can submit quarterly receipts for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| Again, it's a fairly small amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13781)|
| 3:49:45| And as to talk about how it's funded, again, it's a small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13785)|
| 3:49:49| I do think it can be funded out of the year-end piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13789)|
| 3:49:53| But, again, not to belabor the point, last year we sat here, a lot of uncertainty around Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13793)|
| 3:50:00| This year there's no uncertainty about how they're spending the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13800)|
| 3:50:03| They're spending even a lot less this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13803)|
| 3:50:06| They are still able to keep their doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13806)|
| 3:50:08| And, you know, they've cut staff and they won't add any staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13808)|
| 3:50:13| And none of these funds will go for salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13813)|
| 3:50:15| These are all operating expenses, you know, security or repairs or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13815)|
| 3:50:26| some of the other maintenance of effort just to keep the lights on type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13826)|
| 3:50:31| But I'd like to make a motion that we increase funding $50,000 for Beck Culture Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13831)|
| 3:50:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13840)|
| 3:50:41| The motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13841)|
| 3:50:43| And if anyone has questions on detail on the budget, I do have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13843)|
| 3:50:47| Commissioner Norman, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13847)|
| 3:50:50| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13850)|
| 3:50:51| Yeah, Sam, I was expecting the $1,205,000 that the Blount Mansion and all that stuff got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13851)|
| 3:50:58| Is that what we did this year for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13858)|
| 3:51:01| Hey, Grant, can I borrow you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13861)|
| 3:51:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13864)|
| 3:51:06| Commissioners, while he's coming forward, I don't know how many more amendments you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13866)|
| 3:51:10| But just remember, the code does specify that you have to ensure that the revenues are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13870)|
| 3:51:17| to maintain a balanced budget and the funds have not already been encumbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13877)|
| 3:51:21| So, I mean, before we start amending that budget, just make sure you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13881)|
| 3:51:26| I don't mind waiting until those funds, until those numbers come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13886)|
| 3:51:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13889)|
| 3:51:30| Can we talk about this after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13890)|
| 3:51:31| Because how much did we give Blount Mansion and James White Fort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13891)|
| 3:51:35| Was it $1,205,000 again this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13895)|
| 3:51:37| $1,200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13897)|
| 3:51:38| I would, Sam, if you don't care, I'd rather wait until then because there were other people that failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13898)|
| 3:51:44| to hit all the deadlines, and I just want to make sure we're doing the right thing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13904)|
| 3:51:48| if you don't mind to wait 30 days or to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13908)|
| 3:51:54| I just want to make sure that, you know, I guess I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13914)|
| 3:52:04| Are you offering that as a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13924)|
| 3:52:07| I don't want to have a discussion with Sam first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13927)|
| 3:52:10| Why the 50, I guess, versus it being treated like the Blount Mansion type stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13930)|
| 3:52:18| You know, and again, I don't want to rehash everything, but there are a lot more activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13938)|
| 3:52:24| It's not a historic house where people walk through and see the historic significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13944)|
| 3:52:29| They're actually programs for the youth and for seniors that are held there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13949)|
| 3:52:33| So, you know, it's kind of a different beast than the regular historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13953)|
| 3:52:38| In fact, there was a fundraiser this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13958)|
| 3:52:40| I think Chrissy Haslam chaired for the historic homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13960)|
| 3:52:43| and Beck wasn't part of it for the reason that Beck really isn't, you know, simply just a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13963)|
| 3:52:48| So that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13968)|
| 3:52:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13970)|
| 3:52:53| Mr. Bross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13973)|
| 3:53:01| So your motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13981)|
| 3:53:04| It's an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13984)|
| 3:53:07| Mr. Jarrett, could I say it this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| Tell me if I'm incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13989)|
| 3:53:11| Pending a positive, after we've had the one amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13991)|
| 3:53:15| pending a positive year-end cash flow of $50,000 that we would allocate $50,000 in terms of what do you call that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=13995)|
| 3:53:27| Will you turn in the receipts, recoverable expenses to the Beck Culture Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14007)|
| 3:53:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14014)|
| 3:53:35| My only concern, again, I wasn't sure if there's going to be multiple amendments to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14015)|
| 3:53:38| so it's not specific as to your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14018)|
| 3:53:40| Just we have to ensure you don't want to commit something for which the funding isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14020)|
| 3:53:44| If it's not there, it's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14024)|
| 3:53:49| That's all I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14029)|
| 3:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14030)|
| 3:53:51| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14031)|
| 3:53:52| My second motion is after closeout year-end that Beck will be given up to $50,000 pending receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14032)|
| 3:53:59| submitted to purchasing or whoever, whatever department handles that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14039)|
| 3:54:04| So your motion is up to $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14044)|
| 3:54:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14046)|
| 3:54:08| And there was a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14048)|
| 3:54:10| Commissioner Bross, you seconded that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14050)|
| 3:54:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14051)|
| 3:54:12| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14052)|
| 3:54:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14053)|
| 3:54:14| Just as a reminder, there was more than one who got their requests in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14054)|
| 3:54:25| I think it might be prudent to wait until we get this year-end figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14065)|
| 3:54:31| and then if there's any funds left, then we can take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14071)|
| 3:54:35| But all of these are good programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14075)|
| 3:54:37| And there's a couple of other good programs that because of the way that things were changed this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14077)|
| 3:54:43| I mean, it's a little more complex, the procedures they had to go through to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14083)|
| 3:54:50| It wasn't like it's been in before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14090)|
| 3:54:51| It didn't necessarily fill out one sheet and it went to a committee and blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14091)|
| 3:54:56| So it was a whole different process and the way it was rated and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| So there was more than one waiting in the wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14100)|
| 3:55:03| And I think it would be wise for us to wait and take a look at those as a package deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14103)|
| 3:55:08| when we got some year-end figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14108)|
| 3:55:11| Yes, you wish to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14111)|
| 3:55:13| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14113)|
| 3:55:14| Grant Rosenberg, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14114)|
| 3:55:17| I just have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14117)|
| 3:55:18| I'd like to ask for a little clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14118)|
| 3:55:21| You mentioned receipts being turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14121)|
| 3:55:23| Are you talking about invoices being submitted to our department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14123)|
| 3:55:26| Are you talking about collections, like tax collections and revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14126)|
| 3:55:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14129)|
| 3:55:30| I'm saying if this is a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14130)|
| 3:55:32| I'm sorry for the confusion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14132)|
| 3:55:34| I'm saying that if at the end of the day, I'm putting a layman's term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14134)|
| 3:55:38| end of year-end closeout, after this $185,000, there's $50,000 left that we set up that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14138)|
| 3:55:44| and that BEC would not receive funds until they submitted an invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14144)|
| 3:55:48| And we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14148)|
| 3:55:49| You all can do it quarterly, monthly, or as they come in, however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14149)|
| 3:55:58| So we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14158)|
| 3:55:59| Yes, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14159)|
| 3:56:00| I just wanted to make sure that this was going to make sure that I had this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14160)|
| 3:56:03| And when you're talking about submitting invoices, you're talking about because this is what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14163)|
| 3:56:07| intend for this money to go for is for, like, KUB bills, like, you know, water, all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14167)|
| 3:56:15| You're not talking about so that's what you mean when you say submitting invoices on a quarterly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14175)|
| 3:56:22| and they would be paid at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14182)|
| 3:56:24| It wouldn't be giving a lump sum to BEC for them to pay out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14184)|
| 3:56:30| It would be they submit their receipts for these operating expenses, and they would be paid at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14190)|
| 3:56:38| Everybody who's under this grants program has to do that the same way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14198)|
| 3:56:42| They have to turn those receipts in like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14202)|
| 3:56:45| Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that they were in line with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14207)|
| 3:56:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14208)|
| 3:56:49| Funding coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14209)|
| 3:56:51| Is it coming from the fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14211)|
| 3:56:54| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14214)|
| 3:56:56| I mean, well, prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14216)|
| 3:57:00| It's coming from the same, as we talked about, as Commissioner Andrews discussed, that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14220)|
| 3:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14227)|
| 3:57:08| Closeout funds, the one he discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14228)|
| 3:57:11| Closeouts are getting low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14231)|
| 3:57:12| I mean, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14232)|
| 3:57:13| If we're going $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14233)|
| 3:57:15| Again, now, if we don't have closeout funds at the end of the day, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14235)|
| 3:57:19| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14241)|
| 3:57:22| I'm not saying fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14242)|
| 3:57:24| I'm really trying to get this thing passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14244)|
| 3:57:26| I'm saying in closeouts, at the end of the day, you've done the spending to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14246)|
| 3:57:33| I don't know about afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14253)|
| 3:57:34| To this point, if you don't have $50,000, then all bets are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14254)|
| 3:57:37| I'm not saying dip in the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| So you're saying if there's no funding left, then zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14259)|
| 3:57:42| Then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14262)|
| 3:57:43| But, I mean, please don't pencil whip that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14263)|
| 3:57:46| You sound pretty excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14266)|
| 3:57:48| You were walking away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14268)|
| 3:57:49| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14269)|
| 3:57:50| But, no, I think that there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14270)|
| 3:57:53| There will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14273)|
| 3:57:54| But I'm not saying pull out a fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14274)|
| 3:57:58| That is not what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14278)|
| 3:57:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14279)|
| 3:58:00| I got my pen, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14280)|
| 3:58:01| It's not a pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14281)|
| 3:58:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14283)|
| 3:58:04| Grant, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14284)|
| 3:58:06| How many non-profits do we give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14286)|
| 3:58:08| We normally give, what, 12,000 to non-profits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14288)|
| 3:58:11| Is that what you're doing this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14291)|
| 3:58:13| Each agency varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14293)|
| 3:58:14| Each amount that goes to an agency varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14294)|
| 3:58:18| I couldn't write them all off for you, but you mentioned 12,000 historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14298)|
| 3:58:22| Traditionally, we've gotten 12,000 each year for capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14302)|
| 3:58:25| This year, there's actually a little bit more in the budget for historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14305)|
| 3:58:30| Keep in mind, a lot of those contracts are funded out of the hotel motel tax funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14310)|
| 3:58:34| So this would be something that sounds like it would have to come out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14314)|
| 3:58:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14319)|
| 3:58:43| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14323)|
| 3:58:46| We will need to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14326)|
| 3:58:49| Yes, Commissioner Briggs, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14329)|
| 3:58:50| I just want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14330)|
| 3:58:52| I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14332)|
| 3:58:53| We've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14333)|
| 3:58:54| What is the motion exactly again, and where is the money coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14334)|
| 3:58:58| Commissioner, would you restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14338)|
| 3:59:06| Why wasn't there confusion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14346)|
| 3:59:07| Brad, could you state that fund again so I could get the words to where the commissioners are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14347)|
| 3:59:11| understanding this, because I must not be saying it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14351)|
| 3:59:14| I think it's the motion is to award the $50,000 to the Beck Cultural Center pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14354)|
| 3:59:21| There's $50,000 left after closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14361)|
| 3:59:24| No general fund reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14364)|
| 3:59:26| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14366)|
| 3:59:27| That's what I thought I was saying from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14367)|
| 3:59:31| You're in closeout, 2012 closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14371)|
| 3:59:34| Are we on a motion or a substitute motion right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14374)|
| 3:59:37| We're on a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14377)|
| 3:59:39| There was no substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14379)|
| 3:59:40| It was we're on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14380)|
| 3:59:43| You know, I think I would like, if I may, I'd like to make a substitute motion rather than us doing a what if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14383)|
| 3:59:50| Let's just wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14390)|
| 3:59:51| And there may be other of these organizations that we may want to give money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14391)|
| 3:59:54| But let's wait until we closeout and see what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14394)|
| 3:59:57| And I'm really not saying before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14397)|
| 3:59:59| We didn't do that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14399)|
| 4:00:01| How come we didn't do that on the last vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14401)|
| 4:00:03| Well, because I think the last thing was important enough we needed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14403)|
| 4:00:06| I mean, I think there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14406)|
| 4:00:07| Well, but if this doesn't exist, where are we going to pay for it is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14407)|
| 4:00:10| If the money doesn't exist for that, where are we going to pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14410)|
| 4:00:13| My motion was to take it out of closeout or the reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14413)|
| 4:00:17| That was my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14417)|
| 4:00:19| On the previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14419)|
| 4:00:20| I know what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14420)|
| 4:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14421)|
| 4:00:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14422)|
| 4:00:23| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14423)|
| 4:00:24| So we have a motion that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14424)|
| 4:00:25| What's your motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14425)|
| 4:00:26| Well, my motion is, is that on any of these things where we want to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14426)|
| 4:00:29| and see how much funds we have after closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14429)|
| 4:00:34| It's just we can have another session on this in July or August whenever this is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14434)|
| 4:00:38| and see what we have, decide if we want to leave that money in the fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14438)|
| 4:00:43| or we want to take it for something like BEC, which it sounds like it got caught on a technicality this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14443)|
| 4:00:50| is just to wait and see what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14450)|
| 4:00:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14453)|
| 4:00:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14455)|
| 4:00:56| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14456)|
| 4:00:57| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14457)|
| 4:01:00| Yes, I'm going to object to this because the way Sam has worded this, if the funds are not available after closeout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14460)|
| 4:01:10| then it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| You know, last year we went through this big rigmarole about BEC and use of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14472)|
| 4:01:18| and called for an audit and said, you know, if the audit comes back clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14478)|
| 4:01:22| we're going to, you know, find you some more money if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14482)|
| 4:01:26| And the audit came back clean and I didn't hear a peep out of anybody about getting them some funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14486)|
| 4:01:33| And Sam has asked for a very, very small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14493)|
| 4:01:37| BEC is not just a historic home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14497)|
| 4:01:40| It's not like James White Fort or Blount Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14500)|
| 4:01:44| It is more of a community center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14504)|
| 4:01:46| And it functions the same way as the East Tennessee Historic Center does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14506)|
| 4:01:52| or the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14512)|
| 4:01:54| It's the same sort of facility with the same sort of programs and the same sort of events taking place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14514)|
| 4:02:01| And, frankly, I think it's just as important to the history of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14521)|
| 4:02:08| So I just very strongly feel like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14528)|
| 4:02:12| and yet they missed their funding on papers in on a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14532)|
| 4:02:19| But, you know, let's step up and give them this very small amount so that they can keep the doors open this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14539)|
| 4:02:27| I think they deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14547)|
| 4:02:29| And, frankly, I think we owe it to them after last year's experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14549)|
| 4:02:34| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14554)|
| 4:02:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14556)|
| 4:02:38| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14558)|
| 4:02:40| I would favor helping back if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14560)|
| 4:02:43| But I do like the approach of the substitute motion because it would also allow us to evaluate other opportunities to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14563)|
| 4:02:53| So that's the reason why I like this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14573)|
| 4:02:56| If we've got a lot of money, we can give them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14576)|
| 4:03:00| The motion on the floor is a substitute motion, which basically defers until, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14580)|
| 4:03:06| close out and then evaluate at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14586)|
| 4:03:08| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14588)|
| 4:03:09| And we'll start in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14589)|
| 4:03:11| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14591)|
| 4:03:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14592)|
| 4:03:13| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14593)|
| 4:03:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14594)|
| 4:03:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14595)|
| 4:03:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14596)|
| 4:03:17| Commissioner Owen Bee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14597)|
| 4:03:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14598)|
| 4:03:19| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14599)|
| 4:03:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14600)|
| 4:03:21| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14601)|
| 4:03:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14602)|
| 4:03:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14603)|
| 4:03:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14604)|
| 4:03:25| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14605)|
| 4:03:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14606)|
| 4:03:27| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14607)|
| 4:03:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14608)|
| 4:03:29| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14609)|
| 4:03:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14610)|
| 4:03:37| Substitute motion is seven yeses, four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14617)|
| 4:03:40| Substitute motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14620)|
| 4:03:43| Anything else with regards to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14623)|
| 4:03:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14625)|
| 4:03:46| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14626)|
| 4:03:47| We're going to ask that we appropriate $300,000 for CAC Transit to restore the funding that they lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14627)|
| 4:04:01| from the Mercy contract that they had so that they can continue providing that transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14641)|
| 4:04:09| and also so that we can get some of those people who are waiting for transportation so that they can go to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14649)|
| 4:04:16| so that we can get some of them off that waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14656)|
| 4:04:19| It's probably not going to be enough to get everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14659)|
| 4:04:22| but we can at least get some of those people back to work, which is where they want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14662)|
| 4:04:27| And it also will prevent CAC from having to turn down, you know, about 50 senior citizens a day who call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14667)|
| 4:04:35| who need transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14675)|
| 4:04:37| And, Brad, what was the amount that you said we normally have at closeout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14677)|
| 4:04:42| Didn't you say it's normally around 600,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14682)|
| 4:04:45| No, it has varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14685)|
| 4:04:47| Some years it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14687)|
| 4:04:50| Chris sent me an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14690)|
| 4:04:51| I think it's been as high or as low as 350 or as high as a little million or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14691)|
| 4:04:57| I can't remember exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14697)|
| 4:04:58| He sent me an e-mail, and it's 1,000 e-mails ago since the day before yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14698)|
| 4:05:04| And keep in mind that what you're going to have this year is going to be smaller because of the three million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14704)|
| 4:05:09| for the reading program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14709)|
| 4:05:11| That's coming right off the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14711)|
| 4:05:13| That's going to make that amount really small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14713)|
| 4:05:15| So the amount that you're used to seeing is not going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14715)|
| 4:05:19| That's just the point that I would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14719)|
| 4:05:21| Well, I'm going to ask that we pay this any way that we can, either at a closeout or fund balance, whatever it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14721)|
| 4:05:29| I think our counties and seniors deserve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14729)|
| 4:05:32| And I want to make sure that you all understand that this isn't just for even though everyone in Knox County is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14732)|
| 4:05:42| county resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14742)|
| 4:05:43| This affects senior citizens outside that donut hole that doesn't seem to exist sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14743)|
| 4:05:51| So this is very, very important to our senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14751)|
| 4:05:55| Right now we have seniors who desperately need transportation for stroke therapy, for wound care, for cardiac rehab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14755)|
| 4:06:03| for pulmonary therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14763)|
| 4:06:05| They need multiple trips a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| And right now they're being told no because there's no funding available for their transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14767)|
| 4:06:13| So we have seniors who are losing their ability to speak, their ability to use their arms and legs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14773)|
| 4:06:20| their ability to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14780)|
| 4:06:22| For a lot of these people, this is a matter of whether or not they can continue to live independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14782)|
| 4:06:28| For a lot of these people who need transportation to work, this is whether or not they're able to support themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14788)|
| 4:06:35| or whether they continue to be supported by taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14795)|
| 4:06:42| So this is one of the most critical things that we can do for our county senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14802)|
| 4:06:47| Yes, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14807)|
| 4:06:48| Just to clarify for all the accounting majors out there who think I lost my mind, no matter if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14808)|
| 4:06:55| what you are saying is savings is still from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14815)|
| 4:06:58| So just know that whether it's savings as we go to close the year or if there's no savings, no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14818)|
| 4:07:06| it's all fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14826)|
| 4:07:07| So it's all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14827)|
| 4:07:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14830)|
| 4:07:11| But now I guess we're talking about on projected, what your projection was, that difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14831)|
| 4:07:16| what your projection was to what actually came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14836)|
| 4:07:18| I know it goes into fund balance, but that money is above and beyond what the projected budget was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14838)|
| 4:07:24| Above and beyond that would still be classified as fund balance, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14844)|
| 4:07:29| Commissioner Burroughs has a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14849)|
| 4:07:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14851)|
| 4:07:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14854)|
| 4:07:35| The motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14855)|
| 4:07:36| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14856)|
| 4:07:37| I'd like to make a substitute motion of the same thing that I did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14857)|
| 4:07:41| And, Amy, it may really surprise you, but I think you make some very good points on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14861)|
| 4:07:45| and I think it's something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14865)|
| 4:07:47| It doesn't surprise me at all, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14867)|
| 4:07:49| And I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14869)|
| 4:07:50| And I tell you, even when we come back to look at the BEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14870)|
| 4:07:53| and we come back to look at this later, you know, we may, even if the funds aren't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14873)|
| 4:07:58| there may be some way we can look at this in another fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14878)|
| 4:08:02| I'm not eliminating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14882)|
| 4:08:03| And I'm happy to do that, but, you know, I'm telling you guys that this is a crucial need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14883)|
| 4:08:09| And some of you are not too far away from being in need of transportation yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14889)|
| 4:08:16| I resemble that remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14896)|
| 4:08:18| I'm pointing right over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14898)|
| 4:08:19| I'm pointing right over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14899)|
| 4:08:22| But, really, for senior citizens, transportation means independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14902)|
| 4:08:28| And this is also a public safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14908)|
| 4:08:30| We have people out there driving because they don't have any other option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14910)|
| 4:08:34| And they're a danger on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14914)|
| 4:08:37| I just want everybody to know that even though I'm older, I do have young ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14917)|
| 4:08:42| Just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14922)|
| 4:08:43| And the number of baby boomers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14923)|
| 4:08:45| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14925)|
| 4:08:46| Dr. Briggs has a full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14926)|
| 4:08:49| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14929)|
| 4:08:52| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14932)|
| 4:08:54| I just had a question in terms of what is the amount of money that it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14934)|
| 4:09:02| to restore the senior ride program, just the senior ride program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14942)|
| 4:09:08| Well, originally I believe it was $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14948)|
| 4:09:14| when the previous administration first began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14954)|
| 4:09:19| And then it was cut to, I believe, 75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14959)|
| 4:09:23| Yeah, 70-something thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14963)|
| 4:09:26| So I think that was the lowest it was ever funded in an amount that was meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14966)|
| 4:09:31| So the last time that it was funded in FY what, 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14971)|
| 4:09:39| It was 75K, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14979)|
| 4:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14981)|
| 4:09:44| Commissioner, did we get a second to your motion, Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14984)|
| 4:09:47| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14987)|
| 4:09:48| Okay, this commissioner wants to be seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14988)|
| 4:09:51| I'd like to ask Amy to have the CAC people because I think it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14991)|
| 4:09:55| I mean, there's ETHRA vans and CAC all over Powell and Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14995)|
| 4:09:59| and I understand what they do and who they do it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=14999)|
| 4:10:02| I would like for them to come and discuss trips and the trips that they're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15002)|
| 4:10:08| And also, you know, I hate that when Mercy left, that programming left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15008)|
| 4:10:14| But I would like for them to come and if the chairman would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15014)|
| 4:10:18| so choose in July or August to have them come and discuss what the program is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15018)|
| 4:10:24| Because I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15024)|
| 4:10:28| And I would have said this same thing with the penny tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15028)|
| 4:10:32| You know, I'd like to know where it's going and how it's being best used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15032)|
| 4:10:35| Well, I would like to suggest that maybe we invite them to the chairman's luncheon next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15035)|
| 4:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15042)|
| 4:10:43| And I know that they would be more than happy to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15043)|
| 4:10:46| But we've had, you know, so many people who have made a tremendous effort to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15046)|
| 4:10:51| And, you know, this is, you know, I've been on this issue from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15051)|
| 4:10:57| and I'm going to continue on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15057)|
| 4:10:59| And every month, you know, I'm going to have people here talking to you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15059)|
| 4:11:04| Because this is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15064)|
| 4:11:07| And it's as the boomers continue to age, the need is going to skyrocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15067)|
| 4:11:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15074)|
| 4:11:15| Go ahead, if you would, ask them to come in June at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15075)|
| 4:11:18| And we'll be happy to hear from them at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15078)|
| 4:11:20| Do we want to wait until June or July or August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15080)|
| 4:11:23| I mean, we can come in June, but just so when we get ready to vote on this, it's like fresh in our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15083)|
| 4:11:28| July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15088)|
| 4:11:29| It's whenever the books are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15089)|
| 4:11:32| When I said next month, I meant July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15092)|
| 4:11:34| So July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15094)|

| 4:11:37| So your motion is to postpone this until July meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15097)|
| 4:11:41| When we know what's going to be how much we're going to have left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15101)|
| 4:11:45| So the substitute motion is to postpone until July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15105)|
| 4:11:48| We'll have the chairman's lunch in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15108)|
| 4:11:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15110)|

| 4:12:57| Did I get it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=15177)|
