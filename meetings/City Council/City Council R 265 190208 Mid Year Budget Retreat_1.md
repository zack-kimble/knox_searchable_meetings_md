| 2:30:47| has brought about a tremendous upsurge of energy and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| And obviously the way these things work, we've all learned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| are through breweries and donuts seem to be core to those, and new restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9055)|
| 2:31:03| And all of that provides a lot of energy, attracts a lot of young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| but also is very attractive to everybody, serves as a connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| and we'll talk a little more about that, to the urban wilderness as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| But that's anybody that if we would have superimposed and had the picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| such as we did with Cumberland, do the same thing with Severe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| a few years later it would be a tremendous, massive improvement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9082)|
| 2:31:27| And that's quality of life, tax base improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| and just critically important to our development as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| Obviously when you look at redevelopment of corridors as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9095)|
| 2:31:39| the services are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9099)|
| 2:31:40| You're actually looking at South Knox Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| so there's a school there, it's a community school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| The utilities are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9105)|
| 2:31:46| Oftentimes we have to either bury or upgrade the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| but utilities are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| Police are already covering that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| Fire station is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| So unlike an annexation growth model that oftentimes you pay for later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9115)|
| 2:32:03| depending on the annexation type, the services are in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| And so investing from the inside out makes a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| because you're not adding necessarily another school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| You may need to upgrade some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| but you're not adding some brand-new school or a brand-new fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| So that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| And when you get into all of the areas we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| in concentric circles around downtown and including downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| and look at all the activity, both in construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| which is very important, but then continuing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| all kinds of jobs are open to people where there were not those opportunities before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9153)|
| 2:32:38| and open to people who inhabit the inner city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| and kids that grow up in some of the areas that are less economically developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| where there are some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| You don't have to worry about, well, I'd like to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| but I have to get out to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| That's the only place I can supplement my income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| and go to school and have a part-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| There are part-time and full-time job opportunities all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9174)|
| 2:32:59| And including the management of restaurants and other facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| as well as those that are entry-level jobs that are really critical to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9183)|
| 2:33:08| So we have Magnolia Streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| Again, you can see that's well underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| And we have that in two phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| and there's a third phase that will be coming before you fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9196)|
| 2:33:20| The phase one from Jessamine to Bertrand is under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| That is going along quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| And then we have phase two that's already designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| construction to begin in spring 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| This project, which involved years of community involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9213)|
| 2:33:41| and discussion and participation that I was fortunate enough to be involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9221)|
| 2:33:45| is really going to be a benefit for the kind of development that serves the area well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9225)|
| 2:33:51| We hope to have investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| We also want the kind of investment that really works for the folks who live in the general area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| and provides the opportunity for businesses and people to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9238)|
| 2:34:03| We had heard a lot about some businesses leaving the area, obviously concerned citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9243)|
| 2:34:08| I think all of that is starting to turn around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9248)|
| 2:34:11| and you can see the attention and the economic investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| and then the social investment as well that will be taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| as economic opportunities come along Magnolia as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| And Blunt Avenue, again, that's very much part of our whole south waterfront plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| and that reflects all, you know, I go back, luckily I haven't heard this too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| but years ago one of the narratives around the city is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| ah, we have all these plans and they go sit on a shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9277)|
| 2:34:40| We don't have too many plans that are just sitting on shelves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| One reason is we're doing these plans with a heavy dose of community involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| which is absolutely essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| You know, the mayor and I were on an advisory committee to the south waterfront plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9289)|
| 2:34:54| when it was developed, and there was a tremendous amount of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| There was some conventional wisdom that, ah, we can never get our act together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| and people were all kind of difficult to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| and we can never get a waterfront plan through and invested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9305)|
| 2:35:09| and that's really working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| Not only the Baptist Hospital site is just starting to open, Regal is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| It was a great economic development win to keep them in Knoxville, or the Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| and they would have definitely not been here at this point had we not worked with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| There's tremendous public spaces that are involved in these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| They're truly public-private, and the secondary benefit from all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9330)|
| 2:35:35| and Chapman Highway businesses are already going to have the ability to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9335)|
| 2:35:44| not only students living in people paying market rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| also folks living in the new affordable housing projects that are right off of Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9347)|
| 2:35:53| So it's a nice economic mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| South Knoxville's folks have been very hospitable and participative in everything that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| so I think that's all just well along the road of just the kind of thing we want to see happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9360)|
| 2:36:05| to make the city the kind of city that Mayor O'Hara outlined right at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9365)|
| 2:36:10| of what makes a great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| Yeah, and I want to reiterate what he just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9371)|
| 2:36:14| Just down the street from the new apartments along the riverfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| are also the apartments behind Shoney's, which will be affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| and just down a little further, the potential Young High apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| How many total units of those do you remember? 172?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| There are 172 at Southside Flats, which is behind Shoney's, and 156 at Young High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9394)|
| 2:36:44| I think it's also important to note that obviously total unit growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| from a supply-demand perspective is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| The housing units that were seen in the pictures here, one was on a vacant parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| The other was an empty hospital facility, the old Baptist facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| Again, you're taking additional units, putting them into the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| and so having that into the supply side of the chart there makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9426)|
| 2:37:12| Right. When there are a lot more people than available units, prices go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9432)|
| 2:37:16| People bid up the prices, and this helps that supply keep that from happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| to the degree that it would otherwise happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| Relative to other cities, many of our housing prices still look pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| I don't know what's going on in Nashville where it's even a more extreme challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| Did we have a TIF or a pilot on that project right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| That whole project is included in the TIF district, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9456)|
| 2:37:40| It doesn't go directly into the project. It is market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| but the money goes in to support the infrastructure around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| to support it as a way that that district works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9468)|
| 2:37:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| North Central, now this is really one that I know a number of us feel really good about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9473)|
| 2:37:58| The entire downtown north concept started with one of those lemons to lemonade deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9478)|
| 2:38:04| where people were very upset, Fourth and Guildhall North and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| about what was happening when the old Fifth Avenue Motel became in Villa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9487)|
| 2:38:13| When people had legitimate concerns about what appeared to be long-term disinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| by the city of Knoxville in that entire area of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9497)|
| 2:38:21| we had a number of folks who met in a long-term series of discussions and task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| and we came up with a proposal to make a redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| and then to work on both Central and Broadway to support those ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| I think some really good things have been happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| Now the streetscape is going to support even further development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| and I think to underscore the kind of things we were talking about on Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| when we talk about redevelopment, it isn't necessarily just large multi-unit apartments or condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9524)|
| 2:38:53| It also is granular and organic to what seems to work in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| and if we've seen the storefronts, Relics Theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| all the things that have happened around Happy Holler and starting up along Central and Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9540)|
| 2:39:05| it really works for the community, and people can walk to these places and enjoy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| Oakmont Exchange over on Broadway is another example of that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9551)|
| 2:39:16| The Press Room, where buildings are now coming to life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| we put in the public infrastructure investment, and again, with a lot of public investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| We're all big believers in public process and public not only input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9565)|
| 2:39:29| but continued public involvement in everything that has to do with these streetscape improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9569)|
| 2:39:35| and this outcome makes a unique area, that Broadway Central area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9575)|
| 2:39:41| downtown north area, that I think is developed in the way that's very much what the task force thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9581)|
| 2:39:46| We thought this ought to be kind of, for lack of a better word, a funky, eclectic area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9586)|
| 2:39:51| that would attract a lot of young people, a lot of creative people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| We used to call it creative class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| I guess we've moved into some other nomenclature from that, makers and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9597)|
| 2:40:01| but it's all of the same part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9601)|
| 2:40:04| Discussing the ability to attract and retain talent is an emerging issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9604)|
| 2:40:10| within economic development, chamber of commerces throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9610)|
| 2:40:14| Millennials, Jim talked about the next generation of folks that will be living and residing in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9614)|
| 2:40:21| We need to attract and keep those folks, and so having –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| and they want to live in an urban space, they want to take the bus, they want to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| and so the ability to attract investment and attract talent, this infrastructure is important about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| I might add a little anecdote to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| We had a group of students from Harvard in their planning school who came through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9638)|
| 2:40:42| I guess it was two years ago when Jesse Mayshark and I and some others showed them around quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9642)|
| 2:40:46| They had been to Louisville and Nashville, and then they came to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9646)|
| 2:40:49| sort of on a look at cities and how they're dealing with things, and we were pleased they chose us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9649)|
| 2:40:55| A couple of them said, we really like Knoxville better than the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| so we were surprised, but we took them all over town and through downtown and through a lot of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9659)|
| 2:41:04| This is the area they most liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| That's what really caught their eye from the old city out, and they saw all the potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| and it was just sort of to make David's point, you realize people look at cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| and the thing is they can look at a building and a street and see different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| and these folks were really impressed with what was happening along the central corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9680)|
| 2:41:27| I know many of you are aware of the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| and this is kind of a big-picture overview of this initiative, and it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9690)|
| 2:41:37| It's economic. It's about economic development, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| about attracting folks and businesses to Knoxville to locate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9700)|
| 2:41:44| It's not just about the spec building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| 20 years ago, it was like, all right, you have 10 acres, you need 100,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| with a 30-foot ceiling height clearance, and we need a certain amount of electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9710)|
| 2:41:55| Well, now it's, yeah, we need that, but we also want to attract great employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9715)|
| 2:42:00| Do you recycle? Do you have trails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| What are the outdoor activities? What do people do at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| And so what are your social obligations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| How are you addressing affordability and affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| So we don't think of that as economic development, but it absolutely is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| To add to that real briefly, when I think when David went through that very much on target series of remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9736)|
| 2:42:24| Green Mountain Coffee, we were involved in their recruitment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9744)|
| 2:42:28| They're employing a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| When they thought about where to come, the factors David discussed were top of mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9750)|
| 2:42:34| and top of all of them was sustainability and our commitment to sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9754)|
| 2:42:39| and how would their employees, what kind of community would they be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| what kinds of recreational opportunities we would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| That was every bit as important as the necessity of finding the place to do the work that they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9765)|
| 2:42:51| but that was sufficient, necessary, but not sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| We had to go beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| And here's something I want to point out about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| When you think about the urban wilderness, it started, in my memory, with mountain bikers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9778)|
| 2:43:08| The Appalachian Mountain Bike Club, AMBC, who started working with the city on some of our land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9788)|
| 2:43:15| and then on private property to start developing these trails for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9795)|
| 2:43:21| At some point in time, Legacy Parks, I can't remember exactly when they started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| but Legacy Parks Foundation became a great partner with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| because they had the capacity as a non-profit to receive land as donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| to raise money and purchase, and to work cooperatively with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9813)|
| 2:43:37| to start building this out and envisioning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| You have IM's Nature Center, who was already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| who also worked in partnership to start developing this idea of the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9823)|
| 2:43:49| Aslan Foundation came in a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| Though they fund a lot of different things in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| they have a special heart for South Knoxville and for the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| and they've purchased property, they have worked with us to make improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9839)|
| 2:44:05| like with the Fort Dickerson entrance there off Chapman Highway, total rebuild there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9845)|
| 2:44:13| Knox County has been a partner, and then the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| So this is really at some point in time, someone will write a story about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9856)|
| 2:44:21| Maybe it's a great dissertation about partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| about how you use the assets that you have, sort of the forgotten South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9865)|
| 2:44:30| how you build it in a very sustainable way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| how you make an attraction that's not only, as has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| it's an economic strategy for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9876)|
| 2:44:42| UT did a study a number of years ago about the returns currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9882)|
| 2:44:47| and the potential return on investment through the tourism and the adventure tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9887)|
| 2:44:54| outdoor recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| It's a recreation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| It's environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| It's saving a lot of the canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| It's building out in a very sustainable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| It provides so many health opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| ways for people to get healthy, to be out and to enjoy nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| And we know it's a tourism strategy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| People are coming through the adventure races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| I'm sure a lot of people have never been to Fort Dickerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9917)|
| 2:45:22| We're going to show a picture of that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| Just the quarry, and we're making that more accessible to people to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| So a number of years ago, we'll make that point when we get to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9928)|
| 2:45:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| Yeah, and just one big takeaway from this part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| So many of these sites, you know, if you look at the industrial history of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9937)|
| 2:45:42| it was the river, it was the creeks, and it was south of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| If you look at where the quarries are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| it was really the foundation for industrial uses in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9947)|
| 2:45:53| And so much of the property in the urban wilderness is sat abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9953)|
| 2:45:57| It can't be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| Your developer can't go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| The topography, the geology, the previous history of those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9960)|
| 2:46:05| make it very difficult, hasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| Mary Myers, Ross Marble, Baker Creek, the Bluffs, Dickerson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9967)|
| 2:46:13| they cannot be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| They're not going to be housings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9975)|
| 2:46:16| Nobody's going to come in unless they really butchered the entire hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| and did some really aggressive like we've seen in other parts of south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9979)|
| 2:46:23| So the idea of taking property that's difficult or near impossible to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9983)|
| 2:46:29| and developing it as an asset for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| it could sit there and just be undeveloped property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| and people could ride mountain bikes on it or maybe dirt bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9995)|
| 2:46:38| That's really what's happened for 30, 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| It was abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10000)|
| 2:46:42| We're taking these undevelopable properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| and turning it into an asset for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| So it's a really smart way to make an investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| and I think it's transformational really for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10008)|
| 2:46:51| So let's look at a few projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| We know that the South Loop is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| We're doing some work over at Dickerson and Battlefield Loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| And the big project, the big idea is this James White Parkway idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| We've got a controlled access interstate that we now own the end of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10022)|
| 2:47:09| and we want to turn that into a gateway park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| That is funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| City Council funded that in this year's current budget, this year's budget, $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10032)|
| 2:47:18| We actually just went out to contract for a bike park at Baker Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10038)|
| 2:47:24| The balance of this, much of this work will be completed over the next 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| The next piece of this, though, is the transformation of James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10049)|
| 2:47:34| as a two-mile linear park from downtown Morningside Park, the Science Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10054)|
| 2:47:40| Continuing to be accessible to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| Yep, it would be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| It would be traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| It would be all traffic, cars, bicyclists, walkers, runners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10066)|
| 2:47:50| and really benefit if you look at the neighborhoods adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| It helps reconnect those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| You know, interstates oftentimes were barriers and cut neighborhoods off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| so the designers had a task of, hey, look, we've got to make it great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10079)|
| 2:48:03| for people that live here first, and if it's great for people that live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| and reconnects folks, then people are going to want to come visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| So great for people here, other people want to come visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| and we've seen other cities be successful at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| And then Dickerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| So right now we're working on the Gateway Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| and we're working on improvements to Dickerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| The current construction projects is utilities, access road, and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10103)|
| 2:48:27| What you're looking at is the next step, which is improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| to actually make the quarry accessible to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| Right now you have to be fairly able-bodied to go down to the quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| and it needs to be safer and fully accessible for all users, all ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| all abilities, and so that is really a future project for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| And a few years ago, Sir Edmund Hillary's grandson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| Peter Hillary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| Peter Hillary was here, saw Legacy Parks, had their lunch in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10132)|
| 2:48:58| Some of you may have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| And he said this is like Central Park to New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| This is a jewel, this is a diamond, this is an unbelievable opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| to have this quarry so close in the heart of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10147)|
| 2:49:11| But as he said, it was not open, and it hasn't been open to most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| Now there are a lot of South Knox civilians I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| who don't really want it opened up to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10157)|
| 2:49:20| because they've had their little private swimming hole for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| But this is going to be a really great opportunity for the rest of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10163)|
| 2:49:30| in South Knoxville and people throughout the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10170)|
| 2:49:34| once we get this opened up and make it accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| Now before we go on, we have a few more slides, but lunch is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| So rather than let that get cold, I would like for us to establish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| bring our lunch back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10186)|
| 2:49:47| We'll give us a few minutes, but then go ahead and plow through the final few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10187)|
| 2:49:52| while we're eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| We'll talk while you're eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| So if everyone would just let council and cabinet go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| and then all the staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| So if you all would go ahead and get your food and then staff can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| I want to acknowledge our office, our department of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| I think it's our office, of special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10214)|
| 2:50:15| Our director, Judith Foltz, and Kendra Brewer, and Elaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10215)|
| 2:50:20| They're all back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| They always do a great job taking care of us at these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10225)|
| 2:50:28| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10228)|
| 2:50:29| Dialed the weather up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10229)|
| 2:50:30| Look how pretty it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10230)|
| 2:50:31| Yeah, and they were responsible for the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10231)|
| 2:50:34| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10234)|
| 2:50:39| Okay, so let's continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10239)|
| 2:50:44| I think very quickly, Becky and I chatted just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| One thing we skipped over was the façade program, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| Do you want to talk just a minute about that and our commercial corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10251)|
| 2:50:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10255)|
| 2:51:02| The program that the city has since 2006 has been really instrumental in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10262)|
| 2:51:10| incentivizing commercial development in those corridors we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10270)|
| 2:51:15| Broadway, Central, Sevier Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| and now we're seeing that city on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10278)|
| 2:51:22| The coolness of Central is, in large part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| due to the commercial façade improvement program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| because we've been able to provide design assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| to property owners, business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| so that the design of those buildings really fits with what was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10296)|
| 2:51:41| So I just want to make sure you all remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10305)|
| 2:51:46| So we'll wrap up the urban wilderness piece here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| So one thing that we will need, I think, from a leadership perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10310)|
| 2:51:55| we've got obviously a new county team down the hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| and we've actually briefed them on the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| But helping educate people of what is the urban wilderness is not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10320)|
| 2:52:04| mountain bikers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10324)|
| 2:52:05| It's so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10325)|
| 2:52:06| It's birding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10326)|
| 2:52:07| It's walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| It's health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10328)|
| 2:52:09| It's tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10329)|
| 2:52:10| It's neighborhood connectivity for all users, all ages, all income levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10330)|
| 2:52:13| It's really an amenity for so many folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10333)|
| 2:52:15| So as leaders, members of city council and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| I think as we have leadership changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| communicating the importance of this will be really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| Just very briefly, I know we had a workshop on the Clayton Science Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| This is an aerial of the potential, well, the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10349)|
| 2:52:33| And, again, Mr. Clayton is interviewing design teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10353)|
| 2:52:38| I've been personally very involved in several tours of not only this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10358)|
| 2:52:43| but the entire community and how it ties into the existing housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| and affordable housing, multifamily housing adjacent to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10367)|
| 2:52:52| the urban wilderness, downtown, and transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10372)|
| 2:52:55| And, again, the development agreement has been approved by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| We're still waiting on Mr. Clayton to sign that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| And Bill and I, Dr. Lyons and I, and the mayor are continuing to work with him on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10381)|
| 2:53:06| He was out of town for a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| He was up in Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10388)|
| 2:53:09| He was in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10389)|
| 2:53:10| And then he brought those teams down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| So it's been methodical, and I know it's taken a little more time than I'd hoped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10392)|
| 2:53:17| but we're continuing to work on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10397)|
| 2:53:22| The next two are important projects for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| So we all know, too, how we park in the Exposition Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| plus the adjoining uses of the zoo and the muses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10408)|
| 2:53:32| Obviously, once a year it becomes the fairgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| And so we've kicked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10417)|
| 2:53:38| I think many of you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10418)|
| 2:53:39| We're at a strategic planning session where we had over 250 stakeholder interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10419)|
| 2:53:44| and we had a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| The property at Chilhowee Park is an incredible asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| And so when you look at what happens there and the impacts for the Magnolia Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10430)|
| 2:53:57| I think this is a very, very important analysis of determining what happens there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10437)|
| 2:54:07| people's desire for that site in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10447)|
| 2:54:10| and then obviously bringing in a group to help us look at what could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| Sometimes when we're here in the community, we think of it in one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10454)|
| 2:54:19| So how can we think about it differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| What may the market also support in and around this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| And so if you look at the infrastructure work from Magnolia closer to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10464)|
| 2:54:31| you look at Burlington and the activity in Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10471)|
| 2:54:35| you look at Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10475)|
| 2:54:38| that really starts to be key investment that could help spur other investment along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10478)|
| 2:54:45| And so that project will move along and continue to peel that onion back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10485)|
| 2:54:53| As you know, the Civic Auditorium and Coliseum is an important facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10493)|
| 2:54:58| that generates activity and brings in any number of venue users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10498)|
| 2:55:05| So in this current budget, there was a $10 million capital appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10505)|
| 2:55:11| That was in many ways to just do the most minimum upgrades that needed to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10511)|
| 2:55:17| air handling, ADA, restrooms, coloring, LED lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10517)|
| 2:55:22| So phase one is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| Phase two has started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| And again, it's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| When you look at that facility, it's really two facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| It's the auditorium and then the Coliseum where the ice bears play and other activities happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10533)|
| 2:55:40| So this is important to maintain this existing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10540)|
| 2:55:44| and to cover the most minimum needs that we have from a user and health and safety perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10544)|
| 2:55:51| I'm going to kick this off the bill and we'll both talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| Sure. I guess all of you have heard that we're discussing with the Tennessee Smokies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10554)|
| 2:56:00| the possibility of them coming back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10560)|
| 2:56:04| And that's something that's in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10564)|
| 2:56:07| In doing so, we're really pleased that where they're looking to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10567)|
| 2:56:12| the location of the ballpark would be in the James White Parkway just east of the Old City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10572)|
| 2:56:19| and very close to just the Stone's Throw, almost literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10579)|
| 2:56:24| from where they used to be in Bill Meyer back in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| And when they left, a lot of the discussion in the community revolved around the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10587)|
| 2:56:33| the team did not want to be in this area and there was a desire for it to be located somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10593)|
| 2:56:41| if it was to stay in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| So we're very excited about those possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10603)|
| 2:56:46| but we're particularly excited, looking at the map over to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10606)|
| 2:56:50| about the fact that we have the real advantage of the Austin home site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10610)|
| 2:56:55| that can ensure that the area around wherever this baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10615)|
| 2:57:00| if it were to come, and we hope that we can get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| will be a mixed income, will contain affordable housing and workforce housing elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10623)|
| 2:57:10| because we have some control over that through KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10630)|
| 2:57:13| We own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10633)|
| 2:57:15| And what obviously comes with the kind of presence that a baseball team brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10635)|
| 2:57:21| and all the things David talked about a little while ago of drawing not only young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10641)|
| 2:57:26| and millennials, and as Jim spoke of them quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| but people of every age love coming to these minor league ballpark urban settings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10650)|
| 2:57:35| walkable from downtown, in this case be a key part connected to the Magnolia area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10655)|
| 2:57:42| and to the area to the east, have a wide variety of housing around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10662)|
| 2:57:46| But we also count on a lot of investment around the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| a market rate that will help, again, invigorate the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| It's done that in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| And doing so while keeping this area a place that all folks can enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10676)|
| 2:58:02| and that will have a nice mixed area of income around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| and include an affordable housing component that right now many of you have participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| in the discussions that the KCDC and the professionals they brought in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10690)|
| 2:58:15| to work on this project have come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| They're at the community input, community involvement stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10697)|
| 2:58:21| What we have over to the right, we have one successful model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10701)|
| 2:58:24| I was fortunate enough to get to observe this myself in Fort Wayne, Indiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10704)|
| 2:58:29| This is the home of the Fort Wayne Tin Caps, if you're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| You could probably buy a T-shirt online somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10713)|
| 2:58:37| This is a very successful, maybe the most successful, minor league team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10717)|
| 2:58:43| They have a community. The community is invested in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| The city, it's open large parts of the year in large areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10727)|
| 2:58:51| They are open to people to come to each day, many events there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| It's much more than just a baseball park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10735)|
| 2:58:58| It has about 6,500 seats, which is about the size that would be recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10738)|
| 2:59:03| that we would want to build if we were to build in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| We would also have envisioned a similar arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10746)|
| 2:59:09| where this would be public space that would allow people to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| When I was up there a few years ago, people could come in during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10753)|
| 2:59:18| walking around. Some people were including it in their runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10758)|
| 2:59:22| There was an area where people were on the tables out toward the outfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| It's a real community space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10766)|
| 2:59:28| It's also brought around about a lot of really high-quality investment around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10768)|
| 2:59:33| and is considered a real asset to Fort Wayne and to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| It's successful by most accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| It's sort of a model that many people in the minor league baseball world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| point to as a good way to take for locating a stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10783)|
| 2:59:49| not right in the heart of downtown but approximate to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| In Fort Wayne, it's not in a dissimilar sort of area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10792)|
| 2:59:56| than we have where we're considering the stadium here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10796)|
| 3:00:00| We're at a preliminary level of discussion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10800)|
| 3:00:04| We don't have anything to report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| We have to get concepts as to how a park might fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| and what it might look like and what it might cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| and all the other things that if the next step would be to come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10812)|
| 3:00:17| we think is workable and present it to you in a workshop setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| to work on it a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| One other component to this, and the reason to have the map there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| where it says future development, that's really baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| plus all of the development that would happen in and around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| I think it's important to note almost all of that is an area of disinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10834)|
| 3:00:38| where there's warehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| There's warehousing facilities, but there is not residential housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10840)|
| 3:00:44| So there's no displacement of housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| There's actually a real opportunity to grow the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10847)|
| 3:00:50| And we have an incredible opportunity to have baseball directly next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10850)|
| 3:00:55| permanently protected affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| That Austin home site, that redevelopment effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| is literally right next to where the proposed baseball stadium would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10862)|
| 3:01:06| The change center is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10866)|
| 3:01:09| The proposed science museum with the housing up on the hill and Green Magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10869)|
| 3:01:14| And then you can see the connectivity to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| It's near our transit center across the water to the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10876)|
| 3:01:20| And then obviously over to Morningside and the Magnolia Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10880)|
| 3:01:24| out to the zoo and to Chihuahua Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10884)|
| 3:01:26| So trying to back away, you know, you can go small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| and look at how great just that impact is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| but back away and look at all the other corridor connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| And so this is, I think, an opportunity that is worth exploring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10895)|
| 3:01:40| It's a job creator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10900)|
| 3:01:41| It's a talent recruiter slash retainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| You know, when we've met with other facility owners, it's not just baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10904)|
| 3:01:50| It's other events, 200, 300 events a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| There's opportunities with the University of Tennessee for college games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10912)|
| 3:01:57| for other college sports to do highlight weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| So I think people think baseball, they think singular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10921)|
| 3:02:04| There's so many things that go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| And what's great about minor league baseball is it does attract tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10927)|
| 3:02:12| but it also is many people that utilize it are locals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10932)|
| 3:02:15| You know, if you look at the Smokies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| a significant amount of users are Knox County folks that love to go to baseball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10937)|
| 3:02:21| And it builds community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10941)|
| 3:02:22| And it builds community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10942)|
| 3:02:23| People, it's walkable from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| Public transportation can get you near and you can walk or even right proximate to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10948)|
| 3:02:33| There will be plenty of public parking nearby under James White Parkway and I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10953)|
| 3:02:38| So in many ways it creates a tremendous opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10958)|
| 3:02:41| but it's really about a place for people to gather to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| people from all walks of life, just as Bill Meyer was back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| Mayor O'Hara used to like to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10970)|
| 3:02:52| I used to like to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10972)|
| 3:02:53| I'm sure David did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10973)|
| 3:02:54| It's just a tremendous amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10974)|
| 3:02:56| I don't remember it, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10976)|
| 3:02:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10977)|
| 3:02:59| I saw you in a stroller over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10979)|
| 3:03:04| I'm just messing with you, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10984)|
| 3:03:05| I remember the mayor, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10985)|
| 3:03:06| I definitely do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| My children and I love going to Bill Meyer's games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10988)|
| 3:03:12| Bill, has the county been at the table in those discussions as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10992)|
| 3:03:18| They haven't been actually with us at the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=10998)|
| 3:03:21| We've kept them generally informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| and the county leadership has expressed an interest once we can get a little more basic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11003)|
| 3:03:27| get the model put together, what it would look like to speak with us about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11007)|
| 3:03:31| and hopefully they would find a way to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| I think there's desire on their end to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| We just don't have any specific commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11015)|
| 3:03:38| We're trying to get this set up and formulated so that people have something to react to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11018)|
| 3:03:46| It seems like we would have a strong interest in their participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11026)|
| 3:03:49| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| We've also had some very preliminary discussions with the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11031)|
| 3:03:54| They obviously have their baseball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11034)|
| 3:03:57| They need their facility, and they're investing in their facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| but the ability to attract athletes and student athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| You may play a weekend tournament where you bring in four or five different schools to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11043)|
| 3:04:09| at a facility like that as a way to attract talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| Again, it's also part of helping attract faculty and professors and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11052)|
| 3:04:16| I think successful minor league teams are very family, community-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11056)|
| 3:04:22| Lots of events, very reasonable ticket prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11062)|
| 3:04:25| Those are the successful models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| It's an intimate experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11067)|
| 3:04:28| It's about being able to really experience baseball and be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11068)|
| 3:04:31| I think you'll be seeing more of this over the next coming months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11071)|
| 3:04:36| and it's an exciting opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| Again, we're blessed to have it directly next to Austin Homes and Affordable Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11078)|
| 3:04:43| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11083)|
| 3:04:47| Sustainability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| Yes, so sustainability, as I think I already mentioned earlier, guides all of our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11090)|
| 3:04:55| This is sort of the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| We have a sustainability office, but Aaron Gill and Brian Blackman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11097)|
| 3:05:03| they work with every department, and they work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11103)|
| 3:05:09| So first we focus on how we can become more resilient, how we become more sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11109)|
| 3:05:16| how we become more energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| In every way, every definition of sustainability, we're focusing on that as a city first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11120)|
| 3:05:26| But we also work with community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| So we have set goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11128)|
| 3:05:29| I think Aaron has met with some of you, is meeting with you all to talk about how we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11129)|
| 3:05:36| once we finish our LED streetlights, we will have met our goal for 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11136)|
| 3:05:41| which was to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| We will have exceeded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| And so we want to start looking at new goals to guide both ourselves as a city and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11147)|
| 3:05:57| Here are just a few examples, and there are many, many, many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11157)|
| 3:06:02| The LED streetlights, the energy efficiency and affordable housing that we've already mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11162)|
| 3:06:07| through the Round It Up program at KUB and the KEEM program and the work that community development does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11167)|
| 3:06:13| our bike share program, you see a picture of the community gardening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11173)|
| 3:06:19| So lots of examples, which we won't go into all of that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11179)|
| 3:06:23| I do want to mention that right outside us, right outside here in the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11183)|
| 3:06:29| are two of our newest fleet cars, Nissan Leafs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11189)|
| 3:06:33| I want to ask Keith to talk about that for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| Keith Gilles, our fleet director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| We have a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11198)|
| 3:06:44| Well, part of our goal in fleet is continuing to look at alternative fuels and where we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11204)|
| 3:06:49| Many of you are familiar with our fused and hybrid vehicles, our propane mower fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| our CNG pickup truck that's a biofuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11214)|
| 3:06:57| This is the next step we're taking to look at the Nissan Leafs with no emission and see how they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11217)|
| 3:07:03| We're going to maintain them in our pool fleet at the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| Jane Burry has been gracious enough to let us have two chargers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11227)|
| 3:07:11| and with the help of Erin and her team, we've got those installed in the basement ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11231)|
| 3:07:17| So we'll be getting them tagged and implemented and getting the ADL systems on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11237)|
| 3:07:22| and using them for our customers to use for city meetings and local events here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11242)|
| 3:07:29| and also if they can plan a trip where there's a Cracker Barrel involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11249)|
| 3:07:33| they can probably eat lunch at the Cracker Barrel, recharge, and keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11253)|
| 3:07:37| So they'll be available very shortly to our customers to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11257)|
| 3:07:42| That's also part of our overall goal, maybe we'll be getting some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11262)|
| 3:07:46| For some of our departments, Parks and Rec has expressed an interest in possibly having a few of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11266)|
| 3:07:52| for their vehicles that they use to sell around town also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11272)|
| 3:07:56| So we'll be doing more of that as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11276)|
| 3:08:00| Thank you, Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11280)|
| 3:08:02| Okay, let's go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11282)|
| 3:08:04| Before you go on, that did spark a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11284)|
| 3:08:07| Relative to our plug-ins in the public garages, do we know the use level of those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11287)|
| 3:08:15| Erin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| Erin Gale, our sustainability plug-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11297)|
| 3:08:21| I will say that, you know, as the market for electric vehicles continues to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11301)|
| 3:08:25| the current usage of electric vehicles is on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| One of the projects that we have budgeted for this fiscal year is actually to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11308)|
| 3:08:32| some of what we call smart chargers that are networked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11312)|
| 3:08:35| the fleet stations that you see in parking garages and throughout parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| and actually just turn them into what we call dump chargers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| so they're a lot more simple to maintain so that we're not incurring those network fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11321)|
| 3:08:46| or worrying that the system is not necessarily being utilized to its maximum potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11326)|
| 3:08:51| I will say market square garage, state street garage, the downtown locations see very regular use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11331)|
| 3:08:57| and actually make money relative to what we're putting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11337)|
| 3:09:01| versus the charges that people are paying to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11341)|
| 3:09:04| So those are in the green, and so we'll be more efficient with those in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11344)|
| 3:09:11| How much do people pay to use them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11351)|
| 3:09:15| I don't know that off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| Any LEAP drivers know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11357)|
| 3:09:19| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11359)|
| 3:09:21| I don't know. It's a price that's set by the LEAP company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| so we don't actually set that price in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| Okay, so we're not collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| We share revenues, so we don't collect it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11370)|
| 3:09:34| But we get paid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11374)|
| 3:09:36| The maintenance providers, and then they kind of give us the credit back based on the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11376)|
| 3:09:43| It's not a numerator, but again, we look at it as we're providing a service to those folks who are choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11383)|
| 3:09:50| I'm assuming if it was, Jim would have mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11390)|
| 3:09:56| Any other questions about that, sustainability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11396)|
| 3:09:59| Okay, that's our last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| I do want to say, and this is some of the discussion we had earlier about how you prepare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11401)|
| 3:10:08| plan for future budgets and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| One of the things we're really focusing on this last year as well is succession planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11410)|
| 3:10:15| I know I'm handing over the reins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| Several people will be retiring, like Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11418)|
| 3:10:23| Part of our succession plan with Jim was to bring in a deputy director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11423)|
| 3:10:28| and Boyce Evans, who's also learning the ropes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11428)|
| 3:10:32| We've got a very talented team as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11432)|
| 3:10:36| And we've got several of our department heads or key people and other members in this room who are retiring at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11436)|
| 3:10:46| A self-inflicted retirement, not being forced out by the new coming administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11446)|
| 3:10:54| Administrations can change people as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| So what we want to have in place is enough information to pass on to be thinking to help that new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11457)|
| 3:11:04| And that new team understand exactly where we are on every project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| What we see as the opportunities, where we are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11469)|
| 3:11:14| And that next mayor, he or she, can accept it and use those plans and those studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11474)|
| 3:11:22| Or they can go in their own direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11482)|
| 3:11:24| That is their right as well as the new council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11484)|
| 3:11:26| But we want to be able to hand things over in a really thoughtful way so that there's a lot of continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11486)|
| 3:11:33| We've benefited, I think, when Bill Haslam came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11493)|
| 3:11:37| When he left, Mayor Brown was there for an interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11497)|
| 3:11:41| All the same staff was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| So there was an easy transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| I worked in the Haslam administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11505)|
| 3:11:47| So when I came in, again, there was a really smooth transition because I knew what had been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11507)|
| 3:11:54| And again, we make our own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=11514)|
