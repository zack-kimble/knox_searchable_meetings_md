| 0:00:29| Welcome to the Board of Education's August 1st, 2022 work session. Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=29)|
| 0:00:59| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=59)|
| 0:01:19| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Superintendent Rice may have some comments during his superintendent's report, but on behalf of the board, I would like to welcome all of our teachers back to the classroom today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=79)|
| 0:01:31| And we're just all, I know, hoping and wishing for an amazing school year for everyone. Are there any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=91)|
| 0:01:45| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| So motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Mr. Watson. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Superintendent Rice, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=108)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board. I have a few brief updates since our last meeting, which I think was just last week, but I have two pages of updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=123)|
| 0:02:13| So a lot must be getting ready to happen or has happened. It's an exciting time of year as we prepare for the start of a new semester on August 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=133)|
| 0:02:21| Today was the first day for our teachers to return to the building, as Ms. Christie said. I know they're working hard along with the other staff to get everything ready for our students for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=141)|
| 0:02:31| It's hard to believe next Monday. I know having a daughter of my own that goes to school, she had a different reaction to school starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| So I'm very, very thankful, as always, to our teachers for their commitment and dedication. I'm very excited to welcome them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| I know tomorrow we have our district learning day trainings, and I'm going to try to stop by a couple of those and excited just for that development they have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=165)|
| 0:02:53| I was pleased today to attend the ribbon cutting for our brand new Lonsdale Elementary. I know lots of you were there as well. It was great to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| Just let me say the new building is impressive. I think the families and students at Lonsdale will be thrilled as they start next week there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| Thank you to Dr. Adams, Mr. Shover, and the facilities team for their hard work on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| I also know that Ms. Parton, the principal there, and her educators will do an amazing thing. It was great to hear her be able to share kind of just some of the journey today when she was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=195)|
| 0:03:25| Tomorrow night, I'll get the privilege of attending a graduation ceremony at one of our schools, Paul Kelly Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| For anyone who's familiar with Kelly Academy, it has a unique mission of helping students who have experienced academic challenges and now are getting back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=211)|
| 0:03:40| One of our priorities as a district is success for every student. I'm looking forward to see that priority in action tomorrow night for the 15 graduates that will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=220)|
| 0:03:49| That will be at Central High School at 6 p.m. tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| I also want to let you know that in Knox County, we're laser focused on keeping students and our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| For that, on Friday, I'll be hosting a news conference with leaders from KCF Security Division, the Knoxville Police Department, and the Knox County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=240)|
| 0:04:09| to talk about actions that we'll be taking in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| I hope that families and employees are encouraged by the steps we're taking, and I'm very grateful for Chief Perriard as we prepare for the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| We're excited about this. I know just, you know, our last day of school was when things happened in Uvalde last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| and so I think it's important for us to address that for families coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| I'm happy that the sheriff and police chief both are going to actually join me in that press conference, so we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| Also on Friday, I'm very excited that the annual School Manny event, hosted by Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| will take place at the Jacobs Building in Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| I was actually invited to go ahead and help a little bit today with preparing 2,500 bags of school supplies for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| I get to go through the line and help do some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| I'll tell you, it's great to see our community come out, and just no matter what people's differences are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| the fact that we can come together over our students is an exciting time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| And something that I noticed in that process was they said they really asked people to donate kind of name-brand stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| just so that kids have some really high-quality things coming in, and what's in those packs is really neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| So again, appreciate that from our community, also from our mayor for taking that lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| This free drive-up event is scheduled for families to pick up school supplies and more information on our website, www.knoxschools.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=321)|
| 0:05:30| and it will be from 3 to 6 on Friday at the Jacobs Building in Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| and it is a first-come, first-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| And then finally, I do want to say this too, Mayor Jacobs has been a great supporter of Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| and I do want to thank him for that. He was at the ribbon-cutting as well as Mayor Kincannon this morning, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| Finally, I do want to remind everyone one more time that school begins on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| It will be a half-day for our students on August the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| I'll be out bright and early at Lonsdale Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| I'll be making additional visits, so if you see me in a line, drop by and say hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| If you see me in a car line, my goal, my schedule is, I think we have 15 schools we're going to visit in the first week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| Try to hit three in each region every day, and so we're looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| And Madam Chair, with that concludes my comments for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| And we have an ESSER report tonight. I believe Ms. Kelly is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=378)|
| 0:06:33| Do you all remember Name That Tune?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| Like, I can name that tune in four notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| All right, I'm going to do an ESSER update in 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| So Board Member Satterfield, if you would help me by being my timekeeper, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| Because I know that's your thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Let's rock and roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| All right, so this will surprise you all now that I am the Senior Advisor of ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| We're going to start the school year by reframing the ESSER conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| So first of all, I want to give Dr. Murphy a shout out, because he created a framework that helped us understand the what, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=432)|
| 0:07:21| And so before we can realign and talk about the how and the why, we had to know the what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| And he did a phenomenal job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| But as part of our reframing the ESSER conversation, we are going to realign our priorities with the state focus areas, academics, educators, student readiness, and foundations, or other considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=449)|
| 0:07:42| And we're also going to realign them to our district priorities, which are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| Part of changing the way we think about ESSER is going to involve changing the way we talk about ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| So instead of it just every time we get up here, it being about ESSER spending, how we're spending the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| it's going to be about how ESSER is working as one funding source to impact successful strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=482)|
| 0:08:13| So here are the primary shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| I thought I would need my glasses, but thanks, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Like, this is really like bold text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| So we're going to shift from, and I alluded to this already, ESSER updates only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| So we're going to talk about progress towards our district priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| We're going to shift from just priorities to focus areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| And the focus areas came from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| They were on the previous slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| And it came from the needs assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| So we're going to realign and make sure the things that we're talking about came out of our first conversations about ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| Dr. Murphy helped us with the what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| We're going to talk about the why and how for students based on ESSER funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| And we're going to shift from just actions completed to actual impact metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| So I'm going to give a shout out to Josh Flory for helping me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| Those of you that know me know I don't have the tech skills to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Thanks, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| So this will be the alignment with our KCS priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| We're going to move from ESSER priority area one that used to be foundational and academic skills to academics because that's how the state tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=552)|
| 0:09:23| And then that's part A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| And then part B would reflect our district priority, excellence and foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| Same thing for what was ESSER priority two, effective educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| It's now going to be educators because that's how the state will track what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| And then as far as our district priority, that aligns with great educators in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| Priority three was post high school readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| Now it's going to be academics for the state and career empowerment and preparation to align with our district priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| And then last but certainly not least was overcoming obstacles to learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| That will now fall under student readiness because that was the state focus area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| And then our district priority is success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| Who will be our new priority owners, our new priority area owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| I didn't put their pics up here for you all because obviously they're in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| But we're going to recycle this and have it be part of our newsletter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| So for our parents and community members that can't put names with faces yet, we'll help them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| So for our academic areas, Dr. Keith Wilson, who is the assistant superintendent of academics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| will take on those priority areas, I can't say that five times fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| which will be excellence and foundational skills and then career empowerment and preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| Jennifer Himmelgarn, who's our assistant superintendent of business and talent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| her team will stay focused on great educators in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| And Jason Myers, assistant superintendent of student success, his team, well, under his leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| will focus on success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| So what exactly is different and what will these priority area and strategy owners do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| They're going to manage and monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| They're going to manage the monitoring and reporting of the process for each of their respective focus areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| They're going to help us identify the right metrics and leading indicators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Because remember I said we're going to talk about the why and the how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| You can't talk about the why and the how if you don't measure the right metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| So they're going to also determine how to measure and track those metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| They're going to decide on the frequency of the data collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| They're going to ensure that the data is collected and organized for reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| And, yes, I know I have a reputation in the district of being a warm demander,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| so I am counting on them to do that without a little nudging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| And then ultimately what we really want to do is share our bright spots and best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| for broader impact across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| All right, Board Member Satterfield, how am I doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| Rocking and rolling, clicking on all cylinders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Okay, so our schedule basically is going to remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| Weekly we'll do strategy calibration as needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| but the priority owners are going to have the autonomy to decide if that needs to happen weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| We don't want to just meet to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| I mean, if we have things to meet about, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| Biweekly there will be priority calibration, and then quarterly we'll do priority stock take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| What will be new is we will have spend down updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| So as a taxpayer, I would like to know, as far as the $114 million, you know, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| So we'll have those quarterly, and then we will do external reporting quarterly in the form of newsletters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| Here are some important dates, because some of these things have already happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| and some of these things will continue to happen throughout the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| So the week of July 11th, I met with Dr. Norton, and we started talking about creating a dashboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| because in a perfect world, that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| We want to have a place where we keep all of this data, so when you have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| you can just click on a dashboard, and it tells you where we are relative to these focus areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| Last week, which seems crazy, it was just a week ago, but we identified our new priority area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| and strategy owners, and then last week we also had our first meeting to prepare for my time with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| In early August, we're going to have an opportunity for community engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| and then on September 15th and February 15th, we are going to submit our addendas to the TDOE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| The addendas just let the state know, okay, what have you changed, what are you still doing, are you on track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| Monthly, I'll be here as well, so priority owners, I'm not just going to bail on you after tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| But monthly, our priority owners will give updates during the workshop, more focused on the how and the why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=842)|
| 0:14:10| and then quarterly, we'll have a spin-down update from the CFO, Ron McPherson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| and from federal programs, that will be Cheryl Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| Ongoing, we're going to continue to have opportunities for updates and feedback during our regional meetings with principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| during our advisory meetings in the regional structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| and we will continue to have opportunities for community members to give us updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| And the whole point of this feedback loop is so we get feedback, we improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| and our stakeholders see how we're using their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| Also, for those of you that know me, I like to have a good party every now and then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| So let's stop and celebrate what's going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| Here's our schedule for the rest of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| We'll resume in September with Jason and his team, followed by Jennifer and her team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| and then Keith and his folks will round out November and December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| Ron and Cheryl will give us a spin-down update, and then the cycle will start over again with Jason, Jennifer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| and then Keith and his folks will round out the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| We'll have our first newsletter with all of this information that I'm sharing tonight included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| and we'll get support from Carly and the public affairs team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| So thank you in advance, Carly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| So those are our newsletter update dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| And, all right, y'all know I'm all about a little football time in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| Well, it is ESSER time in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| And I found this quote from Thomas Edison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| So here's my hope, that we don't fail 10,000 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| But I want to thank you in advance for your grace, because we will have some failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| That's part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| But what we hope to glean are some best practices that will help us move the needle further, faster for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| And because this was informational in nature only, I did not have a Q&A slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=970)|
| 0:16:20| So, Madam Chair, I will turn it over to you to talk about the agenda for your upcoming meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| So, board members, moving into our agenda, starting with the consent agenda, any concerns on 6A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=995)|
| 0:16:47| Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1007)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| Item 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| Item 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| 5 or 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| 7 or 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Item number 7, the Vanderbilt University data sharing agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Can somebody speak to the importance of that research that's being done and what would be shared with the school system as a result of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1067)|
| 0:18:04| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| I'm going to have Dr. Norton speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| So, this is a study that Tara is doing on existing data that they have around principals and principal retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| The questions that they are seeking to answer are what are the characteristics and backgrounds of Knox principals and assistant principals over the last five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1099)|
| 0:18:28| What's the distribution of markers of principal effectiveness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| And what are the patterns in principal placement and turnover in Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| So, the hope is that that data will actually be really helpful as we think about how we plan for principal supports, principal professional development, and sort of what our principals are experiencing here in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1117)|
| 0:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| So, there will be a final report that is delivered to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| It will benefit the University of Vanderbilt for their own research purposes, and then we'll get a report that we can utilize and make shifts off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| So, any more questions or discussions on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| Item 8 or 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| Moving on to board policy, 7A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1158)|
| 0:19:27| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| Item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| Moving on to grants, A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| This question is actually about A, with our voluntary pre-K program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| Can anybody just speak briefly, I don't need exacts, just how the volunteer pre-K has grown or shrunk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| I know there's a lot of, I know we heard from Ellie Kittrell just a few months ago from Bright Start, and kind of the renewed focus on early education for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| And just want to see how that might be trickling down to our voluntary pre-K program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| This may be a tag team question, because our voluntary pre-K kind of goes, this one in particular would be something Mr. Myers could probably speak to, but Dr. Wilson may need to speak to some of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1219)|
| 0:20:31| So I guess we'll start with you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| So thank you, Mr. Watson, Dr. Ryswyk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| So from a pre-K standpoint, just in terms of growth, which I guess goes really beyond this singular agenda item, as we do have our blended pre-K program, which does fall under my purview in special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1239)|
| 0:20:52| This is my fourth budget cycle, and in all but one of those, we have added at least two blended pre-K classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1252)|
| 0:21:01| And in this budget cycle, I believe we added three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| So the short answer to your question about the growth is yes, it is growing, and we're trying to be responsive to the demand in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| Voluntary pre-K, I would defer to Dr. Wilson to discuss more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| But the short answer is yes, it is growing, and we're trying to do everything we can to develop new programs to meet the demands of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1278)|
| 0:21:30| Yeah, and actually I'm going to have Dr. Beth Lackey, who was kind enough to join us tonight to talk about this in case we had any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| So she can tell us definitely more about how that program has grown in Knox County over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| So we have increased our voluntary pre-K classroom allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| We've had 27 classrooms for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| And this year, due to our utilization rate, which meant we were able to serve children who met our income requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1312)|
| 0:22:00| because our grant is funded based on children who fall at federal poverty guidelines for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| So we actually picked up two more classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| So this year we'll have 29 instead of 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| Thank you, Beth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| I really appreciated my time working with you on that committee and value the work that we're doing with early education here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| And I think for the most part, unless you've taken advantage of that program as a parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| most people wouldn't think that Knox County Schools, a K-12 institution, has pre-K programs, blended pre-K programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| So I appreciate the work that we're doing to get started early with our young people and also that it's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| As we're growing, have we seen any issues with facilities to host voluntary pre-K classrooms as they've been expanded or blended pre-K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1359)|
| 0:22:50| So in terms of voluntary pre-K, we are actually going to add a classroom at Bearden because they had some space for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| At Bearden Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| And then there's several empty classrooms at Fairgarden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| We were able to get the second floor of Fairgarden approved for preschool classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| So we're adding one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| And then when our new Adrian Burnett is open, we'll be able to utilize that space because we've already made sure the principal can give us a blended space and a voluntary pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1392)|
| 0:23:23| Awesome. That's good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| You're welcome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| And we appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| I figured I wouldn't make you go sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| This is just my curiosity, just more information about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| So with pre-K, when kids get into it, are they done zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| Are they put in school zoned like they regularly are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| Is it more just about spacing and transportation issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| How does that work with placement of kids in the pre-K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| So we do not require parents to utilize the program that's in their school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| We have a lot of parents who choose a school that's closer to their work or closer to their aftercare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| And we've actually added aftercare in some of our facilities, which is helping parents more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| But it is a completely open zone, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| And are pre-K kids allowed to take advantage of our transportation or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| We do not provide transportation in blended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| We have some students who are provided transportation, but we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| So any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| I just had a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Yes, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| A couple years ago, I served on the committee for pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| And I remember looking through the—I don't remember if it was a survey or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| but the results of the kids that had been through pre-K and how they did into kindergarten and first grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| And it was impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And so I would assume you're still seeing those same kind of results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| We send a survey to the kindergarten teachers that they complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| They complete a survey for every one of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| And I should have brought copies, but I would love to send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| In all of our questions, which we ask about early literacy and foundational math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| and student behavior and student attendance and parent participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| we by far score 90 percent of our students are at or above expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| And what's really wonderful is the parent engagement piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| We do see that our families are more engaged because they have that close contact early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you, Beth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| I just wanted to point that out because not only do we have all these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| but they're very effective in preparing kids, which is the important part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| So thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Between blended and Title I and voluntary pre-K, we serve close to 2,000 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| So that's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| I just don't want you to have to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| I mean, because I have always thought that the pre-K program is such a wonderful idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| and to getting kids prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Are we feeling like there is a huge need and that we are not able to fill the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| that is wanted for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Where do you feel like the balance is on what we're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| and what is wanted as far as the service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| The need is always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Right now, if I can get all of the pieces of the applications in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| I have about 140 children that I could place, which would completely fill my program up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| And Head Start frequently has a waiting list of many, many children that they cannot serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| So I wish we had spaces for every child and spaces in every building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| because I truly believe we could fill them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| Well, that's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| I hate that we can't fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| But I do feel like that is, I just wanted to make sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| because I've always felt like I would really hope that there would be more funding in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| and that they can see the success and that hopefully that that can grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Because I think it benefits all these children as far as getting into K-12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| and their initiatives on literacy and getting up to speed quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| especially if they're not getting that at home and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| So it always has just seemed to me, personally, as a no-brainer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| without having the research behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| So I'm glad to hear we're being so successful with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| And there's great research from ACT about the impact of preschool on later ACT scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| So we want to do everything we can to make sure our children are prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Come visit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| We love volunteer readers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| So come visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| So board members still in grants, any discussion on items B or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1667)|
| 0:27:58| D or E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| F or G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| So moving to contracts, 9A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1689)|
| 0:28:18| B or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| D or E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| It's related to D, the contract with SHI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| So that contract has to do with an RMS system for our security department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| And I've asked Chief Perriard to come out on Wednesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| and just share with us some more context about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| I think it's important, as Chief Perriard is continuing to get underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| with the departmental changes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| and then we also have the new chief of police with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| And I know the announcement of what we're doing on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| and some of the changes we're trying to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| I think it's just important for the board to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| how when we get these proposals in front of us for systems like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| how it kind of fits into the broader vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| and how these things impact one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| So Chief Perriard is going to be with us on Wednesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| to be able to address some of that macro-level vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| and can speak specifically to how this contract would help support that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1754)|
| 0:29:23| Okay, so item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| Moving on to regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| 10A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1783)|
| 0:29:52| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Yeah, I just feel like I need to disclose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| and I talked to Mr. Dupler about this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| I didn't realize it until I started reviewing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| that I do know one of the owners of the property being sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| so I might recuse myself from voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| Like I said, I didn't realize it until I did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| and actually had to call the person to make sure it was the right person that I knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| But anyway, I just felt like I did need to disclose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Dr. Garfield, or Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| Garfield, Adams, all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| I know you weren't here when this was being negotiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| and this is valued at about $100,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Can you speak just vaguely about the value of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Are we getting a good deal on this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| So I can't speak as far as the monetary value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| but what I can say is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| The properties that they looked at prior to signing a contract with this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| the land was not of good use, and there were some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| Doug, I'll call you up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| I know we just recently dug some of this up, and this predates Doug as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| but correct me if I'm coming up to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| But I had him do some digging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| and basically it was the best option out of three options we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| There were a number of pieces that were, and again, this predates my involvement with Knox County as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| but had some follow-up conversation with Mr. Oaks and Mr. Dillingham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| and that there were other pieces of property that they had looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| that either from a topography standpoint weren't good for the development of a school campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| were properties that were already being discussed for residential development in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| or owners who simply had no interest in selling their piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| The reason I'm bringing this point up with this contract isn't about this particular contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| but as we all know, the housing market and the development world is getting pretty crazy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| and costs are going up everywhere for all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| And I just think it's important for the board, for you all to help the board understand over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| how the shifts in the market might be having an impact on us as we look at land acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| I know we've talked a lot about rising construction costs, and we understand the impacts of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| but as we seek out land in the future, it would be good to understand how is the market shifting on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| and how is it impacting Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| So that's why I bring it up. It's not about this particular contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| but I know I'm in conversations all day in other sectors about the trickle-down effects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| and I think it's important for us to understand how it might be impacting us at Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| We've got a copy of an appraisal that KCDC completed for the piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| that we're bringing to you to potentially purchase. I'd be happy to share it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| And Mr. Watson, along those lines, I did get with Mr. McPherson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| and we are looking at doing a quarterly update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| and so basically we can compare what it looked like five years out, five years prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| So that's something that we're really looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| because it will change significantly our budget from year to year as far as operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| I know in the business world and what I do for a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| we built a building that was 9,000 square feet just a few years ago for $1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| and now we're looking at a 6,000-square-foot building for $2 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| So it's impacting everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| To that point, I appreciate you sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| To that point, that's one of the reasons I asked to meet with Mr. McPherson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| and look at a quarterly update so the board understands moving forward the significance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| and difference in cost in land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| It will significantly impact our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| Hopefully we'll see a downward trend, but at least you all will be aware of the trend moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| Ms. Mann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Ms. Shover, this is probably a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I know when we did the Northwest Sector School, there were some issues with just the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| I was actually driving out that road today and how narrow it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| Can you speak to access of this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Are the roads good, accessible roads that we're not going to have to get into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| expansion of roads and that kind of stuff to deal with buses and excess traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| Is that going to be part of the need out where this property is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| We've had some extensive meetings with Town of Farragut as we were talking about this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| The property as it sits, and I think maybe there was a copy of the survey that was part of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| it sits off of McPhee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| We are going to be building a road essentially from McPhee Road to our site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| I think it's about six acres worth of land that we have to buy in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| That road will ultimately become a Town of Farragut city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| They have some very specific regulations as to how that road can or cannot be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| It will extend to the end of our property so that should further development go on to the west of our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| there is access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| We will be doing that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| There was a traffic impact study that Town of Farragut required us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| to where we are going to have to add some traffic signalization in that general vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| in order to try to reduce some of the added traffic from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you. That was very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| Mr. DePore, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| I just wanted to expand a little bit upon what Ms. Babb was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| because she and I did have a conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| Ms. Babb, you haven't been involved whatsoever in this transaction up until this point, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| No, I wasn't even aware that I knew the people that were doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| And your acquaintance with one of the Mr. Scotts is just as a friend only, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| Yes, purely just as a friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| You're not in business together and you don't stand to gain from this transaction, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Not one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Can you keep doing that? Just ask her a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2160)|
| 0:36:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| So before we move on to our next agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| I think we have an introduction that we somehow missed at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Actually, I'll take that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| I didn't tell Ms. Christie in time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| So as we have certain folks who have joined the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| we want to make sure we can introduce them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| We still have a few of those folks that are rolling in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| so I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Wilson to introduce our latest member of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Dr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| We're actually very excited to be able tonight to introduce Dr. Erin Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| who is our day one today, our newly hired Executive Director of Learning and Literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| And so why don't you come up and say hello, introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| Good evening, board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| I'm Dr. Erin Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I'm excited to join the Knox County team as the Executive Director of Learning and Literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| I look forward to partnering with all of our schools and each of you along this journey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| so it's a pleasure to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| So our next agenda item, I believe this is something you added, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Yes, so board members, this is merely a discussion to see what was feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| Not many people reached out to me, but I thought it was worth the question because COVID is still active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| and so I had a couple of teachers reach out to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| I have COVID and school's starting back and I'm having to use my sick days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| And so it was just I had a conversation with Scott to see what could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| is there anything we as a board could put in play to protect teachers if they do end up having to catch COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| and not come to school but don't have to dip into their own sick days for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| And I know that there was, I talked to Superintendent Risely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| I know that there was a tracking in place in the previously regarding having to provide a doctor's note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| and positive results, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| But that's the tracking aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| So I just wanted to bring up a discussion to see if that's something we want to implement again for the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| being that COVID is still out there and I don't I don't think teachers should be punished for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| But I don't know what that looks like from the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| So, yeah, that's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| Yeah, I guess I mean, truly, this is just a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| I don't have any set thoughts about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| But I do look once again of we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| I mean, COVID could be here forever and sick days are for being sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| So sometimes I do wonder if it's like, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| I'm really torn about it because I don't think sick days were meant to be something that you bank and retire two years early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| And I mean, I do think that's what it gets used for a lot of times because nobody ever uses their sick days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| But I do also realize the challenges of COVID, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| So, like I said, I'm not I'm not real strong one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| And I do think it's a good discussion to have, because it what I guess at what point do we just recognize COVID is like because it's like so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2372)|
| 0:39:42| OK, what do we do? People get flu at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| Do we exempt flu from sick days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| You know, and so that's the balance that I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| I don't know where where you start, where the discussion changes and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| But, you know, I think it's a very valid discussion, especially when you've got teachers bringing it up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| But I'm not sure how to handle it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| I appreciate you bringing up the discussion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| I think there's a I think every industry is asking this question, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| Like this is not just a Knox County school system issue, but others are asking what to do that with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| And when does it become normalized and when does it become just another part of your something you're going to take for sick days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| What I'd like to hear from Mr. Bolton is can you remind us exactly what we did last time related to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| And then also, do we know? And I don't know currently what's being recommended in terms of if you do get COVID, what the quarantine time is and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2438)|
| 0:40:47| Because I think that's why the question is being is arising, because I know if you still if you get a cold right now, you could choose to go to work or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| Right. I mean, I know sometimes I get a cold and I go to work and I'm like, you know, no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| But if the if people are still being asked to quarantine and it's having a disparate effect, I think it's important for us to know what that current landscape is, which I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2460)|
| 0:41:11| I think Miss Hummelgarn. So, yeah, Mr. Miss Hummelgarn, if you do, do you have knowledge of what we did in the year past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| Yes. Madam Chair, board member Watson. Last year, it was in September that the board approved up to 10 days of COVID isolation leave to be supported by a doctor's note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2479)|
| 0:41:33| So that naturally shifted to closer to five days once the recommendations changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| The current recommendations, depending on circumstances of the individual, of course, are isolation for five days from symptom onset and then potentially mask wearing for the additional five days, depending on on the advice of the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2499)|
| 0:41:54| So that the the policy did not change. So the leave was for up to 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| But it the usage changed based on doctor recommendations. And that expired on June 30th of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2519)|
| 0:42:10| What specifically expired? The COVID isolation leave of up to 10 days. So the board approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| Right. Our policy. Miss Horn. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2536)|
| 0:42:27| I think I tend to agree with Miss Fab. I think that we do have sick days built in and I don't think this is going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2547)|
| 0:42:35| I think that it's going to be a sickness that is out there just like the flu or the cold or cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| And so I think we could wait and see kind of what trends are and how it's affecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| But, you know, I think it's probably difficult to ascertain how this affected all of the needs that we had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2570)|
| 0:43:02| And I don't know. I think it's I think we just should wait and kind of give it a little bit of time and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| Because we do have folks have sick days and that's what they're there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| So that's that's probably what I would tend to agree with. Miss Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you, Madam Chair. I think the big difference we have here is that with other illnesses, we don't have an isolation period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2602)|
| 0:43:32| And the current recommendation from the CDC, if you're not fully vaccinated and of course, fully vaccinated depends on circumstances, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2612)|
| 0:43:41| But if you've been exposed, the recommendation is five days of quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| And so if a person is not fully vaccinated and they're expected to have a quarantine for five days, that's the difference with COVID, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2627)|
| 0:43:58| And there's if you go to the CDC site, there's a self-check tool that you can use to look at your specific circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2638)|
| 0:44:06| whether you're fully vaccinated or not fully vaccinated, whether you've been exposed, whether you have symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| And as it goes down, it's sort of a branched answer to each question so that your individual circumstances can be considered to determine what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2652)|
| 0:44:24| So I think that's the main difference, is that if someone is exposed, especially if they're exposed at school, then they need that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2664)|
| 0:44:34| The other recommendation that I most recently saw, which was a week ago, was not to test immediately, was to wait several days before testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2674)|
| 0:44:48| So that's also another reason a person might need to quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| So I think that's our big difference with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| We also need to remember that our teachers only have 10 sick days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| So even if they were using additional days, they only have one day a month that they can use for sickness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2699)|
| 0:45:10| And I'm going to say all of us women sitting here know that one day a month might be very significant at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2710)|
| 0:45:27| Currently, nobody is just saving up their sick days to use them for retirement because that program was temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| There was a time when Tennessee teachers had a retirement incentive and they could use their sick days for retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| And that's not currently happening as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| The way sick days are used now, if they have those sick days, they count as experience on that person's record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| They count as experience toward their retirement pay, but they don't count as retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| They don't get to retire early because of those days, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| I know, but do they get those days paid at the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| And this is truly, I don't know, and I might be very mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| I think Mr. Bolton is coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| Let's get Mr. Bolton to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| It depends on whether you retire or whether you just leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| So for example, mine would have not been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Okay, if you can explain the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| And I might have totally misspoken on that, and I apologize if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| No, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| For every 26 days, they count as a month of service towards TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| Now, we do have a retirement incentive in a sense that when you retire, you can also use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| if you give an adequate notice, which is 100 days, you get $100 per day based on that notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| If you provide no notice, you get $60 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| So the TCRS allows for us to do both because we're not paying them out at the daily rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| TCRS would not allow you to count both if we were paying a daily rate out on that retirement incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| So a person can save up their sick days, and if a person has 29 years and 200 days of sick days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| then they can retire full with 30 years because they meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| And then in addition to that, they would also get, if they provide adequate notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| $200 a day times the 200 days that they do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| So there is, I mean, there is some incentives on having your sick days and not using them, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Okay, and I wasn't meaning it ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| I mean, my comments were not meant to be ugly about it or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| I just was meaning sick days really, the whole purpose of sick days is for people to be able to take sick days when they have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2863)|
| 0:47:52| I mean, that was the premise behind ever offering sick days, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| What, if anything, are we communicating, KCS, communicating to employees about expectation for isolation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| Is there anything that we're communicating or is it just whatever your doctor recommends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| And then the second question is, do we have a sense of how much this policy was taken advantage of last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| And I don't mean that in a negative sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| I just mean how much it was used and did we see the trend go downward over the course of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| What was our utilization rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| So I'll answer the first question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| The current advice is yes, follow the advice of your doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| That is what we are asking our employees to do is follow the advice of their doctor on when to return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| As far as utilization last year, we had 1,629 employees use a total of roughly 8,750 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2926)|
| 0:49:01| The utilization did go down the second half of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| Not number of employees, but number of days because each request was required to be supported by a doctor's note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| and those doctor's notes were for less days closer to the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2954)|
| 0:49:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| So my question, I didn't think that last year if you were exposed to COVID that you had to take days off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| So can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Last year the board approved COVID isolation leave only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| So that's only if an employee tested positive for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| So I would assume we're doing the same thing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| So if you were exposed to COVID, you're not taking sick days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| You would only be taking sick days if you have COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| We would ask the employee to follow the advice of their doctor on whether or not to report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| but the COVID isolation leave days were only for employees that tested positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Yeah, a couple of questions, too, and this is more just consideration of how just this disease has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| and how people are testing is with it being with a doctor, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| and I think the health department's even saying numbers we don't even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| because the majority of people are not going to the doctor to get tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| Almost everybody, I mean, the majority of people are doing it at home testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| So that, to me, is something else that would have to be looked at is are you requiring a doctor-confirmed case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3039)|
| 0:50:47| And I don't know what we're doing, what the current policy is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| but if we wanted to reenact everything from last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| I do think that's another thing that we have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| So last year, if there was a home test that was a positive result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| we did require an X, so not just a picture of the home test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| Most of the home tests have a website that the employee could go to and verify their results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| So our department worked with employees through that process to get the results verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| So they did not, the employees weren't required to go to the doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| if they could go that extra step and get the results verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Okay, thanks for letting us know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Has anybody talked to the health department for their recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3090)|
| 0:51:39| Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Ms. Owens, yes, I've been in conversation with Roberta Strum from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| She's the chief epidemiologist there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| So we have touched base with what their recommendations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| and their recommendations are they would recommend that we follow the CDC's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3114)|
| 0:52:04| So I guess I have one question, I guess, for you, Ms. Himmelgarn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| So when we did this last year, just to clarify, so we did 10-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| I guess my question is was there a maximum amount of days an employee could take for COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| Because I think we're now at a point where people have had it or are getting it multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| So I would be curious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| I mean, did we limit it to 10 days last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| We limited it to up to 10 days for one occurrence last year is what the board voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| So the up to 10 days were to be supported by a doctor's note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| so it was what the doctor was putting for the days out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| and sometimes that would depend on when an employee was tested, how far into the symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| For one occurrence only, we did have a few employees who had COVID twice in one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| so it was only approved for one occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| We did let the employee claim the COVID days for the occurrence that benefited them the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| So is there any more discussion or questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3201)|
| 0:53:31| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Are there funds that could be used to cover that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I don't believe so, but we'd have to double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| I think we'd have to check with Ms. Martin on federal programs, but I'm not positive on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| We'd have to double check to make sure, but I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| I need more clarity on that, so we'll make sure we check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Ms. Owen, is the question, can ESSER funds qualify for that, or do we have excess funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3245)|
| 0:54:14| Yes, I think it's really kind of a two-part question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Can ESSER funds be used for that, which I think it can, but then the question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| do we actually, could we, I know we fully budgeted our funds, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| so we would have to repurpose some of them if that's what we chose to do, to use it for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3267)|
| 0:54:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| So no more discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Ms. Satterfield, do you want to do a superintendent evaluation uptake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Okay, next item, discussion of superintendent evaluation timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| We do have a public forum speaker, so if you can come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| If you can come, state your name, county residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Lance, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Is that what you're speaking on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| You want after the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Sorry about that, Lance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3311)|
| 0:55:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3320)|
| 0:55:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| So, updates from the superintendent evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| We did meet today, so great conversation, but I would like to provide what we discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3334)|
| 0:55:43| and if you have any questions, feel free to bring them up during the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| So, in light of new information received from the law department office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| the superintendent search committee recommends the following timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| Use the framework developed over the last two months as a guide for further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| and in collaboration with Superintendent Reiswick at the September annual workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| Present and adopt the final evaluation tool at the October 2022 Board of Education meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3369)|
| 0:56:18| and let the superintendent evaluation to take place January 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| So, to break that down again, we are recommending the timeline that at the September annual workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| the board discuss in collaboration with Superintendent Reiswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| building off the framework that's already provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| present and adopt the final evaluation at the October 2022 Board of Education meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| and facilitate the superintendent evaluation to take place January 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3410)|
| 0:57:00| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Ms. Satterfield, I get the date about January 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| Was there any discussion with the search committee around any kind of interim check-in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| Nothing that's formalized for the purpose of contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| but it's 18 months beyond the time that Dr. Reiswick would have started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| and again, it's not about holding his feet to the fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| but just wanting to know if there was an opportunity discussed to have some kind of interim check-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| Yes, so we did briefly discuss that in the superintendent search committee of different ways that an evaluation could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| We do not recommend creating a tool to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| but open to maybe individual conversations or discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| but the recommendation from the search committee was not to create a tool for that interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| because of the work that we're putting in for the tool for the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| Yeah, I was sort of thinking the same thing, that that's a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| but I think it could be just to definitely like maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| and I think this is a discussion for you all to have in September at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| is to have like a definite set that every board member do have a check-in with Dr. Reiswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| just to have an informal thing because I think it's important for him to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| I mean, I think it's kind of like we talked about this with our lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| I mean, it's like if you wait a year and a half to go, oh, you're not living up to our expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| we don't want to go a year and a half to give that feedback to our superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| So I think it's fair to him for him to hear from us that he is either doing as we expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| or if not, you know, he needs to be hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| And I think, you know, I know Dr. Reiswick is already doing a good job of setting monthly meetings with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| but I think that having the formalized, like this is a check-in to really do a midpoint review would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| Well, that is the timeline I will be presenting in a motion form for Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| So if you have any questions, please ask your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| But yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| All right, so public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Now we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| I apologize about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Please state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| Lance McCold, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| I wanted to bring your attention to this contract with SHI International.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3564)|
| 0:59:32| I had hoped that we would hear from Mr. Perriard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| As Mr. Watson noted, this is a part of a RMS resource management system that Mr. Perriard has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3577)|
| 0:59:50| And there's a lot of, I've talked to him about this a couple times, and it seems like a really neat idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3590)|
| 1:00:01| As he explained it to me, they want to be actively tracking social media and other evidence that a kid may be going in a dark way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3601)|
| 1:00:13| that might lead them to become a school shooter or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| And then intervene to redirect them into a more positive direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| Which sounds like it's a smart thing, both in terms of preventing trouble and also keeping kids out of the legal system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3624)|
| 1:00:34| interdicting them before they really get into trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| The concern I think we all should have about this is that there's going to be a lot of very confidential data that's on this resource management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3639)|
| 1:00:54| And we know from previous reports that there's leakage of information from SSOs to SROs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| And there can be leakage of students' information to other people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| When this system is built out, there's going to be a lot of highly confidential information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| private information that shouldn't be exposed to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Another concern is that while Mr. Perriard's intentions are excellent to provide the support a kid needs who's heading in the wrong direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3678)|
| 1:01:30| I don't believe Knox County Schools has got the capacity to provide that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| And you know it's going to be, if this actually builds out, it's going to be turned over to the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3696)|
| 1:01:45| because we don't have the capacity to provide the introductions, or at least I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| And maybe there is, but we better be sure we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| Another thing we should be thinking about is that there's going to be false reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| Somebody, you know, one of your kids perhaps will be told, will have a report that you have guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| and are planning to do something terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| And do we have the personnel to filter those to tell the truth from the lies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| And lastly, we're going to turn up a lot of kids who are thinking about suicide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| and are we going to be prepared to intervene to prevent the suicide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| Once we've got that information, we've got to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| That concludes public forum, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| Okay, so moving on to board forum, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| I have a couple of things this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| First, the Teacher Supply Depot was able to have a special opening for new teachers this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| It took place last Friday as part of the New Teacher Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| It was the first time we've been able to do that for our new teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| And Carly tells me that around 275 new teachers were able to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| So they were able to go through and have brand new supplies for their classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| fill up a buggy of notebooks, pencils, whatever they needed from the Teacher Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| And just as a little side note, if one of those outgoing cargo vans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| it could replace the van they're using at the Teacher Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| that would be a great thing to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| So, you know, keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| The other thing I'd like to talk about very briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| the TISA rulemaking hearings were last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| And I took the opportunity to go to Nashville and give some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| If someone else would like to give some comments, the last day is tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| So to submit public comment, the Department encourages all Tennesseans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| to provide feedback on the Department's proposed rules for the TISA Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| The deadline is August 2, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| And comments can be sent via email to tisa.rules at tn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3829)|
| 1:04:01| So if you would like to submit comments, you can do it at that email address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| or you can go to the website and submit comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| Basically, most of the people who commented talked about, we all talked about pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| We all talked about that you can't just have a pie and put it somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| and have enough pie suddenly when it's the same pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| So you wouldn't believe how many people commented about pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| We also talked about the measures of how schools are performing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| and how it doesn't really make sense to take students who are not standardized students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| and use standardized testing to say how that school is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| if you don't have some other kind of measures too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| So if that's the only thing you have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| what they're actually rewarding with some of the TISA funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| is they are rewarding the communities that the students are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| They are rewarding students based on where they come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| rather than how well they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| And so lots of people talked about having some other kind of measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| looking at growth measures instead of that just achievement data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| So if you will take a look at those TISA rules before tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| and give them your comments, they would greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Thank you, Ms. Owen. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Ms. Owens, thanks for going to Nashville and advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| and putting your thoughts in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| I just wanted to say that on Tuesday this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| or last week, I got to go to Cedar Bluff Elementary's teacher kickoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| They rented the cove at Concord Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| There was about, they probably had 180 employees there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| between all their janitorial staff and their food kitchen staff and their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| And I will tell you that the energy in that space was palpable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| I mean, they were so excited to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| And I know that our educators have been through a lot in the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| a lot of really tangible things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| We know that some negative things have been said about them recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| but I'm excited for school to get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| I know my kids are somewhat less excited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| but they will be going back nonetheless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| and appreciate all the work that our team has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| Superintendent Reiswick, for you jumping in as quickly as you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| and organizing folks and getting people all moving in the same direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| and look forward to a great school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| Ms. Bam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Yeah, I have a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| First off, I was not here last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| so I did not get to comment and be on public record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| just about the Hillsdale President comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| and just how unfavorable I found them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| and how much I do support the teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| not only in our community, but across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| and the educational institutions that put them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| And especially I think this is important to say on a day like today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| when just, I mean, I'm so indebted to our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| that work so tirelessly for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| And I mean, the ones I know personally, I think so highly of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| and I only know a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| And so I just know we have thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| that are just doing such an amazing job in our school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| and just want to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Secondly, this is my last week on school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| and so I just want to take the opportunity to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| I can't believe it's my last board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| It's been a great four years, an interesting four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| but I have greatly enjoyed the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| that I've gotten to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| not only this current board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| but the people that were on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| when I first got on the first two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| and then just the amazing staff that I get to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| First off, Terry Coatney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| we all could not live our lives without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| but really all the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| And I just want to give my appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| to central office and just all the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| I'm going to greatly miss y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| Yes, I just want to just acknowledge again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Lonsdale's new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| After leaving the ribbon cutting today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| I just sat in a place of gratitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| just knowing just four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| we were letting kids out because of carbon monoxide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| and now they're going in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| in a brand new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| So all of the stress from that year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| didn't even matter when we were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| celebrating the opening of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| So thank you all for doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Thank you to the board for making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| And I'm looking forward to the other schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| that are opening up soon as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| It was definitely a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4123)|

| 1:08:47| It was a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| To be able to see that come full circle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| in your length of time being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| was amazing and awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4134)|

| 1:09:12| and also just getting kids back in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| and hope that everybody has a great year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| And that it's a calmer year for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| I, too, I just want to echo how excited I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| to have our educators back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| I heard from several today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| that were just excited to be back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| and they can't wait to welcome our students back next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| So I'm really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I truly believe it's going to be a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| And I'm excited for you, Dr. Ryswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| Your leadership is just going to be amazing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| And I'm really excited to see that in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| So it's going to be a great year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Yes, I'd love to welcome the teachers back as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| And having been a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| there's nothing more exciting than going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| and decorating that classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| as an elementary ed teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| and new themes and new students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| and all that that brings with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| So we look forward to this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| And this, like Virginia said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| is my next to last meeting on this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| after serving two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| And it will be a sad time to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| but also I look forward to all the great things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| that are going to happen under your tenure, Dr. Ryswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| and the new board that will be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| So great things are ahead for Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| and all of our teachers and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Just one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| I, you know, as well as others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| welcome all the teachers back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| It is, as Ms. Bounds said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| it is a fun time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| It's a fun time for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| They haven't seen some of their friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| and, you know, all summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| particularly the younger kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| And I used to work for a guy that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| you never have any serious behavior problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| the first two or three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| because they're excited to see their friends and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| And there's some truth to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| But anyway, beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| I'm excited about Dr. Ryswick's leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| that he's providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| I think that he will take us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| to places we've not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| I think people will be surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| when they look back, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| in a couple of years and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| I just hope that everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| every student can reach their full potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| whatever they're attempting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| And that goes for athletics, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| And I hope people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| will come out and support their favorite athletic team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| That concludes board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220801?start=4343)|
