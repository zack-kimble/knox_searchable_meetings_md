| 0:02:17| I just want to report that last week the city of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=137)|

| 0:03:18| and with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=198)|

| 0:03:23| and along with Jim Hagerman and Christy Granscom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=203)|

| 0:03:59| and help identify those needs, the needs of people with disabilities and seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=239)|

| 0:04:59| and if there's a need then for a car during the middle of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| you've got to go over to the school to see the teacher or whatever and come back to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| you can use the Zipcar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=307)|

| 0:05:28| and the Project Adam Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=328)|

| 0:05:38| And I'm going to call up Dr. Jeff Jennings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| who is the medical director for Project Adam and Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| Where is Dr. Jennings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Okay, if you want to come up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| And Mary Ann Jennings, the Project Adam Tennessee coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| And Craig Kendall, echo lab coordinator at Children's and Project Adam assistant coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| Those are some long titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| We just made them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Those are good ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| So they are here to announce the donation of 12 automated external defibrillators, AEDs, to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| particularly to our Knoxville Parks and Recreation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| and they're going to give us some more information about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Hi, thank you so much for having us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| We had met a few months ago, and after meeting with Joe Walsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| had determined that all the recreation centers did not have these life-saving devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| After what had happened recently at Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| where a child was saved because there was an AED in the gym,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| we found it really necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| And I can't sleep good at night unless I think all the children in Knoxville are protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| So we went to our CEO, Keith Goodwin, and I asked for two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| and he said, well, why don't we do all 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| And I was extremely excited as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| I hope this really prevents any person from ever passing away at any of our gyms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| that they can be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| So that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| We want to thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| And we appreciate that so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Let's show our appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=424)|
| 0:07:12| We also have a small gift for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| We found out your favorite color was purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| This local artist has given over $4,000 to Project Adam to help place these AEDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| Julie Sturkey, and so we wanted to give you one tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| And I'm going to come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| I think we're going to have a picture taken, but just hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| We want to also recognize, as you alluded to the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| that we recently had somebody who had to use an AED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| and that is Ryan Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| Ryan, stand up and come on up to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| He is a part-time employee with Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| who was a lifeguard at the Ed Cothran Pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| How old are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| I'm 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Eighteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| So what Ryan did was to save a fellow student's life at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| Along with basketball coach John Higgins and two other students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| Ryan was credited with performing CPR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| and using an AED to revive Hunter Helton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| whose heart stopped during basketball practice in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| It gives me the chills just to say that, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Ryan had taken CPR through lifeguard training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| with our Parks and Recreation Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| He says those skills helped him to react when Hunter collapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| Ryan, we are so glad that you were paying attention during your CPR and AED training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| What an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| Now, do you want to talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Do you want to say anything to us right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| I just want to thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| It's an honor to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Well, let's give him a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=523)|
| 0:08:58| What a wonderful example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Now, if you all would just give us a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| I'm going to formally accept the AED over to the side here where we can get a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| Ryan, would you join us as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| If you want to test it on Dwayne Grave, we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=555)|
| 0:09:37| We'll be here about a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=577)|
| 0:09:46| You going to go down there and get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=586)|
| 0:10:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=614)|
| 0:10:29| Again, our thanks to Ryan and to the East Tennessee Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| Okay, that is the end of my report, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| So now council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| I just wanted to briefly talk about South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| And, I mean, there's no news about the bridge being closed for an extended period of time, eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| And, of course, I'm certainly working with the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| trying to find anything in the world that we can do realistically to help the merchants in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| You know, these things just don't happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| I've been in Nashville speaking with our delegation down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| We're going back down there tomorrow to see if there's relief at any level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| So, with that being said, there will be a public meeting March the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| That's the first Monday at 930 at Iams Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| And our delegation that represents South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Representatives Armstrong and Johnson and Senator Massey will be there to speak to the merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| and just hear people and their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| And, hopefully, with their help and the administration and myself, we can find some in the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| Mayor Burchett is also involved and Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| So, you know, there will be more to come on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Remember, South Knoxville is open for business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| and I would appreciate anything that you could do to help the merchants on Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| And, as I said last time, we cross the river back and forth every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| It's very simple to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| We've got two bridges open, very easy to get across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Mayor, there's been several questions, especially in my district, in terms of right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| And I've asked Mr. Swanson if he could address this in terms of the city's position on right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| And I assume you're talking about our position with respect to care and maintenance of the right-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| And I guess to give you a short seminar in how our right-of-ways are created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| there are a couple of ways that roads are created, one of which is, and this doesn't happen very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| but one of which is the city owns property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| There's a need for a road there, and the city creates a road on its own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| And it will own both the underlying fee and it will own the right-of-way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| And if there's ever any reason to close that right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| then that property becomes surplus city property that gets sold, as does other surplus city property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| That's certainly not the usual circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| The usual circumstance is that when roads are created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| and the most typical case is development is occurring and a developer wants to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| And so as a part of that development, they create roads on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| They dedicate a right-of-way to the public, and they turn the right-of-way over to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| And then the public, when that happens, then the road gets built, and the city has the right-of-way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| The city maintains that road if it's built to the appropriate specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| The city does not maintain the right-of-way except as it is needed for the road and for the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| So, for example, the road beside of my house has right-of-way beside the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=837)|
| 0:14:06| My wife built a flower bed in there, and then KUB came in and tore up her flower bed to make some room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| She was mad as she could be about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| But I explained to her about right-of-ways and that we don't really --that's not really our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| It's the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| It is our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| If we close the right-of-way, what's going to happen then is the city is going to convey one-half of the underlying property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=862)|
| 0:14:31| to each of the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| But so all the city owns there is the right-of-way itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| And to say own, we have the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| It's a publicly dedicated right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| So the public has that right-of-way, and it cannot be interfered with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| But, for example, if something happens on that right-of-way but doesn't interfere with the public's right to use that access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=888)|
| 0:14:56| then the city does not assume responsibility for maintenance of the right-of-way beside of the roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| other than the extent to which it's necessary to actually utilize the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| We have hundreds and hundreds of miles of right-of-way that is not actually being used for the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| but is beside of the roadway and is there in case the roadway needs to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| or for whatever reason that public access needs to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| We don't have the money or the facilities or the equipment or the people to maintain all of those right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| And so we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| But we do maintain the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| And we maintain so much of the roadway or beside of the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| as is necessary to make sure that the public's right to use that roadway is not interfered with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| I'm still worried about the flowers, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| I wouldn't have told her that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Okay, any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Councilman Dalvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I was just going to footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| I was just going to footnote what Councilman Pavlis said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| I wonder if we couldn't have a resolution urging the legislature to take appropriate measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| whether it's in support of Mayor Burchett's proposal that they waive some part of the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| or just some relief to those businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| because they're going to be out of business for about two and a half years is the way this thing is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| it looks like, or at least diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| One more year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| The total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| But, I mean, it's a diminished opportunity to trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| and it's got to be very hard on those owners, those families that are trying to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| keep their property, keep their business, and any help would certainly be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| If there's one being drafted, you'll get an opportunity to sign on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| I think that's a good thing that this Council would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Okay, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1012)|

| 0:17:12| Tell George we appreciate him serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| 8B is a resolution appointing Herbert Harrison Slatery IV to the Public Assembly Facilities Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1035)|

| 0:24:59| and whereas Mrs. Compare, by her sweet nature, was able to persuade citizens, businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1499)|

| 0:26:30| This resolution shall take effect from and after its passage, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| Well, I would like to say thank you for that, and I can't tell you how much that would mean to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| For those of you who did not come to her celebration of life, it was terrible weather, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| I told a story that when my mother first started this project, she went to many of the businesses along the Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| hoping that they would participate in this project, and she went with my father to a bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| And the banker listened to her, and he looked at her and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| With all due respect, Mrs. Compare, you do have to understand that you are going to become the laughingstock of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1624)|
| 0:27:12| My mother just hesitated for a moment, and then she looked at him and she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| That's a risk I'm going to have to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| And I think that says it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| That was her favorite project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| It was dearest to her heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| And just so you all know, the last grant of daffodil bulbs that she got before she passed will be sold this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1645)|
| 0:27:35| So I hope you all come and buy bulbs and plant them in her memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1655)|

| 0:30:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| I just had a question that says the money is coming from other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| What were those projects and what was the decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| This is from several projects that had small amounts of funds left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| Sometimes different entities don't spend the entire amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| These are emergency solution grant funds that are very small awards to different homeless providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| $10,000, $8,000, things like that, and sometimes there's $1,000 or $2 left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| We're required to spend those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| So we felt like the best use was to focus it on homeless prevention and rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| This is direct financial assistance to keep somebody in a house or to rehouse them quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| And has this program been one of the most successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1857)|

| 0:32:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1974)|

| 0:33:00| I want to talk about the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the state of Tennessee Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=1988)|

| 0:33:37| After we vote, I'd like for Mr. Burdett to come forward and tell us a little bit about the project and where we are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| Why don't we do that now, yeah, before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| My name is Dan Barnett, address 2035 Lakeside Center Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2033)|
| 0:34:02| I'm the chief manager of Brookview Town Center on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| We have a 193,000-foot office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| It's 89% leased now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| We finished it in the worst of times, but have great partners and great support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| We're 89% leased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Team Health is our main tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| It's their headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| They're doing wonderfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Have some great tenants there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| We also have two retail buildings, have four more planned for a total of 80,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| And then the Marriott Courtyard is under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| It's been topped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| It's a six-story, 124-room hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| We're really excited about the advent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| They are supposed to be complete in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| So we're excited the way the project is shaping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| I'm excited about the Brookview Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| A great concept, great use of land that was not well developed or used for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| However, I also have a concern about this traffic light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| because this will be the third traffic light within a mile, beginning at Paper Mill and I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| and then we come to the Brookview light, and then we come to the Kingston Pike light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| And the parallel roads to North Shore are not managing very well with the volume of traffic that they now have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2130)|
| 0:35:39| I'm not convinced that this traffic light is going to improve things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| I'm not sure it will hurt things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| It's just we really need to have a look at some of the traffic engineering in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| because it is not moving well at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Councilwoman Palmer, this was studied actually five or six years ago and suggested then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| and a traffic study was done that included Kingston Pike North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| I suspect that study has been updated, and I suspect Mr. Hagerman can update us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| But as I understand it, I know the original study suggested it, and I thought TDOT had approved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2173)|
| 0:36:22| and I know the city did approve it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| But here we are five years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Traffic has not gotten any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| But this is not designed to impede traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| This is designed to do exactly the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| So we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| We hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Jim, do you want to say anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Well, it really isn't intended to make traffic move in general better there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| It's basically intended to make it possible to get in and out of the Brookside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| It shouldn't have any problem with southbound traffic on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| There is a little bit of a balancing challenge with the traffic going north on North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2220)|
| 0:37:14| and keeping them from backing up into the Kingston Pike intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| which, by the way, the Kingston Pike-North Shore intersection is probably the most congested in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| So it is a sensitive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| We should be able to communicate between those two stoplights so that it doesn't back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| and contribute to congestion in that intersection, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| So it shouldn't cause any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| And because of the fact that that is such a bottleneck that if you're going south on North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| and you get stopped at the light, you're just going to get stopped at the next light anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| So it shouldn't actually slow you down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Mr. Devin Jay has a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Eight Lane Consultants, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| to provide the services of a track and field and cross-country coordinator for an amount not to exceed $29,818.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2298)|
| 0:38:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| I was just going to ask just a description of the youth athletic track and field and cross-country program just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| Mr. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Just for the council and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Joe Walsh, City of Nassau Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| This is a program that we've been cooperative partnering with Nassau Track Club and Eight Lane Consulting for about 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2328)|
| 0:38:58| Marty Sonnenfeld, who is pretty much Eight Lane Consulting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| has been providing a summer track program throughout the city for a couple of decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| He also coordinates the fall cross-country meets for elementary and middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| and he does an indoor track program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| And can any child sign up for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| And it's very affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| We've been trying to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| It's $25 for most programs, and then we also scholarship children if they can't even afford $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| So that's one great thing about track and field and cross-country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| It's a very inexpensive sport to participate in, so we try to make it available to all the children throughout Nassau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Joe, do we know how many young people participate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I don't have those numbers with me, and Marty was going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| but he had to be at another track meeting in Johnson City today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| But it's thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| I mean, track and field, cross-country, touches thousands of kids throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| So it's really out for $29,000 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| It's great payback for that particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| That's a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| How long to $25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| How many weeks is that program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| It's an eight-week program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| It starts up right after school gets out, and it runs until they have weekly track meets at Tom Black Track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| and they have practices at all the area high schools during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| And then they have track meets for about six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| and then they start having elimination meets where they try to put together like a traveling team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| that then goes representing Knoxville at regional and national track meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| Sounds like a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Joe, is this just for his consulting time, or is this materials and equipment or anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| It's pretty much everything, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| It's primarily salary, but we also help buy some of the expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| some of the equipment that's related to the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| We're really able to take advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| A lot of the high schools have equipment like hurdles and high-jump pits and the like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| but cross-country, for example, it's just you need a pair of shoes and a pair of shorts, and you're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| So it's a very inexpensive sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2477)|

| 0:42:22| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I've often wondered how does the interstate decide what they take care of and what the city takes care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| How is that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| How does the state decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Christie Branscombe, director of public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| TDOT does take care of the intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| They bush hog those intersections five to six times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| but because these are such visible areas in our city, we also fine mow those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| So we just try to enhance whatever TDOT's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| TDOT does the main interstate area, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| Like I said, they do it about five to six times a year, and then we'll go back and fine mow those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Thank you, Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| 11M is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| to apply for and accept an Edward Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Program grant award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| in the amount of $1 million from the U.S. Department of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| for planning and implementation of a neighborhood revitalization plan for the Fort Sanders community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Yes, I wonder if the police department can tell us a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| I noticed that after you get it set up in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| that you'll be turning over some grant funds for that community to administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| So just how does this work if you get the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Well, if we're able to get the grant, it's $4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| and there's about $150,000 that you are allowed to use for preparing a budget, preparing a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| doing research and getting input from all of the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| The design of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| And you can spend up to 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| And the grant will run for a couple of years and up until the time that you need an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| And it's important to note that we applied for this grant last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| and so some of the legwork was done last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| We simply didn't receive the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| And even though the monies will be used in the Fort Sanders area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| the management of that money will rest with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| And when you talk of revitalization, are you talking about blight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| Are you talking about traffic movement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Are you talking about amenities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| What are you looking at primarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Well, the broad way to look at it, of course, is just quality of life issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| Crime will be the centerpiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| And anything that impacts crime, whether it's positive or negative, anything prevention, intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| really any environmental issue, use of the available technologies to impact crime in a positive way will be the focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2690)|
| 0:44:58| And so crime will be the focus, but anything that touches crime will also be a focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| Oh, even street lighting might come into play or something like that that avoids crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| I would imagine lighting would be a key piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| I would like to take that just a bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I believe Ann Wallace was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Oh, there she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Talk a little bit about its effect in the Fort Sanders area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Good evening, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Ann Wallace with the Office of Redevelopment, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| I was pleased to work with the police department on this grant last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| and recognizing that we have a number of community partners that are heavily involved in the Fort Sanders area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| Obviously, we have the University of Tennessee and their police department that often work in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| We also have two regional hospitals as well as a very active neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| And so this grant really takes the opportunity to leverage these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| and really build on key elements of safety within the Fort Sanders neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| recognizing that it is key to some of our sort of short-term residents, our students at the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2758)|
| 0:46:08| And so we really want to take the opportunity to use this grant to look at programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| but also physical improvements to the neighborhood to really see about ways to improve the quality of life in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| and really to make it a safer neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| The other element of this grant is that it's really a sort of test case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| And so the lessons that we learn here will go back out to other areas throughout the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| and really be able to set an example and help them to understand what worked and what didn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| and really look for opportunities to build on this even broader than just the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Ann, I know when we worked on this last year, one of the real pluses was that we were getting ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| we had funded the Cumberland Avenue corridor plan and then postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| So I don't know if you would even know this, remotely know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| but, I mean, do you think that that was part of the reason perhaps we didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| I think basically what I understand from the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| they did get a review back on the grant application, and it was so highly competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| I mean, literally, I believe they had five slots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| and they probably had more than 50 communities applying for those five slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| So it's just a very competitive grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| I think that we are still able to leverage the amount of investment that the city is putting into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| Fort Sanders neighborhood as well as the amount of private investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| and the institutional investment in that area really makes us a strong candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| So we'll rework some of the suggestions that they made to us in the previous grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| but then look forward to build from there with what we've already invested in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| So we can add on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| I mean, would it make a difference, for example, in the University Commons project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| I think that certainly would continue to raise the bar to show that we're reusing a brownfield site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| that has been left underdeveloped and in some cases has been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| a challenging site to maintain and make sure that it's safe because there aren't people and eyes present there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| And so the redevelopment of that site really would be, I think, an asset to the grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| So I guess it would be a no-brainer as well that the Hilton Garden Inn investment would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| The renovation of one of the most blighted structures on the Cumberland Avenue corridor would certainly help that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| I wanted to ask you, you mentioned the neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Do you get any input in the process directly with a lot of students in Fort Sanders, any student groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2920)|
| 0:48:48| Do they give any input on any of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| When we met last year when we originally put the grant application together in the fall of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| I believe representatives from SGA as well as some of the other student organizations on campus were available to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| and they met with us when we were looking to put this information together for the first application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| The Department of Justice just announced, I believe a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| that this grant was coming due again in a very short space of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| So we are working off of that information that we'd already gathered with the student groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| and the other representatives from the university who deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| Maxine Thompson Davis, who's the dean of students in her department, was very actively involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| That's going to be a lot of exciting things happening in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| I know I think last year Councilman Pavlis and I did a walk-through with neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| maybe last year or the year before, but a lot of good things are happening over in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| And when might we know the outcome of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Do you know when they'll make a decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| You know, I have not gotten the timeline of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| That might be something KPD is aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I have not gotten that information yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| The estimated project date is around September, October of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| And it'll run for about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3014)|

| 0:50:29| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3031)|

| 0:50:57| Before we make a motion, Madam Mayor, we've got some people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| I'd like to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| First, I'd like to give Paul, I'm not going to attempt to say your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| He will spell it again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| He's with Kroger and give him a chance to speak and then if there's anyone signed up for opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3076)|
| 0:51:24| they can go next and then at that point hopefully we can have some questions answered from engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| or the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Martin Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| And again, remember the rule is up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| I'll be as quick as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| My name is Paul Jayanka, X-H-A-J-A-N-K-A, 2076 Wyeth Walk, Marietta, Georgia, 30062.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3097)|
| 0:51:49| We're here today for two purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| One, the rezoning of approximately 18.7 acres to PC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| Of this property, there's about six acres already that's got a combination of C3 and PC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| The entire 84-acre track is part of the city's one-year comprehensive plan for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| The second item before you, which is a little confusing and I'll set that straight now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| the second item before you this evening is a request pursuant to our discussions with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| and the NPC is to amend the city's floodway zone, the F1 line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| which is going to be in a drawing that's being passed out to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| Essentially, this line is a city ordinances require that the floodway zone line match FEMA's floodway line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3149)|
| 0:52:40| FEMA's floodway line was moved in 2007 based on a 2005 study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| All we're doing is simply correcting the floodway line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| If I can take you to the photograph that you have in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| it's an aerial depiction of the property as it is today with superimposed the projected project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3173)|
| 0:53:00| If you would look down into where it says the Kroger logo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| if you would follow that down just a little bit where you see the loading dock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| you'll see a purple line that runs right through that loading dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| Follow that east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| That is today the city's floodway line, the F1 line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| which did at one point match FEMA's floodway line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| After the 2005 floodway study, a proposal was given to FEMA and FEMA amended the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| If you look below, there's a solid black line just below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| That is the new FEMA LOMAR line as established in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| This is really a plan correction that we're just matching the line to match FEMA's line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| because that's what's supposed to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| This just wasn't done earlier because this property wasn't in development stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| That's essentially what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Are there any questions regarding that component of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Because I know there was a lot of discussion about that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| I tried to make it extremely simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Did I succeed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Okay, I guess I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| In addition to that, the last meeting there was a lot of residential concern about the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| and the biggest question they had was flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Your direction to us was to meet with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| and we had a meeting yesterday, 55 people attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| and the two items that we heard were traffic and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| To the traffic point, essentially the people that live on and off of Blueberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| would like to see a traffic signal there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| so we're going to go back and look at the traffic analysis and visit with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| and discuss if there's an opportunity to put a traffic signal there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| for the benefit of Blueberry as well as the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| The second item that was raised was flood concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| In order to address the flood concerns, where we are is we have performed a flood study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| We have now been able to provide that to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| and I have to explain, every time we change the plan just a little bit, it changes the flood study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| so some of the comments we've received over the last few weeks have altered that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| but we've now completed that and submitted it to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| but they've not had a chance to review it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| and they will be reviewing that as part of the UOR process and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| The flood study does show that we would not increase the flood elevation by more than 1.2 inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| which is in compliance with Policy 21 of the Land Development Manual for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| and in all these conversations and discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| we thought it prudent to delay the UOR process to March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| so we can address the concerns regarding traffic, flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| as well as we've been asked to see if we can develop solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| to actually have additional stormwater retention over and above what we're supposed to have today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| as well as create some recreational features in support of the city's Parks and Recreation Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| One minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| At this point, I'd like to just let the residents talk, but I've tried to cover all the big items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| and most of this will be worked through during the UOR process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Okay, signed up to speak, we have Mr. Gary Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| Sir, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| and you have up to five minutes according to our Council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Gary Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| I live on 167 Overton Lane in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Good evening, Madam Mayor, Council, Kroger representatives, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| Again, my name is Gary Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| I reside on Overton Lane, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| and I'm the spokesperson for the residents that are affected by the proposed Kroger development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| on what now is known as the Powell Airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| I want to confirm that we respect and are not against this growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| We are merely asking that Krogers respect our request to ensure that modifications made in their planning development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| are not detrimental to our land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| and that Kroger helps maintain the beauty of Beaver Creek that we have enjoyed as homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| At the last meeting, like Paul said, you all challenged the Kroger officials to schedule an informational meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| on how the property was going to be developed, particularly in the flood zone and additional traffic congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| That meeting was held last night, and approximately 60 people, his number is probably better than mine, attended the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3440)|
| 0:57:29| And there was a lot of information exchanged and a lot of questions answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| which, in effect, has made the development more transparent, I think, to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| The input and the presence of Blanchard and Calhoun Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| and along with the Paulson Mitchell Incorporated that are working with Krogers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| gave us a more precise direction on how this property will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| And as we cautiously go forward, we ask that Krogers pursues to obtain the traffic signal for those on Blueberry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3478)|
| 0:58:08| Also, that there is careful consideration on the access road coming off the property onto Central Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3488)|
| 0:58:17| and how that's going to affect our neighbors on Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| That's going to be very congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| It's going to be a bad situation right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| And that we continue to get updated correspondence and plans of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| as changes are continually being made to the property project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| and particularly in the mitigation area, which is a big concern of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| And of most importance, that we can get a conservation easement of 50 feet from the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| that would be installed with vegetation to eliminate future noise and add beauty to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3530)|
| 0:58:58| And lastly, as the development would enter phase two, the remaining approximately 60 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| we would ask that the council hold the development and the developers to the same high standards that Kroger has initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3545)|
| 0:59:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| We now have Debbie Sahls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Ms. Sahls, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| And according to our rules, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Debbie Sahls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| I live at 159 Overton Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| And I'll try not to be redundant, and I promise I won't read this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| A wise person one time told me that you're not doing your job if you don't shake trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| you don't stir those pots and get some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| I think everybody will agree that we've been doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| I appreciate Kroger stepping up to the plate and speaking to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| I was a little concerned in the beginning that we weren't going to get some solutions provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| but at the end of the meeting, Mr. Seen, with the engineers for the architects and what have you for the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3602)|
| 1:00:15| stepped up to the plate and talked to us about some solutions, and we do appreciate that being offered up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| But at the end of the day, all we have really are promises, you know, that this is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3621)|
| 1:00:29| So we've gone through all this process as it is, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| we're not walking away with anything that's tangible, but we're walking away with promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| So all we can offer up as our flagship is that there has to be a trust built there that something will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3642)|
| 1:00:50| So I ask each of you to present forth your efforts to make sure that you earn that trust from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3650)|
| 1:01:00| and we'll provide that trust back to you because I think we've all been respectful of one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| and I don't think what we've been asking for has been too extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| And I just appreciate this time to have been able to speak before you, and it's been an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| So once again, we'll go through this process, and if we need to, we'll shake trees again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| Thank you, Ms. Sauls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| And now we have Renee Oyas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Please state your name and address, and you know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| My name is Renee Oyas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| I'm the executive director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| We're at 625 Market Street, eighth floor, Knoxville 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| At the last city council meeting, I became alarmed at hearing that Kroger would like to rezone the southeast side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| Emory Road southwest of I-75 from general commercial and floodway to general commercial to build a Kroger grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3714)|
| 1:02:02| My alarm was based on the casual manner in which the representative for Kroger dismissed the impacts of flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| through mitigation of the wetland that they plan to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| The Tennessee Clean Water Network is opposed to projects in which wetlands and streams are filled or relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| This is how mitigation works in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| The developer will be required to either pay into a mitigation fund or build a wetland either on the side or somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| to make up for the loss of that wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| The state will determine whether this wetland is high quality and issue a ratio for restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| And very commonly the ratios are for every acre destroyed, it could be two acres created or saved up to five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3757)|
| 1:02:47| So every acre is accounted for because the state's program is no net loss of wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3767)|
| 1:02:55| But that is not what we're seeing in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| The Tennessee Clean Water Network for five years has been looking at mitigation sites all across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| And of the 60 sites that we have investigated, they had a total of 108 acres of wetlands that were to be mitigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| And for all those mitigation projects, 56.5 acres were lost in these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| So mitigation fails at about 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| The simplest way to do mitigation is to pay to this mitigation bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| In creating a new wetland, I have only this to say, often they fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| They fail actually far more than trying to restore a wetland that had already existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| It's very hard to create a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| You have to have a certain soil quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| It's not like you can just bring in that soil and dump it like compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| Kroger has indicated to the community that they are going to build a detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| A detention pond is not necessarily a wetland mitigation project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| They need to get a permit from the state, and that hasn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| So we really don't know what this mitigation is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| They could decide at the last minute to pay into a bank, and then we would lose that wetland out of the watershed forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| So while we are not against having a Kroger at this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| I think it's fair to say that we would like Kroger to find a way to avoid this wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| They've done it at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| They did it to avoid Turkey Creek, so we know that they are able to engineer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| And if you rezone to allow them to build into this wetland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| you just make it harder for additional steps to save this wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| The state will not make a harder decision to save this wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| And so really the responsibility is here at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| So on behalf of the membership of the Tennessee Clean Water Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| I would ask you to deny this zoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| and require that Kroger come back to you with a project that can both protect the wetland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| and give them their grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| I'm convinced that they have the engineering expertise to do such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Thank you, Ms. Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| Well, as I understand it, and maybe Paul can answer the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| and possibly Jim Hagerman, the area that is going to be filled, mitigated-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3907)|
| 1:05:17| my concern is the potential for flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| Paul, will you step up real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| Your all's plan is to, if there's a portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| if you all are bringing infill to the floodplain area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| you're going to, quote-unquote, mitigate that by cutting a part of the soil out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| to basically neutralize the net loss of that volume capacity, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| And per city ordinance or laws, you can only raise the water one-tenth of one foot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| You said 1.2 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Not more than 1.2 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| And that, I mean, as long as, and I would direct a question to Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| I mean, can you all guarantee, or, you know, if this plan is followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| that these residences are not going to be affected as far as the fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| and the capacity mitigation of floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| As well as the science can demonstrate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| they have given us the data for their models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| We are reviewing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| If we are satisfied with that, with the ability to move the water downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| without raising the flood elevation, then that is one step in getting a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=3993)|
| 1:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| Well, I think the, you know, I certainly have full trust in the SEAS engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| This step to rezone the property is just the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| If they're not able to fulfill that or if their site plan, whatever the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| they're going to have to go through the rigorous process of permitting at the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| and state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| So I certainly think the rezoning is not, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| it's the first step to make this development happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| and I'll be making a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Jim Hagerman, I guess I want to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| As I understand it, we talked about two issues tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| One was the idea that if you fill in an area that's floodplain or floodway that you have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| in mitigation, in essence, scoop out earth elsewhere so that the capacity remains about the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| to store water when there is a flood event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| The second piece seemed to be that section to the right of this sketch going towards the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| is a wetland, and I thought I understood Ms. Hoyos to be addressing more the question of affecting wetlands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4071)|
| 1:08:02| or mitigating or providing a substitute to mitigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4082)|
| 1:08:10| Do you treat those the same, or do you have two different review processes that go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| In other words, one is you've got to make sure that flood storage capacity is not diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| The other is there's something to do with either the quality or the survival of whatever that wetland area is to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| or interstate side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| It is to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| The first issue is not so much flood storage as flood transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| Moving water across it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Yeah, moving water through so that it doesn't back up and raise the elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| In this particular case, because you're narrowing it, it probably will move a little faster in order not to rise higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4126)|
| 1:08:54| because a lot of this is very shallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| It moves real slowly, so you fill that and excavate somewhat to allow the water to flow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4137)|
| 1:09:07| It's going to move a little bit faster in a bigger cross-section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| If you compress the hole, you have this Venturi effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| Well, Venturi effect, that's maybe a little exaggeration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| It's moving just very, very slightly faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| It's not moving a whole lot faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| What about the wetland side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| The wetland issue is completely separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| We don't even regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| That's core and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Oh, so that's totally the 404 type core of engineer thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| Right now, we're looking at zoning and one-year plan, which is could this be permissible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| The second step is to submit the detailed plans that you would evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| In other words, you don't get a permit by getting a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| You just get that the activity would be permissible if you cross the finish line with the proper plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| That sounds correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| I certainly appreciate the work that Kroger did with its engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| and meeting with the residents and the residents in sticking together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| and attending the meetings and trying to get informed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| Obviously, there's more work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| I remember from the last time we were talking about an 88-acre track that we were going to develop about 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| Is that correct, Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| The total acreage is 84, and we're developing about 18.75 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| Is the rest of the track going to be developed as a result of this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| In other words, are you going to have spin-off businesses, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| along that upper roadway that looks like there are several parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| And I remember you saying two or three were developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| and others might be developed in the future with other stores or activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| As the property owner receives acceptable offers to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| I think the property owner will come back and request for development rights similar to what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| The property owner is not Kroger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| The rest of the 84 acres, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| You are the 18 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| Eighteen acres less the two out parcels directly in front, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| And you started out by saying that FEMA has moved that flood, is it plain line, down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Floodway line down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| There's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Yes, sir, they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| I'm usually confused by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| And that's why we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| This is where water passes, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| Floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| It's where water passes when it starts to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| If a certain volume comes into it, that's the first area that water would move to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| Can I elaborate on that a little bit, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| Sure, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| The floodway is a creature of FEMA regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| That is the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| If you filled all the way up to the floodway at whatever height you wanted to fill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| the water surface elevation would rise no more than one foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| So in traditional or general flood regulations, you then take that 100-year flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4330)|
| 1:12:20| which goes up a foot, you then regulate in that filled area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| floor elevations are regulated to one foot above 100-year flood elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| So all of that 100-year flood plain that's not in the floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| floor elevations are regulated, but fill is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| In our case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| You're dealing, keeping the height of the floor above where water would normally be in a 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| even if you filled all the way to the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| In our case, both we and the county took it one step more conservative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| used the 500-year flood elevation so that you have to have your floor elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| a foot above the 500-year flood elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| and we also added another no-fill line that's halfway between the 100-year flood boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4388)|
| 1:13:16| and the regulatory floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| The F1 zone really does not come into this very much when it comes down to actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4400)|
| 1:13:28| on-the-ground regulation of what goes on in the floodplain, floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| and what you can build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| If I could go back to the wetland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| how much acreage of wetland is actually being filled or affected as they contour the pad to build this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| Do we know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I mean, it looks like quite a bit of it is left between the building and the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| but you can see a little bit of that dotted, you know, KGIS kind of marking showing marshland or wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4434)|
| 1:14:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Kim Berry from S&ME.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| We're at 1413 Topside Road in Louisville, Tennessee, engineer for Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| The Kroger site will be impacting approximately one acre of wetlands on the site in three areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| three isolated areas under the building pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| Some of that pink dotted stuff near the Kroger logo is also a wetland segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| The little circle there, whatever it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| And how much wetland is there in that general area right between the building and the interstate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| What are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| I don't know that number exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| It's on the order of—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| I think it says four and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Four and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| I couldn't read that on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| And when you do this, there would be precautions to protect the wetland so that you don't dump soil—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| —in the parts you're not going to be in, obviously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Obviously, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Mr. Dellivopi covered most of what I was going to ask, but I do have a question on the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| Jim, did I hear you correctly that the city—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| there's two issues here, the wetlands and the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| And all the city's involved in is flooding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| Well, the city is not involved in wetland regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| We're involved in flooding, and we're involved in a lot of the general standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| engineering standards of the development, but we're not involved in the wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Yes, I wanted to ask the engineer from Kroger's, that was Mr. Berry, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| if I'm understanding the statement that Ms. Hoyers made about what you could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| or not do with the wetlands and what you've done previously in other parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| could you address that, specifically what she stated or asked you to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| You know, the state and the Corps of Engineers, State of Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regulate wetland development in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4569)|
| 1:16:18| And to do that, you have to apply for permits from both those organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| Those permits will require some type of mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| That has varied over the time of my career as to a preference as to whether it's on-site mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4590)|
| 1:16:37| or off-site mitigation or sometimes some combination of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| What we see now is a general preference from the regulators for off-site mitigation with the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| They feel like they have better control over the results with that rather than leaving it with the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| developing the land to do something on the site that they may or may not be suited to do that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4613)|
| 1:17:01| and monitor it over the monitoring period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| So that would take up quite a bit of time to do that. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4625)|
| 1:17:13| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Anywhere from three months to a year to get permits for those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| You don't have those permits yet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| You haven't filed your plan or have you filed a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| No, those permits have not been filed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| What we're asking for is just to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| The harsh part of it is the wetlands, and that goes back to the Corps and to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| So you're asking us to allow this to flow through and trust engineering and trust the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| They're going to protect the floodway, and so I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| So just for clarification to the Kroger representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| at this point there is not a wetland mitigation plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4677)|
| 1:18:05| Actually, we're filing one now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| We've put a plan together, and we're going to submit it to the Corps of Engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| and that review process can take anywhere from three months, six months, even to a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| to get the Corps of Engineers to say, yes, we agree with your plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| and we agree with the solution or mitigation to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| Could you describe the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Well, the plan that right now is being discussed is buying into a mitigation bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| which is essentially do I need to explain a mitigation bank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| In a nutshell, somebody purchases property in typically the flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| where the water is released at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| and they take this land and basically create a preservation area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| and restricting any type of development on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| and allowing it to become a wetland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| And I think what she was referring to was apparently that some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| were creating these wetlands mitigation banks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| but yet they're not maybe creating it to the standard they're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| or they're not doing it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| I think that's something that would be regulated by the Corps of Engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| on a national level, but I think that's what she was referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| that those banks aren't doing the right job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| I mean, we will have to go back and make sure that the bank we're looking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| is accredited and has all its checks and balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| to make sure they are a good bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| I never thought of that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Who owns the property to the east of your project where the wetland is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| That would be the person that's selling us our track, Mrs. Hinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| And east of the track is going to stay wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| That's a larger wetland area that we're not going to disturb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Can you add on to that wetland area at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| Can you make that larger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| I mean, you know, it could be possible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| We have done that in certain cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| You know, it may not be preferred by the regulators at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| as a mitigation approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| I was just going to add one more thing for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| Part of the attraction of the proposed riparian buffer is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4823)|
| 1:20:30| I think the neighborhood, the people in the area would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| there is discussion of this easement that is potential in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| because I know the wetlands have talked with some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| And if there were a walking trail, Paul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| did you all say that as part of your site plan is to have a walking trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| near the riparian buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| We're going to be working through that through the URL processes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| create or facilitate the ability to have a park or a walkway because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| that was something that the MPC and the city spoke to us about at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| very first meeting that I know your comprehensive parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| and recreation plan requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| or has designated this area to have some type of park feature to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| So that will be incorporated into our plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| and it will be part of our URL process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Briefly, I was going to address this to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| I heard a statement or two made about discussion and trust by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| neighborhood folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| and I'm assuming that your engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| when you're looking at plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| can impose certain requirements that address the traffic congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| whether it's on that access road on Central Avenue or whether it's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| of the other aspects they were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| maybe looking at the light at Blueberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| I mean, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| you have some ability in reviewing plans to require certain activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| We can't do that during the zoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| but you do have that during the site review process, do you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| It does have to meet certain requirements in terms of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| The other interesting, challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| complicating part is that the city does not own these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| These are county roads, and so we're working with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| And Emery Road is also a state road, so they have to sign off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| Lots of hands get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| TDOT has to sign off on anything that goes in on Emery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| but the county is also very involved in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| But the general thrust is correct, that during the plan review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| that's where you actually tack down some of these requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Is that the end of discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| It's been pretty thorough, I'd say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| 12B is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Emery Road, southwest of I-75, from PC1, C3, A1, and F1 to PC1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4986)|

| 1:23:17| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| Okay, we are down to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Nobody has signed up for that, so there being no further business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130219?start=5010)|
