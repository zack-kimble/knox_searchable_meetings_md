| 0:09:03| I believe that's the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| I just didn't know if it was appropriate to bring that up at this moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| or wait until it comes up in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=547)|

| 0:13:08| Next on the agenda is an alley closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| This is agenda item number five, file 9A20AC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| The applicant is Mike Seward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| The right-of-way to be closed is an unnamed alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| between Knott Avenue and Cate Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| location between Pilcay Road and Third Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| Applicants reason for closure, consolidating lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| on both sides of the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Its current layout is not conducive to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Staff recommendation, deny closure of the unnamed alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| that runs from Pilcay Road to Turkey Creek, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| Third Creek between the undeveloped right-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| of Knott and Cate Avenues, since it could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| serve surrounding properties upon their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| Is Mr. Howe present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| Or Mr. Seward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| Are there any individuals who would like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| on behalf of this item or opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=847)|
| 0:14:15| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| When I looked at this property, I couldn't really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| I don't agree with staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| I think it should be looked at as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| as a developer wants to go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| if a developer wants to go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| I think he should have the freedom to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| this is a vacant piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| to develop as he sees fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| like we give all the other developers their right to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| turn it over to their engineers and design a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| To me, this one and the next one that has a street in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| that's not there, they just get in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| They make it harder for someone to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| and this would be a very nice piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| in a place that needs development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| So I would like to see us grant the removal of the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=927)|
| 0:15:35| and then the next one, the street closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| Commissioner Eddie Smith, did you have a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Mine was going to be opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| I was going to approve staff just because as you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| with the city engineering department and NKUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| both having requested to retain all of their easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| I think we've got to go with staff on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Otherwise, we're starting to get in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| and try and decide what staff's already looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| without having their input in city engineering and KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| on what easements they need in that property and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| So I think Commissioner Graf's already made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| No, I didn't make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Okay, but to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| an awful lot of the property that is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| has problems or issues with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| that the engineers need to work around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| If they can't do anything with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| then apparently they have looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| and think that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| and would like more freedom to do their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| rather than be hindered by the alley and the street right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| So on that, since the applicant isn't here to argue that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| I'm going to stick with staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| and make the motion that we deny her staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| I'll recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Does this right-of-way serve any other property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| besides the applicants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| And I also just want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| that these two right-of-way closure requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| were tied to rezoning cases that were heard last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| For the RN6 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| their intent was to put an apartment complex here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| So we're recommending denial just to keep the option open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| pending whatever development plans might come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| So this doesn't stop anyone from requesting closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| at a time when someone does have plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| It just leaves the option open for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| just kind of leaves it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| I did communicate to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| that we were recommending denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| and did not hear anything from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| and he's not present at the meeting to argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| So I think at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| he's not planning on doing the apartment complex anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| due to the denial of the rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Yeah, I think also, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| when you look at the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| or the adjacent development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| the alley helps protect the general character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| and encourages development similarly to what's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| I think that would be a positive toward the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| to deny the request per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| We have a second by Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Graf, opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1124)|
| 0:18:54| All right, item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| This is a closure of right-of-way, public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| Staff is recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Agenda number six, file 9820SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| Applicant is Mike Seward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Right-of-way to be closed, Kate Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| location between Pilcay Road and Third Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| Applicant's reason for closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| consolidating tiny lots on both sides of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Its current layout is not conducive to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| deny closure of the portion of Kate Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| that runs from Pilcay Road to Third Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| since it could potentially serve surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| on their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Similar to the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Chair will recognize Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| Just a question of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Michelle mentioned that someone got denied on their zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| and when somebody figured out what they wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| from a development plan standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| they could come back and apply for the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Is this a case where if we deny this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| does somebody have to wait a year before they can reapply for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| My understanding is that they have to wait a year to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| They will have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| They will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1208)|
| 0:20:17| I mean, we've had this item on the agenda for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| How many months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| For a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| A year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| And the applicant is not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| His desire apparently is not as strong as what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Can I speak for just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| I just looked at our bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| So, just to double check, Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| So, the commission votes to deny any application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| for rezoning, use-on-review, special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| or one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| A new application for the same proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| shall not be accepted by staff for a period of one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| So, I think that that leaves it open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| for someone to come back and request a street closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| or right-of-way closure in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Stan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| With that motion to deny per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Chair will entertain a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1266)|

| 0:23:34| he owns a combination of pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| that are kind of jigsaw in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| and he is interested in marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| and selling that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| And so we have combined these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| into a single application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| for a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| We had initially asked for CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| since there is CA zoning across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| at the European Auto Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| However, after working with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| and speaking with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| we decided that it would be in our best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| to amend our application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| for the mixed-use SD NWCO4 sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| with the planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| The reason for that is it would still give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| the flexibility for any type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| that we may want to put on that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| but it also would come back before the TTCDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| and this board for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| And that's, I think, important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| for a piece of property like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| since it does about residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| I have been in contact with some of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| who had some questions about the intent for this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| and what we're wanting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| and they don't have any objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| to the planned commercial rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| They will have a chance to provide input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| to address any of the concerns they may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| with the actual development once that comes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| So with that, we appreciate staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| and ask that you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1496)|

| 0:27:01| Would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| I'll defer to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1624)|

| 0:27:22| My name is Carolyn Acuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| I live at 4304 Hack Road in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| I have lived there 45 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| so I have driven by this piece of property owned by Mr. Nelson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| for all those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| I also own property on Meredith Road where he resides now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| I do not know him personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| I am not against planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| My two concerns, my primary concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| is the traffic pattern on West Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| It is a thoroughfare, particularly in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| and the afternoon, and when Levi Field Sports Area Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| when they're bringing kids and taking them home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| and they're in a hurry to go home and sleep and get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| and do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Been there, done that with my son and my grandson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| I didn't know about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| I've seen the sign briefly, but I'm going to have an aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| a personal aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| One month ago today, my son, who rented our house on Meredith Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| was found dead in his room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| He did have a COVID diagnosis, positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| but it's been a difficult time for the funeral and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| and I talked to Liz last minute, just found out about this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| so bear with me, please, and I'll not run over my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Mr. Welch, Mr. Noah Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| is the one that has the appliance repair sideline there at his house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| and his property is adjacent to this tract of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| For years I saw the big rig truck there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| The traffic comes, if you're coming from West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| east toward Clinton Highway, there's a dip where Mr. Welch lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| and has the little appliances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Then you come right to the driveway of Mr. Nelson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| and I thought maybe somebody had died because they just let it grow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| and didn't mow it and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| I understand now that he's moved over to Meredith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| so he has a love for the area like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| But I will tell you that the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| I don't know when the planners went out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| and how much traffic there was at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| but I ask you to reconsider what is happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| on West Beaver Creek Drive with no shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| If you look at the accidents that have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| right in front at that dip there's the flowers on the pole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| pickup truck split in two, the man died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| A little boy had been hit and died, I understand, right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| kind of near this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| All I'm saying is we need new homes out in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| My husband and I remodeled ours and decided to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| We love the area, as I'm sure Mr. Nelson does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Mr. John King represents some neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| I don't know him personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| and I haven't talked to but one neighbor out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| but I understand that other people are real concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| about when I mentioned it, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| well, surely they wouldn't come out on West Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Of course they would come out on West Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| All I'm saying is the line of sight is terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| The speed limit is not enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I am told this is hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| The county does not stop the speeders and give the tickets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| because the money goes to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| I cannot corroborate that, but I know that the speeding never stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| I turn in at Della Drive, and then I live on Hack Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| and it's a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| It's the old lazy acres, they call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| I think planning and development is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| I'm seeing it everywhere in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| But I'm asking you to help everybody who lives out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| and the people who come who live over near the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| and work west who use Powell Drive to cut through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| then Beaver Creek, and head on over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| I'm just asking you to really look at the traffic pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| Be out there in the morning when they're taking them to Grace Baptist Private School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| Be out there in the afternoon when they're going to Levi Field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| and they're cutting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| Honestly, you'll be coming down Beaver Creek, and they see you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| and they pull out anyway because they've got to get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| They're worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| Meredith Road, that's not under consideration, but it has straightaways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| and I'm telling you, they really speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| After they go by Mr. Nelson's house, there are some dips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| and they fly, and nobody's stopping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| So anyway, all I'm saying is I don't really know the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| I don't know if it's going to be rubber stamped today and then go to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| but I'm asking you to take a real good look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| That's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Time of day and traffic pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| If I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| I apologize, but you need to conclude your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| Do I understand correctly that over 400 additional going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| and out will happen if you build 25 houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| Do I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| Liz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| That is an estimate based on the number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| and the traffic standards from AASHTO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| the American Association of Highway Transportation Professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| We run that for every case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Every day will be different, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| All I'm saying is when they pull out, they're not going to have a good line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| I'm asking for them to have a good line of sight and us to be able to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| When I come down a hill in a dip and then I come to the new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| that's all I'm saying is be considerate of safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| and also the drainage that may be coming into Lazy Acres from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| I thank you very much for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Ms. Acoff, please accept our condolences and sorry for your loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Well, I just share that because I'm late on learning about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| I saw it there. I knew it meant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I just didn't know what change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| So I'm not against Mr. Nelson at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Just do your homework. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Let me just bring up the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Some of your comments will be addressed in the actual design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| and approval of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Thank you for your comments and thank you for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Well, we had one other person in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| so I was just going to see if two minutes would be adequate for his comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| that we add the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| I know that would give Mr. Mullins up to seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| If Mr. Conroy is present, you want to give an extra two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| That's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| I'd actually like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| First of all, I'd just like to thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Can you come up to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| If you could give me one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| I'm actually going to have to cede my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| We have some representation here who wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| My name, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Yes, your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| My name is Ian Conroy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| I live at 7236 Avenue Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| I'm actually in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| As I've just said, I'm ceding my time to this gentleman here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| My name is Hayden Short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| I'm here filling in for Mr. John King that Ms. Acuff just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| representing Mr. Tyler Smith at 7305 Avenue Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| We are asking that this hearing and decision be postponed at least a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| Mr. King had a prior engagement that took him out of the state for this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| and he's unable to be here and represent them and make the argument here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| So we're asking that this be postponed until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| I've also got some photos, if the commission decides not to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| that I'd like to just hand over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Just hand those at the end of the table for Gene or Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2167)|
| 0:36:16| Those are just photos illustrating the water problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| and the line-of-sight problems that were just mentioned by Ms. Acuff with an index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| indicating what each photo is that Mr. King wanted into the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| in the event that the commission does not postpone this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| I'm here on behalf of the applicant Nelson Farm Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| Mr. Nelson intended to be here himself to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| However, he has come down with COVID himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| and I was not retained until late Tuesday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| So I do apologize for actually handing out some things I may refer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| instead of sending you a letter like I normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| This is 8.1 acres on West Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| It's an oddly shaped lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| It's about 220 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| It's kind of shaped like an obtuse boomerang, long and narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| It does share a substantial contiguous property line with the Powell Levi Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| which is an opportunity to improve access to that park, both pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| and certainly pedestrian access there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| The staff has recommended 3.5 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| which certainly is consistent with the LDR sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| and the growth policy plan in this area, which is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| The applicant has asked for five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| which is also consistent with the LDR sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| and the growth policy plan here in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| And I want to just address the neighborhood concerns first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| I know there's been some concerns about the traffic and the stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| and I know Engineering and Public Works, they've met with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| The applicants met with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| They met out there with the neighbor's representation, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| and with the commissioner of the 6th District of the county, Terry Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| to talk about some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And as a result of that, Mr. Snowden did some investigation in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| and found that a lot of the water problems were due to a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| and this is in the comments that are before you, an email he sent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| Commissioner Hill, on July 30th of this year, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| there was an impounded spillway, which was allowing standing water to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| And he also determined that a lot of the concerns of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| that showed these pictures that were passed around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| that was because the grades on their property were less than 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| and he pointed out that, you know, for a flat road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| you want to at least have 2% grade to clear the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| So there's undoubtedly – the pictures show there's some water conditions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| However, they will not be made worse by this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| no matter what density it's developed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| They will have to work with Engineering Public Works and Stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| to design it in a way where the post-development flows are equal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| or less than the current flows right now from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| So, like you said, Chair Phillips, those things will be addressed at the design phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2361)|
| 0:39:30| I wanted to – the biggest issue here for the applicant, touch on traffic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| I mean, we don't even know where we're going to have an entrance to the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| We do believe that there's sight lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| There's been some that are adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| We've discussed potentially a deceleration lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| We don't know if that's going to be required or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Again, that will get worked out during the design phase of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| Regarding density, the applicant initially reached out to Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| and was looking for some medium-density residential on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| and Planning said that they didn't think they could support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| and this is in one of the e-mails I pointed out, but I handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| There's an e-mail from, I think, from Michelle Portier to Kim Nelson on June 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| But they did say, well, you could look at the low-density residential, the RA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| and then they gave them a link, which was to a similar piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| a similar development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| That was the Highborough Farms, I think, development off of Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| which is a similar piece of property in that it's very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| And that link, when you look at the zoning that was approved for that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| was at 5 dwelling units an acre for PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| It's also surrounded by RA, agricultural, and other PR densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| that are less than 5 dwelling units an acre, some at 3 and some at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| And if you look further, the staff pointed out two different properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2452)|
| 0:40:59| that they thought were similar to this, the Lazy Acres, which is at 2.8, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| and Beachwood Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Beachwood Estates is about 4,000 feet west of this development as the crow flies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| And when you look at, and I have a map here of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| You have it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| If you were to look at a 4,000-foot radius of development in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| you will see a lot of RA to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| You'll see PR 1 to 5 to the north, about 2,300 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| And across from the Levi Powell Park, you'll see 6 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| 16 dwelling units an acre, 5 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| You'll see RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| RB allows up to 12 dwelling units an acre as of right and up to 24 through use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| Interestingly, the RA zone allows, as of right, 4 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| There's a minimum of 10,000 square foot lots for single-family residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| that are served by sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| And so you can, well, in theory, the math would be 4.356 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| but with the lot sizes being minimum, you can only do four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| It also allows duplexes at 12,000 square feet per lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| and you can put two units on a 12,000-square-foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| which would be 7-point-something dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| if you were to develop it as duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| With the LDR restriction, you'd be limited to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| So if you look at the zones that are there and the community that is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| then between four and five dwelling units an acre is certainly consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| with the zoning and the sector plan and the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| and that's why the applicant is still asking for that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| I know I'm running out of time, about a minute left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| and you've heard this argument before, but I always think it bears repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| I mean, there is a proportional connection to the quality of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| and the affordability of housing with greater density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| When you have property that here, it meets the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| it meets the growth policy plan, it's relatively flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| there are similar developments that have been developed at this density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| When you can have that flexibility, you can build a better-quality unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| You can build units that are then also more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| because there's an economy of scale that goes into all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| So we're not asking for anything that's out of range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| with what has been approved in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| or out of range with what type of zoning is already there in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| I do know that the developer does want to have there to be pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| to Levi Powell Park there that it's adjacent to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| and that will help maybe alleviate some of the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| at least from this development, to the park during those times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| So I think this is an opportunity to maybe address some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| We have growth. It's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| This is the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| We'd ask that you approve the five dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| that the applicant requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Chair will recognize Commissioner Paff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| I think on this one, the staff has it exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| I think three-and-a-half to the acre is what fits in right out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| with the rest of what's around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| I move that we approve staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| up to three-and-a-half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| For the comments, we have a motion by Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Second by Commissioner Adams to approve the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| for staff's recommendation at 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Hearing none, the motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| Next is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| This is agenda item number 10, file 9821RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| The applicant is Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| Location, north side of Ball Road, northeast of Ball Camp Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| southwest of Lobetti Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Size of tract is 19.31 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| Present zoning is RA low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| Requested zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| Density proposed five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| Staff recommendation, approve PR planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| because it is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| The applicant is present, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2730)|

| 0:46:11| We are at the adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| We have been in that location for one on 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| We share a tract of land about 16.5 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| right to the south-southwest of the proposed site for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2781)|
| 0:46:30| We're not against rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| We're not against improvements for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Our biggest concern is water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| If you look at the map toward the north portion of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| that is set for rezoning, it is very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| It goes up some 0.5% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| And all that water that runs south of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| when it crosses over our land, it goes right through our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| Currently, the water, when we have a heavy rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| it comes within 30 feet of the house, within one foot out of our barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| And it has flooded numerous times, and it has destroyed our culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| It's about a two-inch pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| And our neighbor's culvert south of it, we have to continuously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| I can take this off now. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| We have to continuously be cognizant of the different changes of our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| I do have photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| I understand you can't see them here, but we can't submit it as evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| But we have the flooding area, and I don't think that's been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| We understand there are engineering controls that would be put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| but based on our current situation and what's proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| a greater density area, up to five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| You all approve up to three already, 12 inch per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| But five, in our opinion, may be excessive unless you have more stringent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| engineering controls in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| And that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| My name is Dr. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| I have been in this community for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| We have a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| We have our farm, and I am about ready to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| And now this program is coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| As repeated, I understand that progress should be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| The problem is it's the amount of houses that are being proposed to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| into such a small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| Water, as I said, runs down into our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| And where they're proposing to do this building is in the lower part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| area, of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| When that happens and we have rain, then we become overran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| I believe we will become overran with the amount of water that will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| We also have a pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Our pond has fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| As a result of that water and all that sediment, then all the fishing that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| done and all the fishing that I have, the ponds that I've created, all my fish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| will die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| I have large amounts of bass in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| So I have a vast investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| We have a vast investment in our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| And we are very much concerned about how much damage will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| Remember, developers are developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| They aren't living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| What happens is that we end up living in a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| They're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Maybe they should have a little joke that developers should live on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| downstream of where they develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| And I assure you that that house or wherever they're developing will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| excellent because they live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Thank you, Dr. Jackson, Mr. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Victor Jernigan, 229 Sherway Road, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| I removed this item from the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| I'm the one that asked for it to be removed from consent because I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| the opportunity to discuss with the commission the ability to modify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| staff report of three dwelling units an acre up to a density of five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| dwelling units an acre based on four primary factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| The first is the location of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| As the staff report shows, this property fronts Ball Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| but it's less than 500 feet from the intersection of Bakertown and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| new Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| Late next year when Shod Road is finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| it will be carrying between 20,000 and 30,000 cars a day and have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| significant impact on Ball Road, which is now used as the cross-county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| As the new road is developed, the traffic on Ball Road will decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| significantly, and if there's ever an opportunity for increased density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| it is near a major arterial collector, which this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| Additionally, the intersection of Bakertown and Shod Road is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| zoned for a planned commercial area, and there is active consideration for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| that development right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| The second issue is the planned residential density of five units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3086)|
| 0:51:34| acre allows for a consideration of a type and diversity of housing which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| just not practical at a lesser density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| The Jacksons have an unbelievably beautiful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| I mean, I've been there several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| It is the kind of property everybody should want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| We are extremely sensitive to water runoff issues and have looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| from the very beginning that we undertook this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| So the ability to increase the density, it may seem counterintuitive to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| neighbors, but you as commissioners and at the planning staff, it gives us the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| flexibility to look at all kinds of different building designs which allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| us more open space and stormwater controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| The third issue builds right on what the previous zoning was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| This property, as you go up in density, it needs to have excellent line of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| sight to be able to handle the increased density to get on and off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| The zoning sign that is there has more than a thousand feet of visibility in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| each direction now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| And that leads to the fourth issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| You have a copy of the letter that I mailed to all of the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| including the Jacksons, which goes, if I may read the first paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| it's to each of the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| I am requesting the Knox County Planning, the Knox Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| rezone 19.3 acres of Albert and Barbara Griffith property from agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| zone to a low-density residential zone of five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| I'm very clear on this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| This is on the September 9th meeting agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| This land does adjoin your home, and I want to keep you informed about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| rezoning and development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| I then go on and explain the timeline and what's involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| And I'm very glad that the Jacksons were able to speak today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| the only other person who has called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| And let me go back to right now Ball Road is carrying thousands of cars in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| traffic today that it will not be carrying in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| The only comment that I have received is from a neighbor who said he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| certainly in favor of me building 100 units and more if I could because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| Knoxville is desperate for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| It is for these reasons that I ask the commission to modify the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| recommendation and approve my request of five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| Thank you, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| Chair will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Victor, can you just kind of help us understand what the plan is for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| water control just so that, you know, the property next door to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| Jacksons, the ponds that they have invested in are protected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| So, again, we've only done the preliminary outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| There's a wet weather conveyance that is coming just behind the former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| Griffith home and also goes on to the Jackson property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| We've already had engineers look at how we're going to cross that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| particular little wetland conveyance on the property to make sure we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| going to be impacting anything there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| We've looked at there's a pond that had been dug out on up on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| It's dry today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| And we're looking at using that to redirect and recapture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| Especially if we get to larger density, we'll be able to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| redirecting the flow of the water coming off the hillside into that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| and use that as a retention area, a pond area that is not in existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| or being used today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| It's completely dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| So we have looked at several different options to control the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| but we haven't gone into full engineering yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| just simply because we need the density to be able to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| alternatives that we want to have in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| We are, however, quite serious and concerned about making sure that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| whatever is developed does not impact the Jackson property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| They are, as I said, they have a beautiful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| At what time do these water conveyances actually take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| Because I'm thinking about the process of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| and I'm thinking about those ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| And if those don't really go into place until things are really done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| what happens as the process is just beginning and all of that earth that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| moved becomes silt that affects the ponds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| The issue of water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| water controls to stop the runoff from moving on to another piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| property is always a difficult situation when you have massive storm events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| But as a normal course of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| the way this property would be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| the storm water controls would be part of the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| especially with the larger density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| We'll be able to space the buildings so that the storm water controls will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| be easy to develop along with the actual construction of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| So we view the storm water controls would be going in first before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| actual construction of the buildings would be going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| You said especially with the larger density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| Why would the density have any impact on when you actually conducted those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| The storm water will be going in no matter how the project goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| The storm water will be going in before the actual buildings are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| It doesn't make any difference whether it's houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Those are just the things that are required to do under today's development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| So the storm water controls will be going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| If we use a single family housing as single family houses would be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| the storm water controls tend to take a different configuration than if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| you're building stacked flat type structures with eight or ten units in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Then you can put more smaller storm water controls between the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| You have more opportunity to do some real quality water containment issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| when you have more open space that you control between the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| I hope I didn't stutter too much there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| I wanted to ask if engineering could comment on the use of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| pond as storm water retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| It's not a pond, Mr. Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| It's just a hole in the ground right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| Commissioner, could you speak more directly into the mic so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| understand a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| I wanted to ask if engineering could comment on the use of the hole in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| ground, whether that's a pond or a sinkhole or what, as a future retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| pond, if that's something that seems like it would be a viable option and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| how that would affect during the construction process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| As part of that process, we would ask Victor or any developer, for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| matter, to install those ponds off Jump Street before they get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| Like he said, that's just best practice, and we ask that they do that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| part of their permit requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| And as far as using that pond, the existing pond as a detention pond down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| the road, that would be perfectly acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| It's something we do all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| And this question is going to be for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| Again, still learning the whole slope analysis thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| So my understanding is this has a very steep slope in the back part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| property, the idea being that we wanted to start that as least amount as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| So why would we not go with a higher density on the lower part to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| that upper part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| So I'm just looking for some help on still trying to understand this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| The slope analysis is just one of the factors that we look at in making a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| recommendation for density on a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| So the slope analysis for this recommended 2.68 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| However, we looked at what the surrounding zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| It's largely RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| And the majority of the planned residential zoning that is up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| dwelling units an acre is on the other side of Ball Road within that mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| use special district that was called out in the northwest county sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| So it's just one of many things that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| It's not the only thing that guides our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| Could I make a comment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| Is there any way I could make another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Yeah, Ms. Jackson, I think you still have a little more time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| The way our property is done is that across from no matter his drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| the hill, the way the hill is sloped, he has to come down and then the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| goes up on that property that he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| The water is going to be an issue no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| And it's going to drain into our pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| I am not against developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| What I am against is the number of units, the number of units that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| He wants to develop these units where there are so many people packed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| against each other, you have to spit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| When you spit, you'd hit the window in the next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| That's how bad it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| And what I would like is that at least the commission to at least keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3687)|
| 1:01:35| as it is, not as he recommends, but as you recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| At least it would keep the integrity of our farm and of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| And that's what I was requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Thank you, Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Real quick, Mr. Jernigan, we're really at this point deliberating or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| As the letter that I have sent the neighbors indicates, I am perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| and willing, able, willing, and want to keep the neighbors involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| I sent a letter in advance of the meeting telling the neighbors exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| what was going to happen and exactly what I was going to ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| I keep this commitment going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| We would like the opportunity to design and see if we can get up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| We don't know that we can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| It may wind up being a development of three and a half, four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| But I certainly would like the opportunity to look at a design and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| what we can come up with at the five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| I've demonstrated my commitment to keep the neighbors informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| and I will continue to keep the neighbors informed and work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| Jacksons as we move forward with the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| Again, I appreciate their concerns, but I ask the commission to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| the opportunity to look at a density of five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Okay, just along this density thing, the staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| three and a half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Now, correct me, that's based on the entire track size, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| That means the land in the back, the hillside, is not going to be touched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| the steep stuff you can't develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| So you're going to calculate and get density based on that unusable land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| and you're going to concentrate that density on the usable lower part, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| So you're actually, on the flat stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| you're going to be at five units an acre possibly, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| So what we're looking at is a development of about 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| How big are the lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| If we do the 100-unit development, we'll be using either a combination of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| townhomes and stacked flats, or we'll be using a construction similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| what an architectural style called a big house plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| It's eight and ten units in a building that looks like a large house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| If you have seen the development, the villas on Wallace Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| the buildings that are at that development are examples of that kind of structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| Those are attached units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| All attached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| And basically a two-story building, two units to a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Eight to ten units in a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| But if you were going to do detached single family, three and a half units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| that's probably a reasonable number on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| I don't think you could get any more than that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| It would be hard to get more than three and a half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| And that's the reason we're asking for the opportunity to look at the greater density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| because we do believe the property will easily support a 100-unit development with no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| What are you proposing to build, if not single family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| What are you proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| We're looking at a density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| If we have the opportunity to build at a greater density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| at three and a half units an acre, it will be a single family development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| If we have the ability to build at a greater density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| we will be building two-story condominium-style buildings that look like a large house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| The buildings are generally 8,000 to 12,000 square feet in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| As I said, each building will vary between six and ten units in a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| depending on the site configurations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| The Griffith home that is not part of this transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| but where they used to live on the corner of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| that's a 7,000 square foot house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| So the buildings that we would be building are much more, quite seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| much more in keeping with that house than any single family development could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| So if we're limited to the three and a half units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| it will be a single family development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| It's just you can't really afford the infrastructure to do more than what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| And what I'm asking for is that opportunity to look at what could be done to this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| because to get 500 feet from a road that will be carrying 20,000, 30,000 cars a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| is exactly the kind of location where density needs to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| Okay, I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| Chair recognizes Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| From what I'm looking at with the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| I don't necessarily think that the percentage of disturbance areas being like cumulatively assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| It's like a percentage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| So it looks like the large majority of density is in the non-hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| You're getting a recommended density of four dwelling units per acre for non-hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| And so, you know, the slope as it goes up in percentage, it's only cutting down, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| I mean, it looks like five or so dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| So I feel like, you know, the average of three rounds up what staff is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| I don't think that the hillside is affecting, you know, the density nearly as much as we seem to think that it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| So I think staff recommendation is spot on personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| So I'll let Commissioner Adams speak, but I would like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| I just wanted to say that while I always appreciate learning more about what the potential development is, this is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| So whatever we do to this property right now, that is the zone that we're placing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| I think that needs to be considered as well as we're thinking this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| That I feed to Commissioner Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| I've got a question for Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| If the tract is 19.3 acres and roughly nine acres less is in the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4070)|
| 1:08:00| and if you stay off that, then you're looking at essentially about 10, 100 units on 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4080)|
| 1:08:09| We've got a calculation of about 11.5 acres, but that's probably a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| So you're looking at 100 units on 11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| So the density in that area is going to be about 10 or 11 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| And that would, again, if we are able to use these larger buildings with more units in the buildings, that's two-story buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4101)|
| 1:08:30| so you've got units up and units down, then the 11 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| there are multiple, multiple developments in the city and the county that use this type of design that are built out at 20 and 30 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4114)|
| 1:08:45| So the 10 units that we would be able to allocate creates actually buildings that are similar in size to the house that is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| but more importantly, it also creates more open space because instead of having houses side by side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| we have larger buildings with more open space around the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| It gives us the flexibility to look at other design options and that's all that we're asking for because it is a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| and we have to come back with a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| We have to come back with a plan that shows how we're going to develop the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| and how we're going to handle the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| We've never wanted and never proposed to build on the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| I asked for a hillside analysis before I did anything with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| After I put the property under contract, the very first thing I did was call and ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| and pay for a hillside analysis on the property so that we could look at what the density would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| Thank you, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Yeah, just brought up a good point that one of the basic reasons for planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4177)|
| 1:09:48| is to concentrate housing on the usable part of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| and leave the part that would really give you a problem to develop, leave it free and clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4193)|
| 1:10:02| and not be as it is now like in RA where you have to have a certain size lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4202)|
| 1:10:11| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| And the fact that they're going to eight or ten units, I think they've got a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| and it's good use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| It's good zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| It's good if they go to the PR and develop the way they say they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| Mr. Jernigan has been around a long time, and I think he's a responsible developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4234)|
| 1:10:42| If he stands here and tells us this is what he has in mind, I think that that's what we'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| I move that we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| Commissioner Graf, I think Commissioner Dent was going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| Has made a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| No, she has not, but she was going to allow Ms. Adams to speak next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| Well, she gave a comment yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Yeah, I'm going to allow Commissioner Graf to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| It seems appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| I don't feel anything either way, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| I just wanted to also say to Commissioner Adams' point that, you know, I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| I'm a newer commissioner, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| So I don't know developers and their track record, as some of you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| And with this being a rezoning, from what I'm gathering, you know, if you have the higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| you have potential opportunity to do multifamily housing is what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| If you've got the lower density, you have an opportunity to do maybe single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| And so I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| I really do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| I feel like that's getting into you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| And we're very early to be saying, okay, well, let's give, you know, this density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| And what I'm hearing is that, like, if you don't get the density, then it's going to be single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| If you give the density, then it's going to be multi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| And I think it's we're not supposed to focus on the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| I get the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| But with that being said, I'd recommend or like to make a motion to approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| I'd like to make a motion to approve PR up to three dwellings per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Motion a second before we go to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Chair will recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| I just I agree with I don't disagree with you, but I agree with Commissioner Graff in the sense that we are giving him an opportunity to be a little more imaginative and to increase potentially green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4360)|
| 1:12:54| And that always seems to be some of our concerns here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| So I hope we'll all consider that when we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Chair recognizes Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| I think that this would be a perfect opportunity to share some conversations I've had with Director Brooks and some of the other community representatives over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4387)|
| 1:13:20| Two of them are sitting in the audience right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| We all know that we ought to concentrate density in the developable areas, and I think this would be a good developable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4403)|
| 1:13:30| What I have been a proponent for recently is if you are at the higher range of the zone density, so in a low density residential, anything above three, three and a half, you're getting towards four or five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4410)|
| 1:13:46| You ought to be able to provide some sort of example of how you can justify that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| It's not just something that the land gets given by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| So I'm going to continue to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| I think Commissioner Smith has brought up some things about other things that he wants to keep pounding on the table about until they get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| That one would be one that I think we ought to consider as we go forward with County Commission and some other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| Because I think that we are going to have a challenge in the next five to ten years in getting good developments, getting density that we need, but not opening up the floodgates for random acts of not good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4452)|
| 1:14:28| So I think there's a compromise there, so I wanted to get that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| No other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4476)|

| 1:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Next is agenda item number 12, file 9C21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4554)|
| 1:16:03| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Staff is recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| The applicant is Joshua Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Location, north side of Chambliss Avenue, north of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| and west of North Forest Park Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| Tract is 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| Present zoning is RN4, general residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| Zoning requested office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| Currently used as a single family residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| Staff recommendation, deny office zoning because the property does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| meet the dimensional requirements of the zoning district and would present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| difficulty in meeting requirements for parking, buffering, and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Josh Bishop, 4820 Old Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| Mr. Bishop, there are no one else to sign up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| We're requesting office zoning here to extend the office zoning on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| Chambliss Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| As you can see on the map, there's probably six houses that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| converted to office immediately to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| There are ten houses that have previously been to the north that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| been converted to office zoning on Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| So what we're requesting is the extension of the office zoning to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| We haven't received any negative feedback from any of the neighbors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| we've spoken with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| I don't believe anybody is here in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| You know, I really appreciate staff's comments as to the size of the lot and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| some of the difficulties that we'll face with office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| But we feel like this zoning is keeping with the neighborhood and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| character of the Bearden Village, which is designed to be a mixed use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| office and commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| And so what we are asking is to go ahead and move this to office so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| can get the highest and best use out of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| Thank you, Mr. Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| Staff, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| Before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| Chair will recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| I hope that many of you are familiar with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| These are small parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| In this block, there are roughly 24 parcels that are office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| There are roughly 11 that are in four and three parcels, roughly that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Clearly, there's been a shift from residential over the years to small offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| And I think this really benefits the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| If you look at the mix of businesses, small businesses over there, it's a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| that a business owner can afford their own space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| And it's hard to do that any place in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| So I would support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| I would ask staff, I guess, because of the dimensional standard, one, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4753)|
| 1:19:21| changed during recode, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| The dimensional standard is correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| The lot size, specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| Excuse me, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| So I think we, I don't know if it was unintended or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| It appears to be unintended because we clearly saw the shift to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| in this whole block, in that whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| So I think I would certainly support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| So I understand what Commissioner Hill is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| We were actually, this is a piece of property that I know Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4800)|
| 1:20:07| as well as Director Brooks talked to the Recode Commission about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| And, you know, there's been a considerable amount of resources that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| dedicated towards mixed use in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| The idea on keeping those residential as opposed to zoning them office was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4820)|
| 1:20:27| they would provide that residential component to Bearden Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| It's close to three bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| Panera Commercial Development is right in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| It is ideal for someone who doesn't want to drive, who wants to live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| take mass transportation, walk to Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| This is what we need, and this is what the community and the city has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| working for in this Bearden Village area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| You know, I understand, sir, that you'd like to convert this to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| I just feel that given the fact that this was just less than two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| that this map was approved by commission, approved by city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| that we need to stick with our decision to zone that RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| I know by having, I think, I remember questioning why it was zoned RN-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| instead of RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| I think kind of the idea was that if someone was able to purchase all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| those properties, they could use some connected townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| and increase that density and be an example of what we want for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| So I'm going to support staff's recommendation to deny this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4893)|
| 1:21:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| I think Commissioner Hill brought up a previous case down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| where fairly recently we approved an office rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4913)|
| 1:22:01| And I think consistency is good here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| and I hate to have a different side of this than Commissioner Midas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| because I respect her, but I just, in my view of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| I would be supportive of approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| But it is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| You know, it's hard to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| I mean, that's an area that's kind of got a little bit of everything right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| I don't know that either way this goes, it's going to hurt or make the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4946)|
| 1:22:35| But anyway, I would be supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| I'd like to hear some other people's opinion before I made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| I just wanted to point out to Commissioner Midas' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| the office zoning does allow for all residential types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| so there is still potential for this entire row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| this entire block really to be all types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| I have a question for staff on parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| Could they put parking in the front of the unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| or does it have to be in the rear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=4993)|
| 1:23:20| I believe Curtis from city engineering is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| This is one of the challenges with us recommending approval on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| So it's not so much the use that staff had specific concerns with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5011)|
| 1:23:39| but it was recommending something that we knew would be in conflict with the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| and would create potential nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| But I'll turn it over to Curtis to answer the question about parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| With regards to parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| it is a little bit difficult to create a parking scenario here that would meet the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5035)|
| 1:24:03| Of course, every site has to be looked at individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| and it may be that there is room to get the required parking on this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| but until we had probably a specific site plan to be able to know and specific measurements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| it would be hard to say exactly how much you could or could not fit onto the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5060)|
| 1:24:32| Commissioner Hill, Commissioner Midas, your flight is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| Do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| I have a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Is shared parking allowed in the office designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| Because I know in this particular community there is a lot of shared parking along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5082)|
| 1:24:55| I can try to help out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| The only zone that requires required parking to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| or the only uses that have required parking on the lot itself is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| Mike, you might want to grab somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| I'm not sure if that mic is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| This is harder to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Let me try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Speak up a little more, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| So the only uses that require parking to be on the lot that the use is located on are residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| So an office use could have their parking offsite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| It may not technically be shared parking per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| but it may be parking that they lease on another property that isn't required for another use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5135)|
| 1:25:45| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Yes, I was just going to make one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| So I think one of my fears with this rezone is just like what Commissioner Hill said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| It's a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| I wasn't on commission in 2019 when that was voted on prior to that rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| but I do see this as a precedent going forward if we were to rezone this office from residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5162)|
| 1:26:11| Chair recognizes Commissioner Wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Well, I mean, as far as precedent, I think it's already set in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| And I agree with Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| But one of my questions is, is somebody living in the house now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| Is it actually being used as a residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| How long has it been since somebody's lived here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| Probably six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| You know, just by coincidence, the property that we rezoned, what, a year or so ago, it's still vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| It's an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| The one that we recommended rezoning over a year ago is still vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| Nobody's done anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| Anyway, is there a motion of Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| I just wanted to respond to Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| A lot of times I would look at a space and agree and say, yeah, it looks like the decision has already been made or this is the climate is already being turned into more of a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5220)|
| 1:27:13| But I think it's actually still very much in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| And the code being written as it is, we're being guided by that to say there's a parking issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| This particular property doesn't work for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| There may be others along that that do, that don't have that same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| But this one is saying it doesn't fit that commercial code or the office code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5250)|
| 1:27:41| Thank you for your generosity, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| I don't think we know that there's a parking deficiency, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| And secondly, we can have, it allows for shared parking or off-site parking or options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5267)|
| 1:27:56| We have, we have parcels, numerous parcels in this particular area that uses off-site and shared parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| It's a common practice in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Am I missing then what the staff's recommendation or the reason for denial is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| When we went over this in agenda review, there was a concern about the width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| Maybe I used the wrong terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| There's an access issue related to automobiles that is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| That is the reason for denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| And I'll turn it over to Gene and Ms. Stephens in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Yeah, there is, it doesn't meet the lot requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| And it also, there is a number of other dimensional standards that it doesn't meet once it transitions to office or it's rezoned to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5316)|
| 1:28:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| Ms. Stephens, you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| Yes, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| What we discussed at the agenda review was related more to the buffering requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| What this would do is move the zoning district boundaries so that there is essentially about 10 feet of separation right now between this property and the one adjoining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5332)|
| 1:29:00| And there is a requirement when non-residential district abuts a residential district that there be a buffer yard at least 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| And that's what we were saying is that would be literally almost impossible to achieve without destroying the structure that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5347)|
| 1:29:16| If I may address a couple of the comments that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| Mr. Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| Commissioner, do you want to hear from Mr. Bishop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| Yes, just to clarify a couple of the topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| With respect to the buffer, of course, right now we're on the R4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| So to the west of us is right now the transitional area between office and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| And there is not any present buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| So it's not as if we are taking a buffer down and it's going to be a problem in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| It's just in that neighborhood it's not being done right now and hasn't historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| And with respect to the size of the lot being 7,500 feet, if you'll look at most of the 16 office lots around there, I think only four actually exceed that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5396)|
| 1:30:07| So it's not as if we are coming in at 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| And that is out of character for all of the houses on that street and on Southern Avenue behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| So I just wanted to make sure that everybody understood both of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| Thank you, Mr. Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Mr. Bishop, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| I know you said that the house is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Have you been actively trying to rent it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| We have looked at multiple ways of trying to utilize the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| We actually looked at also doing a VRBO for a temporary short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| Of course, that's not actually conducive in the current zoning either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| So we're trying to just evaluate what's the highest and best use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| But we feel like office is the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| So you aren't trying to get it like a long-term renter in your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| Not at this point, not with this in process and trying to transition the house to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5462)|
| 1:31:10| And you could do a VRBO if someone was a primary resident in that house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| You could do a VRBO if it was someone's primary residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| I think you're correct about that, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| Okay, we've talked about it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| And in an effort to move things along, I will make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| not that I'm dedicated to go to the wall on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| but I'm going to make a motion that we approve the office zoning on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5495)|

| 1:37:09| so we thought having PR3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| on that corner between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5831)|

| 1:37:17| and allow us an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| to do a little bit different product in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5839)|

| 1:37:39| With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| respect, I do ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5861)|

| 1:37:51| ask for approval of the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5871)|

| 1:38:01| to look at some different products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5881)|

| 1:38:17| just say through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| per staff's recommendation instead of reading it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Chair will recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Commissioner Ooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| So, I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| that we're clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| We had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| long discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| about a piece of property further east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| that was more in the center part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Hardin Valley there at Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| where we were discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| the CA versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| commercial, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| on that particular piece, we thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| it was more appropriate for the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| Here, are we completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| eliminating all the CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| I think staff had a map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| but we're saving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| house down on the corner of Marietta Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| so that's going to be a two-acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| and there was about a 50-foot gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| between there and the existing commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| zoning line, so we were wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| that commercial zoning along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| Marietta Church and Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| to abut that two-acre lot that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| going to save, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| CA is no longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| after the 2000 adoption of the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| allowed out here, so CR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| is the next available thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| and honestly, there's nothing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| we would intend to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| our two subdivisions that we're currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| trying to develop that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| we would need CA for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| It just seemed cleaner since it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| zoned CA for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| I think since 1950,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| We're reducing the CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| but in order to be contiguous and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| have a 50-foot strip of PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| CR was just the fill-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| but that will work with anything we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| would desire to put there, which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| a... My point here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| is that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| reduce and eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| all of that higher-end commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| possibility of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| one more D for the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| I think is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| good step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| here, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| is there somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| ready to speak now? Well, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| two more lights on, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| you can make a motion, Commissioner, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| I don't even know what the heck I'm approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| Sector plan is the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| Sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| to the RSC Rural Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| and HP Hillside Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| for all the portions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| it suggests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| first staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Yeah. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| All right. We do have a motion, a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| before, but let me recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| and then Commissioner Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| Thank you. I think I'm thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| about the right case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| There was a question from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| about a tree line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| Yeah, actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| one of the neighbors that got a postcard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| that lives in one of my clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| products there in Vining Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| had called me. He was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| concerned about the trees along the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| and I explained to him that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| the county requires a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| 25-foot buffer from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| top of Bank, not from the center of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| It's a pretty wide creek. And then another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| 25-foot setback from there. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| is not our intention, much like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| when we developed his lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| that he now lives in, to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| any of those trees down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| And he was satisfied with that, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| in fact our intent and requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| to keep that buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| Chair recognizes Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| Graff. My question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| is for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6107)|

| 1:47:47| The reason for the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6467)|

| 1:47:59| There was some conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6479)|

| 1:48:17| some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| relief from the peripheral boundary because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| there's really no harm to the adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| properties. And we think that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| equally at play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| in here. I mean, there's an issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| Hardin Valley Road and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| the right-of-way is. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| I don't think that has actually been nailed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| exactly what the, whether it's 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| feet or 40 feet. And that's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| staff's concerns for doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| anything more than a 30-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| peripheral boundary instead of 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| But, you know, under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| these circumstances, we believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| this is more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| as a front yard setback, which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| 20 feet at the minimum, and we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| asking for that fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| And I think this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| that's come up many times. I think even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| there might be, this would come up on a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| in the future about maybe changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| this just to be a front yard setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| when it is a corner lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| or it's in the frontage of a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| we're asking for the staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| recommendation to be approved in every other respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| except reducing that peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| from 30 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6559)|

| 1:49:41| With staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| can I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| make sure I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| if I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| on parts of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| are you all requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| that they go ahead and dedicate the 40 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| or just saying whatever the county highway department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| comes up with, whether it's 35 or 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| you need to make sure that it gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| right-of-way dedicated and you're okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| with the peripheral setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| There's a discrepancy between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| what the parcel map shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| which is 40 feet of right-of-way right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| and what they're showing on their concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| of 35 feet to dedicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| right-of-way on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| I don't know if the 40-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| right-of-way on the parcel map is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| At this point, I would assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| that their engineer is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| with the 35-foot dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| But if it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| dedicated at 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| and the way the conditions are written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| the peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| recommendation is 35 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| to maintain the 35-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Basically, what we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| is needed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| is that from the centerline of Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| there's 70 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| between the centerline of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| to the building line on Lot 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| which would be a 35-foot right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| and a 35-foot peripheral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| So if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| 40-foot right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| if there actually is a 40-foot right-of-way there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| then we're comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| a 30-foot peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| Did that answer your question, Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| Yeah, I think it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| I don't know that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| I think you're referencing condition number 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| if the existing Hardin Valley road right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| is greater than 35 feet along the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| of the property, the applicant must obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| approval from Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| to close a portion of the Hardin Valley road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| Is that what you're referring to, right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| So there still will be some analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| Some work to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| Okay. Well, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| that we approve variances 1 and 2 on the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| of Knox County Community Public Works Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| because we want greater traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| We have a motion by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| seconded by Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| To approve variances 1 and 2 per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| that we approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| variance 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| What about variance 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| Well, I'm trying to see if I need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| do that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6745)|
| 1:52:33| Yeah, I don't want to do that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| I want to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| and just suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| that whatever rights-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| that the County Highway Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| is requiring, whether it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| 40 feet or 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| they're required to dedicate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| and then the peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| 25 feet from whatever that point is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| I think so. I mean, if we don't know yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| I mean, that might give us flexibility to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| the 25-feet peripheral boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| which would allow the lot to be developed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| and if it's not that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| then, you know, we have an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| but we don't want to pin ourselves in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| where we have a lot that's undevelopable right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| without having all of this work completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| There's plenty of room to buffer that between the right-of-ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| so that would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| So your motion, Commissioner, would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| basically granting a 25-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| from Hardin Valley Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| variance number 3, I just wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| what this one's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| It's actually for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| the reduction of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| vertical curve coming from Hardin Valley up onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| or I guess the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| vertical curve of the new road coming down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| going from a K of 25 to a K of 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| Engineering is okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| reduction as long as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| building site is 70 feet from centerline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| of Hardin Valley, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| if that building line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| is closer than 75 feet to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| centerline, then engineering is not in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| K-value reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6847)|
| 1:54:21| I can see the brain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| working. It's turning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6863)|
| 1:54:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6873)|
| 1:54:43| I don't know how to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| because I think the peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| will be 25 feet. I think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| dedication is going to be what it is, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| if there's an issue with the vertical curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| that's a different conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| Counselor, than just a peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| setback. So somebody's going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| help me with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| The highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| department, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| 40 or 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| with how that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| goes in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| are you worried about a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| access? What's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| for the separation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| The big thing for us on that vertical curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| we do K's of 15 all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| time when we're widening roads, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| allowing it to go down to that point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| no problem with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| Really just worried about that building and its proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| to the right-of-way, because Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| through there, it's a two-lane road, about 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| 21 foot wide. It's something we're going to have to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| We're worried about getting those side slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| tied in. Likely we'll have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| sidewalks or other pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| facilities. We're going to have a pretty wide footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| coming through there with any kind of improvement that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| going to do, so we just would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| not ham ourselves in on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6949)|
| 1:56:00| Engineering, could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| offer a suggestion to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| Uten's motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| Might help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| I think that we could leave that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| the approval of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| County Engineering based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| what they discover on the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| because we don't even know what the right-of-way is yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| right? I think that's an open issue. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| I think we'd be fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| talking through that later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| as far as getting that K value exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| The main concern, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| is getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| against that peripheral setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| keeping it at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| I think we had talked about 70 foot on the centerline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| Any other motions to leave it alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| Or maybe a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| we revisit this once we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| with the concept plan, there's 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| If we take out condition number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| that's the one referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| the peripheral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| Let's leave that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| right-of-way confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| from County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| and just remove that condition altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| I don't know if that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| throw a monkey wrench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| in the rest of the approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| And then there's also, on the third one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| there's condition number two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| that addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7048)|
| 1:57:40| I don't have an issue with the peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| what I'm hearing the county say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| is if they widen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| Hardin Valley, that there would be a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| issue with tying in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| how the existing subdivision road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| goes in with the old Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| as it relates to where the house would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| from a peripheral setback standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| We can make sure that driveway stays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| on the upper portion of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| and we can make sure that that home is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| impacted by any potential side slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| of the improved road that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| and I think we would be good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| As long as we don't have a driveway right up there next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| Hardin Valley Road, that's where we would run into issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7098)|

| 2:09:24| We ended up realigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| that intersection of Pickery Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| and Portland Valley. Took that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| terrible 90 degree curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| and we are installing a roundabout there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| as a partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| with that development. So it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| similar type improvement there. We just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| haven't got the partnership nailed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| yet. Excuse me, Mr. Fritz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| I apologize. Are you speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| into your mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| I have two mics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| It's a little difficult for me to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| but I'm my age maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| Does that one work? That works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| much better, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| I'll put that one away then. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| How much of that did you miss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| Do you want me to repeat all of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| Just continue please. All right. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| My fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| My only point, Aaron, was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| I understand we'll have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| financial contribution and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| obviously we've offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| right-of-way dedication contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| since we controlled both corners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| the full weight of the intersection improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| is not burdened on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| project with this approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| That's what I'm trying to clarify here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| I think the only other thing was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| we had asked for on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| a handful of lots that back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| to the inset subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| that y'all just approved for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| a periphery setback reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| all the way down to the minimum of 15 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| since it was another new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| development going in and there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| residents, no homeowners there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| Staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| recommended 25. We're okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| with that. We can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| shift everything 10 foot to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| and make that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| by reducing the lot depths on the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| side of the property adjacent to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| With that, I'll respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| ask for approval of the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7882)|
