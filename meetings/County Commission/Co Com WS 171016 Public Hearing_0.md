| 0:00:30| I call this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| meeting of a public hearing for the purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=36)|
| 0:00:40| appointing interviewing candidates for the ethics to openings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| on the Ethics Committee to order. Madam Clerk, will you call roll, please? Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=44)|
| 0:00:48| Gill. Present. Commissioner Carringer is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=48)|

| 0:01:00| Commissioner Skinmaker. Here. Commissioner Anders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| Commissioner Bessler. Commissioner Wright. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| Commissioner Daley. Here. Commissioner Thomas. Here. Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=72)|
| 0:01:20| OK. How does everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| proceed with this? Do we want to hear from each candidate individually as we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| Yeah. Normally we would go down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| line here alphabetically and just hear from them all and then we don't make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| a decision until Monday anyway. Right. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| Tony Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| OK. How about we skip him and go to Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| Mr. Chairman, are you going to put him on a clock or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| Five minutes is probably good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Anthony Brown. Excuse me. I stepped out a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=120)|
| 0:02:24| Good evening, sir. Go ahead. You have the floor for five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| OK. My name is Anthony Brown. Most of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| I had applied several years ago and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| was ill and had to step back. I love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| this county. I love this city. My family's been here since 1791| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| and I feel like I own a part of it and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| really, really care about it. I come to most of the meetings for the last six or seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| years and I just want to serve and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| see if there's another way I can get back. I've been serving on the Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| Board for two years. I love that and I've been mixed up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| different parts of county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| government trying to do what I can and be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| and keep up with all the new things that's going on. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| many different aspects where you can serve, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| really like to be involved with the Ethics Committee. I think I could do a good job at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| I understand that it's not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| going out and looking for ethical problems. You only deal with the problems that they send to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| I would like to serve and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| use my experience. I'm not a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| but I've been in management many years and I really love the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| and I love to keep things on the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| end of things to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| everything's on the up and up. We have lots of things that go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| on everywhere and you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| police everywhere, you can't take care of everywhere, but I'd like to make a difference here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| So I hope you vote for me to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| on the committee and I will serve you proudly and I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| do the best I can to my ability and I will seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| out all information when any problem comes up that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| have to vote on and I hope that I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| make you proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| Are there any questions for Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Anything else you'd like to add, sir? No, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| really like to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| I'm probably going to ask this question of all the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| Do you have any family members that work for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| None whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| Tony, what district do you live in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| I live in City District 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| County District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Did you need me to give my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| It's on the resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| Next we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| Michael Covington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=332)|
| 0:05:46| Good evening, everyone. I'm Michael Covington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| 2566 Brooks Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| I'm really excited to be here. This opportunity to serve on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| Ethics Committee is new to me and I've been doing a lot of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| about it and I think that this is a good opportunity for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| I'm looking forward to hopefully having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| opportunity to serve on the Ethics Committee and provide good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| service, obviously. I'm very active in the community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| I've been involved in a lot of projects over the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| and I think that I'm finally coming to realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| there is a positive end to this. There's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| development going on in my community and I'm really excited about that and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| some of the things that we've done over the last several years have promoted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| Looking forward to hopefully moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| forward a project that will in some ways mimic the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| Hundred Oaks Project in Nashville that puts a medical center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| in areas where there aren't medical facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| We're continuing to expand our East Knoxville Community Meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| which several of our sitting county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| spoke at our December meeting last year. What we're hoping to do is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| continue to spread information and disseminate information to the residents of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| County Commission District 1. I think that that will spur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| a lot of enthusiasm for growth and development in the area and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| certainly a lot of room for that. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| that we're approaching a time in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| history, in our city and our county's history, where there are some really good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| that are going to be happening and we need good people to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| forward, step forward, take leadership roles and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| expand our involvement in local government. That's one of the reasons why I think it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| very good for me to serve on this committee, to be able to, again, disseminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| information about the fact that there are good things going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| on in government and we need to be mindful of the fact that there is a lot that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| happening in local government that affects the lives of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| people in our communities. I'm excited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| get an opportunity to do this, to serve on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| I think there are just a lot of things that can be accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| by different citizens stepping forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| getting involved in the political process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| Commissioner Nystrom? Michael, gosh, it seems like all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| know you really well. You've run for a couple offices and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| are, as far as I can tell, pretty well known in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| A lot of your community service, I've seen, is in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| community, but also out in the, for lack of a better word, political world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| The Ethics Commission is non-political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| If anything, being kind of an island out of politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| is almost better for something like this, the Ethics Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| Can you tell us, as much as you're out there in the community and have been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| in politics and those sort of advocacy, how does that translate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| into serving on the Ethics Commission, which is more of a, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| a non-political organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| That's an excellent question, Hugh. Quite honestly, once you've run for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| once or twice, in my case, you take a step back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| and you find other ways to be effective and you find other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| to serve. Stepping away from the political aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| of things and just looking at something that, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| case of the Ethics Committee, it's a situation where you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| identifying with a situation and you're working through that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| with a team of others, essentially. That's not political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| For me right now, quite honestly, after you've run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| for office once or twice, you're really tired. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| political campaign fatigue that you go through. Right now, I'm throwing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| myself into our family business and to expand the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| activities that I was already involved with. There's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| transition from the political aspect of involvement to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| just purely serving a need of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Just to follow up, do you have any family members who work for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| I have a question that I actually want to ask you and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| Mr. Brown. Have you read the ethics policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Have you read the ethics procedures? Do you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| questions about either the policy or the procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| None at this moment. Pretty much I felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| like I understood exactly what the responsibilities were and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| the mission is. I may have some questions down the road, but right now I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| have a fair understanding of what the responsibility involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| You've studied a little bit about what the violations are and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| what the current violations are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| What constitutes an ethics violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=662)|
| 0:11:16| Any other questions for Mr. Covington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| I hope I get your last name right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Jed McKeon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Well done, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| My name's Jed McKeon and I'm an attorney here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| Knoxville, Tennessee. Born and raised here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| The question comes to my own mind, why in the world would I want to be involved in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| ethics committee? I'm an attorney. I have a full practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| And for me at least, when I find something that I want to be passionate about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| that is something I'm willing to give up my time to for you. Not so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| when I get asked to be involved in things that I appreciate and enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| but am not passionate about. So the past committees that I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| a part of, the school board and various committees, are things that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| have to be passionate about. One of those things is Knox County, I realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| I've been here my whole life. Raised in District 2 and went to Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| High School and now live in District 9, just south of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| outside of the city limits. And I just realized that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| I'm not on anything currently and being a part of an ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| as an attorney is something that I understand and have read the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| that you asked about, the policies and procedures. I understand what constitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| a violation under those rules and I feel like I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| be of benefit to the county in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| And no, I don't have any county employees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=768)|
| 0:12:56| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Thank you, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Well, Jennifer's not here. She's already spoken. She was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| nominated by the mayor as his choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| Billy Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| Mr. Chairman, Commission, thanks for this opportunity to address you on this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| I recently applied a few years back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| it wasn't very ethical the way they handled it back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| I think this commission here has restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| the public faith in our system and I would continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| to do that. And I currently have several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| volunteer positions within Knox County, but none that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| conflict with, not paid, they're all voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| I'm a community mediation center mediator in the Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| Criminal and Juvenile Court. And I have graduated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| from the Citizens Police Academy and currently a volunteer with the Senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Citizens Awareness Network for Knox County Sheriff, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| a visitation program for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| My mediation background, I think, would give me an insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| as to what we really need to come together with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| and work out problems. I can work out problems between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| different people and different viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| Mr. Nassar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| The question I said I would answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| or ask was, do you have any family members who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| are currently employed by Knox County? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| My question is, have you read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| the ethics policy and the procedures and understand them? Do you have any questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| them? No, sir. And what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| unethical about the last time you applied? I'm sorry, I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| understand you. You had said the last time you applied, you found that to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| unethical. Well, the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| at the time was open to the general public, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| we had several candidates there, and as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| spoke, in the situation we are now, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| were given basically the same amount of time, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| at the end, one of the sitting members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| proposed that all nominations cease, and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| There was no more talking to us, the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| They reappointed someone on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=940)|
| 0:15:48| And I assure you that anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| that comes before me, everyone will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| a right to express their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Okay, we've heard testimony from all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| I would like to remind commission that this does not close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| the candidates that can be nominated, that someone can come up between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| and Monday, or even show up on Monday and apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| and be nominated and voted in. Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| I just think it would be to kind of let them know, if they haven't been up here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| that as the item is called next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| that people will be, names will go around the room, everybody will make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| nomination, then we'll vote, then somebody that doesn't get six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| will drop off. We'll do a process to get both spots filled, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| it will be at the beginning of the meeting, fairly close to the beginning of the meeting on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| when the vote takes place. I think it's just to let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| they won't be here all night on Monday night, again. But thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| All I was wanting to have discussed was the process, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| the fellow commissioner covered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Does anyone have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| This meeting is adjourned. Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| Next week, let's do pink tie Monday, men. If you've got a pink tie, wear your pink tie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| and you'll be our last. Hey, pink shirt will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| Dave will come in in his pink suit, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| ladies, you can wear a pink dress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| Clear chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016PublicHearing?start=1056)|
