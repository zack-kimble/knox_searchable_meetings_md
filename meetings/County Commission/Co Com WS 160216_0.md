| 0:03:35| This is not to say what's going to be on the budget or not on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| This is to help us set our calendar so we'll know what dates we may be, well, I guess I've given you all the discussion already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=218)|
| 0:03:51| We will have that as a part of the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| Is there anything, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=237)|

| 0:04:55| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Is there anything else to add to the discussion of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=296)|
| 0:05:05| We will discuss resolutions 21, 22, 28, 30 through 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=305)|

| 0:05:19| Do we have anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| Do I hear a motion that the agenda be set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| It's properly before us that the agenda be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Madam Clerk, would you address the first item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| Item number 21 is consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| approving the necessary right-of-way slope drainage and construction easement acquisitions on six tracks for the Gibbs Middle School access road improvement project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=349)|
| 0:05:58| Resolution 405.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| I don't think y'all want me to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| And I'm not going to belabor this point on all of these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| but I will make a general statement in that I still strongly feel that we're moving out in haste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=382)|
| 0:06:31| and that's probably intentional, and I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| but I think we need to look at the repercussions of doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| and what the fallout will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| I think there's a mindset that if we get it constructed or in the ground even that there won't be any other fallout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| I think that's a bit short-sighted, and because I think the question is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| I think the question that the OCR is going to bring before the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| and potentially the mayor and county commission is going to be key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| So with that said, you know, I'm going to vote against these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| but again I'm not going to belabor the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| I think everyone knows how I feel about this and why I feel the way I feel about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| I will say I've gotten a lot of e-mails, and I've seen in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| from the Gibbs parents talking about that windy road, the narrow road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| how treacherous a path it is for them to navigate to Holston Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| And I just didn't do a good job convincing you all, if that's your reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| that that road travels both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| My constituents drive that same road, that same road out to elementary school and to high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| It is a narrow, treacherous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| And, you know, I would venture to say that people that choose to live in rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| choose to understand they're going to have some narrow roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| They don't have four lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| They don't have the sidewalks, generally speaking, that you have in urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| So if you look at who is this more of an inconvenience to or a treacherous situation to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=488)|
| 0:08:17| I think that's just very short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| It's very short-sighted, and I think it's very insensitive as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| So with that said, I will be voting against these items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| Seeing no further discussion, motion is proper before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| Item number 22 is a resolution approving the budget supplement agreement number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| in the amount of $52,500 with Cannon & Cannon, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=529)|

| 0:11:02| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| The discussion goes something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| There was a good-faith effort by the Board of Education of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| and Knox County at the time, 1993, to purchase property for the building of Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=673)|
| 0:11:24| That good-faith effort of the Board of Education has come to fruition on a different piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| and this property now being surplus by Knox County has sold for more than its appraised value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| more than the purchase price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| and is leaving the Knox County rolls to go back on property tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| and be an asset to an individual in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=716)|

| 0:12:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Item number 31 is a resolution regarding the assurance of not to exceed $35 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| general obligation bonds of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| I hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| Commissioner Oidbee, is that your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=754)|
| 0:12:43| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| This resolution, along with 804, just goes along with the capital plan that was approved during the budget process in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=765)|
| 0:12:55| and it's just the issuance of those bonds for year one of the five-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| I can tell you that it includes such things as various library improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=782)|
| 0:13:15| Tennessee History Center, playground renovations, tennis and basketball court improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=795)|
| 0:13:26| building improvements across the county to county-owned facilities, 8.7 million in highway improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=806)|
| 0:13:39| Some of that is high crash data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Others are phase two and phase three of a project out, I think, in the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=821)|
| 0:13:50| I have it down at Shod, but I know that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Is it Shod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Shod Road Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Again, 19.15 million of school capital projects, of which 1.5 million each for the two new middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=836)|
| 0:14:11| The biggest piece would be 6.75 to Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| And also we're doing five years to pay off the major equipment, which is about 3.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| The big piece of that would be sheriff's vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| Chris, the school's part of that is West Haven in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=876)|
| 0:14:54| I don't see it broken out separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| Would it be in the driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| It could be in PPUs or it could be in roofs or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| What were they doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| Redoing a driveway around the school to relieve traffic off of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| I do not see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| It could be because there are drive slash parking upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| So it could be in that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Item number 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| A resolution authorizing the assurance of general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| in the accurate principal amount of not to exceed $35,900,000 in one or more series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| making provision for the assurance sale and payment of said bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| establishing the terms thereof and the disposition of proceeds therefrom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| and providing for the levy of taxes from the payment of principal, of premium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| if any, and interest on the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Let me comment that we have two items before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| One is the discussion or the delineation of the various amounts and where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=982)|
| 0:16:32| The second one is the authorizing resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| This is broken out this way to comply with the rules that govern us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| There being no further discussion of this authorizing item, which is probably before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1006)|
| 0:16:54| all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| Item number 33 is a resolution approving the amendment to the Gay Street Redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| and Urban Renewal Plan to provide for tax increment financing with the Tombris Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| Project Locate 620 and 626 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| The City of Knoxville has already approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| It looks like all we're doing here is just occupying a building that's empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| The Tombris Agency is down near Sutherland Avenue in between with a building that they own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| So if they move to Gay Street, then we've got another building down there for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1074)|
| 0:18:03| And I haven't heard about any large expansion plans for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| I remember when Jewelry Television came before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| they were talking about how they were going to expand the business, and they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| They built a huge building out there behind the one that we worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| But I haven't seen anything other than just giving these guys a gift for their taxes, which I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Are you calling on Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| I thought there were some job expansion in this move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Don Michelle Foster, Director of Redevelopment for the City of Knoxville, 400 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| This Tombris TIF that we're looking at is also in our redevelopment area that's removing a blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| and vacant property that has been sitting on the corner of Church and Gay for about 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| Mr. Tombris has talked to the city in regards to that respect that he is expanding his business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| and we are actually moving a national headquarters that is prominent in the area to the downtown area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| He's looking to expand maybe to 200 employees, and Mr. Tombris is here tonight to speak on that in that behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1160)|
| 0:19:32| The property taxes generated from that TIF over a period of time will be both city and county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| We're going from a low property value because it is vacant and blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| and we are now moving into a redevelopment to put that property back in reuse with job expansion and also job creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1183)|
| 0:19:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| I too at first had problems with this, and my problems were with relocation of about a mile and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| and turning down federal funds for the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| When I learned who the company was and what their industry is, I kind of understand the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| If you're an advertising company, you're about image and branding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| and you have to be able to, when you bring people in, have a certain level of look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1219)|
| 0:20:29| So I kind of got past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| I guess the thing that gets this over the hump for me is that building's been sitting there 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| That is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| And if that's what it takes to get creative people downtown into a building that is continuing to deteriorate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| then I guess we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| I tend to agree with Commissioner Brantley, but, you know, I felt that way about Regal as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| I mean, this is probably, in terms of job growth, more than what Regal brought, and we poured out the bank for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| So not we, but the city primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| So this, you know, I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| I do support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| It's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| I also like the fact that I think we're a little heavy on residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| So I'm glad that we're not taking away offices and businesses and jobs downtown and putting more residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| I think we're okay with residential, and there will be some more, I'm sure, with this Marble Alley project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| So that piece I definitely applaud you all on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| But, you know, I'll continue to say these are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| These are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| The building has been sitting idle since KUV left, but, you know, it's ‑‑ I just wish we were in a position to where we're not relocating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1311)|
| 0:22:05| that we're bringing in, you know, good new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| And by good, I don't mean, you know, in the teens of dollars or in the $20 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| And I'm not saying that these aren't more than that, but, you know, some really heavy‑hitting jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| So keep up the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I'm sure this thing will turn and we'll end up getting some true headquarter type big, big businesses downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1343)|
| 0:22:33| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| I guess I was kind of reading the economic information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| So what's the value of the building currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Do you have that handy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Not without looking too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| I guess I'm looking at the taxes on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| It's at $2 million right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| And currently the taxes collected is roughly 13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| Less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| And so at the end of the project you're looking at a $200,000 tax bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| Yeah, and I think what's important that that's not impacted by the city or county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| until you have the incremental taxes that you do get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Generate the taxes over that period of the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| So that's important for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| How long is the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| It's a 20‑year TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| 20‑year TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| 20‑year TIF, a very extensive project to rebuild and two buildings, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| You have the OKUB building and the building adjacent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| So some extensive improvements, public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| as well as upgrades to water, gas, and electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| What will the taxes collected be after the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| not when the TIF is complete, but when the project is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| What will the tax ‑‑ because we're still going to gain tax revenue at the end of that, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| Just at completion, not at the end of the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| I'm showing here our property tax after TIF is $105,000 for the city and $90,000 for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| We're going to increase our collections during occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| It's incremental over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Do you know what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Year‑to‑year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| No, I just have the incremental growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| Because we're going to change the assessment once he completes his construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| So we're going to have 20% of that because 80% is going to go to the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| So this is not a total loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| It's not a total loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| It's not a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Incremental growth over a 20‑year period where you're just receiving $6,000 for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| and about $5,800 for the county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| But that's going to increase as soon as he walks in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| So I think these, you know, it's easy to say we're giving somebody a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| We're not on the hook for anything, and we're going to have a tax‑increased building next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| So the city is not on the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| It's been done at the Holston successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| The Regal Cinemas has done it successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Everything downtown has paid off on these TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| And that's pretty much how you're going to get people to reinvest in these old buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| So I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| You know, my point on this, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| First of all, I think it's a home run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| To me, I mean, I've been in Tomrus Building there on Concord Street many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| They were cramped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| They already had more employees than have been in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| And they are planning on growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| And I think this is the type of people we need downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| because these people can help push the image of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| So I'm kind of excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Those are the people we need down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| As far as what Commissioner Smith was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| I never want to see the KUB building looking like it used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| It reminds me of going down there at the last minute to pay my bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| before they used to turn off my lights when I was in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| So I never want to see that building again, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| But I am excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| We're going to win in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Get to 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| It's not like it's been off the tax roll for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| It's 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| I'm ready for something to be done with this building, that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| It's going to make that whole corner look a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| So that's my opinion, and I'm definitely voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| I agree with Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| The fear of that green building and having to go down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| and pay my lights at the last minute was petrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| I think it's a win-win for us, and it gets downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| more businesses moving downtown, which is what we want and what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| This is something that's been sitting vacant for 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| and it's time that somebody is willing to step up and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| It's great for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| I hate to see you leave Sutherland Avenue, but that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I don't think there's a business anywhere in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| if you forgive their taxes for 20 years, that would not move to Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Let's just keep that in mind, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| This is a company that's operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| It's been in Knoxville for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| They're great business people, good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| But, you know, there has to be some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| We need to be bringing businesses that's going to add to our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| And, yeah, it's going to make a nice facade there on Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| but that's not the point of doing this, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| So I'm still voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Just one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Has this TIF already passed the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| It's being heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| No, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| We're going to pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| Councilor Seymour, name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| I just wanted to respond to Commissioner Brantley's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| Right now the Thomas Company has approximately 150 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| It intends to grow to over 200 in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| This is a homegrown business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| I think if you talk to the business development people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| most of your growth, employment growth in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| comes from existing long-term businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Yes, it's nice to hit a home run, bring somebody in from out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| but day in and day out when we look at job growth figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| they come from our existing businesses that want to stay in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| want to expand in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| and that's what the Thomas Group is wanting to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Thank you, Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| and thanks for the use of your umbrella when Bob and I went to get some coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| I certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| However, that's not my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| I know Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| He's a fantastic businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I've known him for 50 years almost, even during the boat racing days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| Fabulous company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| It's a wonderful advertising agency and much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| My point is that everyone in Knox County would love to move to Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| if we forgive their taxes for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Now, sometime you have to realize that why should he get something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| that someone else isn't doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Is it just because they didn't apply for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| That's a pretty good segue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I did want to point out that there are a lot more of these TIFs that come through the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| than make it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| They vet them pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| So not everybody that comes gets one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| They go through the process of their steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| and they pick out the best ones to send to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| Ed, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| I would rather see companies coming in from out of town that had no footprint in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| that were not just relocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| But, again, I think we have a building that sat there 16 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| and nobody's came in from out of town to get in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| And nobody else locally in town has wanted to go to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| Once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1811)|

| 0:30:14| 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Now, think how long 20 years is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| That's two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| Ms. Foster, Councillor Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| I appreciate your testimony that you have given us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| It's a lonely feeling, isn't it, Ed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| Oh, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| You know, Tony Thomas is one of the greatest guys in the advertising world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| My point is only everyone in Knox County would be glad to come down to Gaines Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| if you could forgive the taxes for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| I'm in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| We have one more item, but I need to look at the clock on the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| and tell you that the time is 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| This meeting will be adjourned at 545.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Item number 34 is a resolution requesting the Knox County Purchasing Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| to issue a request for proposals for a safety center in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| with the scope of work to be included in the RFP to be provided by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| This is resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| I'd like to make a motion that this be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| Well, we can do it 30 days at a time because I know we're not going to be ready in 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| but it's possible 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| I don't know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I would like to hope so, but I'll make a motion that we postpone this 30 days at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| Leave yourself open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| I have a question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Couldn't we just table it, and then we can bring it back any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Yeah, you probably need at least 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Y'all are going to meet March 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| You're probably going to need at least 60 days, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Yeah, I guess really the question is are we going to design the RFP through the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1955)|
| 0:32:45| or are we going to design it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Because really your scope of services are going to be best known once you have your vendor in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| And so what is the process that we're going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| I think it's a great thing, but I don't want to do it incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| And so the process, I guess, does it make sense to bring on some kind of consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| or a vendor ahead of time to know exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| There's not very much capacity up here for us to make decisions on how to treat mentally ill people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| We don't have that as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Now, we've got a certain group of people that want to help us do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| but we're about to allocate long-term hundreds of thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| and we just need to make sure that we're doing it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| So are we setting the RFP to find a vendor and then setting the parameters of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| or are we doing parameters of service first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| Well, as soon as we get something back to where we can come with a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2029)|
| 0:33:59| that would be made to this body, then this body would make the recommendation then to ask for the RFP for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2039)|
| 0:34:08| But we need to see what the proposal looks like and decide exactly what we want to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| And it's going to be a skeletal framework to start with because it's going to have to be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| You know, you've got to walk before we can run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| Well, I guess we'll just wait to see what the discussion is 60 days down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| I just want to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| there's no experts on this body that know how to exactly do what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| And so I think it would be wise to have your vendor in place before we set the parameters of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| It's really going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Well, we did discuss in the workshop and the committee bringing Andy Black on as a consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| Not the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| And to expand the committee to bring in some people that do have some expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| And I did ask Hugh during the workshop today if it would be best to put out a very broad scoped RFP to get our service provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2105)|
| 0:35:16| and then work through the details with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I thought in the meeting that we had earlier that was one of the reasons we were sending two representatives to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| to find out how much we had to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| And I think that's an important part issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| I think you just answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| I don't even know why I'm talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| But we need to know how much we're going to get from the state and how much we need to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2139)|
| 0:35:47| So I think the delay is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| The delay that is before us is for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| I'd like to change that to 60 if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| I just think 30 is too fast anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Well, I agree, but I'd rather leave myself an opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| If something comes up, I want to be able to jump on it if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Nothing says we can't postpone it 30 more next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| I just want to say in regards to what Commissioner Anders said a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| and he's correct that none of us up here know how to treat mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| But the idea behind this is having under one umbrella all of these services that are available in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2188)|
| 0:36:37| under one umbrella so that they can be referred to them from the safety center and work outward to these branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2197)|
| 0:36:49| But, again, as I said earlier, it's going to take the whole community working together to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| This committee as established by the chair will remain in existence for up to 11 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2215)|
| 0:37:05| The committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| The committee of commissioners working this issue will remain in place for up to 11 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2226)|
| 0:37:16| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Do we need to wait until next Monday to vote on the committee members that were suggested earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| That is the work of this committee of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| That's your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| A committee is formed by the chairman that can be added to and subtracted from by the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| So that's easily done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| I don't have to get special dispensation from the pope then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Motion is properly before us to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| Commissioner Bussler, you're going to have the last discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| But before we get to that, the development corporation will meet Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| If any member of the board of commissioners wishes me to inquire or make statement to the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| please make sure I'm informed of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| The early voting in Knox County, presidential and county primary, is currently in process through February the 23rd and March 1st is election primary day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2299)|
| 0:38:36| If anyone would like to have a brochure that has been left for us, please pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| I would also like to say that the Smoky Mountain air show is April the 15th, 16th, 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| Mayor Burchett, thank you for getting Knox County involved into the equivalent of two home games of football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2329)|
| 0:38:58| That will mean a lot of cash flow in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2338)|
| 0:39:08| Mr. Chair, just one final thing for some that weren't here for their other meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| The next meeting, the next general meeting of that safety committee will be March 14th right here, 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| Continuing on with one more announcement, immediately following this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| the arts and cultural alliance will be meeting with commission in the small assembly room at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2370)|
| 0:39:43| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Don't forget, Ed and I are going to be out in Corrington tomorrow night from 5 until 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| We're going to be at Henry's Bakery and Deli, 7231 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| Please come out and speak with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| All elected officials are welcome to join us in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| We hope to see you out there and have anything you want to discuss with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| We'll be there, 5 to 7 tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Yeah, I think Friday, I think you guys got notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I think at 11 o'clock in Gibbs and 1 o'clock in Hardin Valley, it will be groundbreaking for the middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| We'd love to have you guys out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| This is an issue that I take offense to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| It has to do with political ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| Ads come out and they say things on it, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160216?start=2438)|
