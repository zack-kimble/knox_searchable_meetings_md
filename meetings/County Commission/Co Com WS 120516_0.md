| 0:00:20| A majority of commission is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=20)|
| 0:00:22| We want to say thank you to all of you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=22)|
| 0:00:24| We're going to go through this as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=24)|
| 0:00:27| But of course, this is an opportunity for commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=27)|
| 0:00:29| to ask questions and for you to relay to us anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=29)|
| 0:00:33| that you would like about your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| First up, we have the mayor's office and Mayor Tim Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| Mayor Burchett, thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members, commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| I just want to say I'm very impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| with the executive branch of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| And I look forward to working there at least two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| Now, we have reduced the, you'll see in the budget there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| we reduced $140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| And that's primarily just the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| And it's not an actual savings, so I don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| Remember in Nashville, we used to say when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| somebody would find a savings, and they'd say, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=66)|
| 0:01:09| I know exactly where I want to spend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| Well, this isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| You don't have that option with this money, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| And that's, if anybody has any questions, I mean, I'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| Questions for the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Mayor, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| We're reading, we're seeing a lot of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| about the Sheriff's Department wanting this increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| When were you aware of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| Well, we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| The sheriff and I talked about it, I guess, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| maybe four days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=96)|
| 0:01:36| It was on Thursday, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| And then it was, of course, we'd already done the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| So in other words, while you were doing the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| they didn't come to you and try to let you work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| into your plan or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| But, you know, that's their prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| It's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| We'll address that later today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| Next, we have Foster Arnett, county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Foster, thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| We appreciate the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| And if you'll indulge me for about five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| I want to tell you about some great things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| are happening in your clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| So I'll start with my formal presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Mr. Chairman, lady, and gentlemen of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| Commission, Honorable Mayor Tim Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| ladies and gentlemen of the audience, and most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| my bosses, who are the Knox County taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| I'm delighted to report to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| that your Knox County clerk's office is stronger than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| We've been through an amazing cultural change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| And I'm proud to say that we're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| I first want to thank my senior staff, Pat Sullivan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| my chief deputy, Peggy Kane, my finance director and her staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| Jessica Reynolds, my lead office manager and her managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| and Wendy O'Neill, my administrative deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| and right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| I think together with all the employees of our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| that we're turning things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| We're on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| We're polite to our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| And we work extremely hard for the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| I'm simply a figurehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| The men and women of this office have done it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| And I strongly believe if you ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| they'll tell you that morale is high and they enjoy their jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| because we have a direction now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| And we're constantly trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| And I think that's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| So if you'll allow me just a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| to hit some of the high points this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| to back up what I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Our complaints are at an all-time low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| while our compliments are at a corresponding all-time high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Do we make mistakes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Do we admit those mistakes, correct them, and move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| By moving from the Knoxville Center Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| to our new location in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| we project to save the Knox County taxpayers over $243,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| over the next eight years of their own money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Since 2008, when I took office, our transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| are up by almost $53,000, which translates right at $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| for Knox County coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| $532,000 of that money has been in wheel tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| So that's over half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| in wheel tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Our hotel motel tax under Wendy's watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| is up to almost $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| And did you know, and this is incredible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| that last year alone, our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| completed 516,575 transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| Let me repeat that, 516,575 transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| That is absolutely phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| And the compliments go to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| Because the state of Tennessee in January of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| altered what it does in the West Knoxville office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| our driver's license transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| at offices such as Cedar Bluff, East Knoxville Downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| and Hulls have shot up over 4,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Now I want to be clear, the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| has been extremely helpful in assisting us locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| And I want to thank Commissioner Bill Givens and his staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| personally for all of their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| And I would be terribly remiss, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| want Mayor Burchett especially to listen to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| if I didn't thank County IT Director Dick Moran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| and his staff every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| And I mean every single time I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| called Dick Moran to ask if he could help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| and his staff could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| The answer has always, always been, what can we do to help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| Those guys and gals have been phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| And I appreciate Dick and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Last year, and this number is pretty small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| but we were able to cut out some vendor costs of $1,646.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| And as they say, hey, a penny saved is a penny earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| And as you know, I declined my travel allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| of over $7,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| And I refuse to drive an OX County issued car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| I've also cut the allowances for my senior staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| and have cut our auto division travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| so that this year our couriers who are out anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| can serve our auto dealers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| And we save an additional $8,000 in travel reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| We are asking you today to increase our operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| by only $15,000 from 619,914 to 631,043.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| I think if you look at our overall contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| of excess fees in OX County since 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| which total over $3 million, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| a pretty small increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| I'm hopeful our revenues will more than cover this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Since I was elected clerk, our offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| have turned over $80 million to Knox County's general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| That's $80 million that we've turned over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| to Knox County's general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| And if you add the $3 million in excess fees, even for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| that's not hard math to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| That comes out to be $83 million we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| turned over to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| We've strived every year to cut money out of our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| while stepping up our service and working hard, really hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| to serve the taxpayers of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| and to make our office the premier office in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| I truly believe we're turning this operation around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| Do we have more to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| Are we going to get it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| That's my promise to you and to the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| I have the finest staff in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| from the professionals behind each desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| to the professionals you also know so well in our commission library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| and everyone in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| And I appreciate you taking about five minutes of your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| to listen to what is going on in the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| And we're real excited and we're real happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Foster, do you have a figure as to how much of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| is done online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Because I know that you had put a push on to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| and I like your statement, don't stand in line, go online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| How has that worked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| It's worked very well, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| We don't have any specific numbers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| We're working with the IT department to kind of pull those numbers together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| But it's so new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| It's kind of like our new East Knoxville office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| We have people that literally pull up in front of the East Knoxville office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| with the big sign that says, Knox County Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| and they say, where's the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| So we're trying to get them accustomed to that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| and we're trying to get accustomed to going online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| And I'll give you a quick example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| I went to speak to Nucleus Knoxville, which, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| is the leaders under 30 years old in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| And I asked them how many people had, there was about 80 people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| and I said, how many people had any kind of interaction with our office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| And everybody held up their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| And I said, how many people came into our office and not one hand went up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| So it's the younger generation who really loves the online transactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| but it's some of the older people, like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| who like to go in and do their transactions face to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| But it's getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| It's not where we want it, but we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Mr. Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| I'm one of the older ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Yeah, well, same too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| I enjoy going into the office, and your Knoxville branch, East Knox branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| I think it was a great decision to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| And I've been in there on a couple of occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| and the staff there is just wonderful, very cheerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| And I've never seen people be so happy to come work for the government before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| But I love what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| I've loved the savings, especially, and I'd really like to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| But I just wanted to commend the people, especially at East Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| They're just wonderful people out there, and that was a smart move by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Foster, you're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| I'll look up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| You're doing a great job for Knox County, for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| How many sites do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| How often do you visit those sites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| I try to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| I haven't been, probably all of you know I had a little health scare a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| But normally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Well, I've been out over 800 times since I took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| And you don't take travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| I will take reimbursement if I go out there, but it's very nominal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| Explain this about the travel that you don't, you mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| Well, I'm allowed to take $7,000 a year for travel allowances, an elected official, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=621)|
| 0:10:29| I can have a county car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| I just think that's a waste of taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| They don't need to be paying me if I'm not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| But if I travel to halls, then I'll put my mileage down, and I get paid at the rate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| whatever it is, 50, 55.5 cents a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| But there's so many things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Like yesterday, the U.S. Department of Passports came and held a seminar here for passport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| clerks from within a 100-mile region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| And we went out and we bought refreshments at Sam's and coffee, and I didn't put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| down, and I also paid for that out of my pocket, because all that does is make Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| And the only complaint they had was that the room was too cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| But there's not much I can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| So, of the 7,000, how much will you spend a year on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| How much will you turn in a ballpark figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| You mean for my personal travel going to and from the satellite offices, I'd be surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| if it's $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| And you go how many times a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| I go 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Well, I've been in the satellite offices 800 times since I got elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| And that was what year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Foster, everybody knows that we've experienced some kind of tough times in Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=705)|
| 0:11:53| and you are certainly your office, the clerk's office, and your willingness to go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| and confront some things that needed to be done and change that culture is well known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Foster, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Next up, we have the law director, Joe Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| I received an email from Joe saying that he's in court today and that he had consulted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| Mr. Armstrong about the budget, that they both agreed on the numbers, and so we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| an opportunity to, unless there's someone here from the law director's office that wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| to address it, we'll just do that at one of our workshop meetings if you have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Next up is the property assessor, Phil Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Mr. Ballard is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| Phil, thanks for being here this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=761)|
| 0:12:51| Good morning, Mr. Hammond and the rest of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Proud to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Well, you know, sort of like Foster, he's had a lot of good things happen in his office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| and we have too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| I think I can stand here and tell you that we have the most professional and certified staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| that's ever existed in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| And, you know, what our main purpose, what we do every day is mass appraisals and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| sort of the appeal process is sort of a spinoff of that that's very important as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| And, you know, not to belabor a lot of things, I have worked closely, Mr. Weaver, with Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=802)|
| 0:13:30| Codwell, he's worked with us disunbelievably, and there's a little bit of increase in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| The reason is that we've combined digitized mapping with the property assessors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| It was a separate line item and it shows a little bit of the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| But now with reappraisal coming up, one of the things that is reflected in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| is that just the mail outs alone will be over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| But I really, like I said, we have a little bit of amendment that was able to give Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| a little bit of new numbers on the postage yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| The $35,000 increase and then on the sort of education pay supplement of $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=851)|
| 0:14:19| So other than that, the budget is very much in line with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| Questions for Mr. Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| I see none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| So you convinced us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Tell me about your travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| You travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| I travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| The first year that I came into office, it was sort of like Foster, $7,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| That had traditionally been that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| And what I did is reduce that by half to $300, which equals your all's travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=883)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you, Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Next is the Sherry Witt, Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=897)|
| 0:15:12| Sherry, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Good morning, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Thank you for giving me the opportunity for you to ask me questions about the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Once again, I'm proud to report, in some cases confirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| that the registrar's office has cut another 4.6 percent out of our operating budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| We are, as you know, affected by the real estate market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| and we are constantly trying to keep abreast of everything that is going on with the new laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| and keeping our office running and keeping it like the people of this county have expected the registrar's office to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=945)|
| 0:15:54| We did a social security redaction this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| and that was very exciting for a lot of citizens that they don't have the worry of identity theft in the registrar's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| So that was the main thing that we did, and we did that out of our DP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| And so our fees, again, were what we turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| The excess fees were about $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| So we're very proud of that in these times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| If you all have any questions, I'd be glad to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| Sherry, what were the 4.6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| What were your major cuts that you were able to save?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| What were some of the savings that you came up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| Well, we have such a small budget, Commissioner, operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| that we're just saving every way that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| We have gone back and revisited some of our contracts with copier contracts or our microfilm contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=999)|
| 0:16:50| We've reduced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Even as we go to the point that we're looking at papers and pencils and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| just where we can get by with a bare minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| What about your travel, Sherry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| How much are you taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| My travel is the same as it has been since I've been in, $700 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Thanks, Sherry, for that cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| We obviously look across the board at all departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| and when we see operating budgets that are reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| that means that you're being diligent in your leadership of that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| I know it's not a significant amount, but every little bit helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| So we try to do our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Sherry, thank you so much for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Next is the Sheriff's Department, Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| I understand he is out of town, but Allison is here to represent him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Allison, thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| You are welcome, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I'm here to answer any questions you may have on the Sheriff's Office budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| Just a quick summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| Our operational budget did increase around $550,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| That is due to the fuel budget increase, our inmate medical, and also our inmate food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| Our concern is with the closing of Lakeshore, our medical budget may not be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| Time will tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| We don't really know right now how much more we may need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| But for right now, hopefully this will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| What about the is there a proposal for a pay increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| There is a proposal for a pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| The Sheriff has asked for one step plus 3% for all the Sheriff's Office employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| But that is not reflected in the budget that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| No, not in the budget that you have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| Anything that you all would like to say about that in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| Chief Biggs is here to address the pay raise issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| I would like to say during our meetings with finance and the short-term finance director, we did discuss raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1138)|
| 0:19:08| We were told there would be no raises since we did get the 3% in January, although that did not even cover the cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1148)|
| 0:19:19| So that's why we did not put it in at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| Commissioner Wendy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Do you all have an estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Thank you for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Do you all have maybe even a ballpark of what you think the closure of Lakeshore is going to increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| And even people being arrested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| I mean, I know in 91 it went up drastically when they reduced it from 800 to 200 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| I think the same thing is going to happen come June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| Chief Bivens, who is the director over Corrections, is here this morning to answer any questions you may have concerning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| To answer that question, we really don't because there is some stuff going on with the state about transport costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| and some different things that we have not seen come to the table yet, so we're not for sure what is going to happen with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| But basically right now with Lakeshore and the whole issue with Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| we are transporting people daily, every week, two and three times a day to Chattanooga and to Johnson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| So that cost in itself is a big issue, is a big concern for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| Like I said, though, there is some talk that there is some type of a transportation-type division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| that the state is going to be looking at doing for the counties and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| so we have not got the final word on what they're going to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| As far as being able to estimate what we're going to wind up with out east in the detention facility, we really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| Currently, we have a pod dedicated to that, and it's full all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| Yeah, that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| It's been my concern all along about Lakeshore closing is that the funds aren't going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| I pray that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| So right now, those costs of our transportation, we're eating those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| We pay for that, and there's no signs of that even being reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| At the current time, we are transporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| Like I said, there was one weekend we took six to Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| and we wound up bringing four of those guys back that was denied when we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| And some of you guys, you know, they've been out to the facility, and we've discussed issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and you've seen some of those areas of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| You know, our concern is when you increase, then you have to increase services to be able to deal with those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| It's just really a big thing, and that's why I've come with Allison this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| is I'm really concerned about what's going to happen with the closing of Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| I'm glad that y'all are just as concerned as I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| and I thank the rest of the citizens that they're either going to end up on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| or they're going to end up in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| And I worry about the funding and the housing, especially out in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Well, you know, and as me and the sheriff have said before, and the commission has talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| it's just not the place for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| They're not going to get the help that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Not that y'all don't take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| It's just y'all are not doctors and don't need to be administering drugs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| But I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Hey, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| If you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Can you, when did we start going to Chattanooga and Johnson City, just when Erie Lakeshore talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| We've been going approximately about the last six to seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| So that started long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| And we've been kind of dwindling down since they got the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| So we've been kind of, that's kind of picked up since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Can you, if you can, can you e-mail us the amount of trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| and what you estimate the cost at so we can get with our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| and try to make sure that we're being compensated in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Would you like to address us on the pay raise issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| We want to give you the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| I'm Eddie Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| I'm the Chief Deputy Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| And a few things I'd like to cover with you quickly is the disparaging in the pay for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1384)|
| 0:23:14| May I hand this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| Jolie, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Jolie will hand them out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1398)|
| 0:23:28| Just to give you a little background, in my prior employment I was all over East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| and virtually every law enforcement agency in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| The Knox County Sheriff's Office is one of the most professional organizations I've been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| I've been here now seven months, and I've seen a lot of good work provided by the deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| As of items that we're handing out here, the main issue that I'd like to address with you is our retention issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| We've spent $100,000 to train someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| and after they're trained, in a short time, one of these smaller agencies scoops them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| pays them more money, gives them better benefits, and we lose that $100,000 investment each time that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| I don't have specific numbers on that right now, but I do know of individual cases where that has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| If you've got a moment to look over the article I just gave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| you will notice that the corrections office, according to this resource document that came from Chattanooga, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| shows that we're 34% behind on pay for the corrections office and 19% behind on our deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| We need additional pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| The small amount that they received would need to cover cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| We don't have the built-in cost of living as the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| So we need additional monies to try to put food on these people's tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| These are people that spend 24-7, 365 to protect this community, and I think we owe it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| And if you've got any questions for me, I'd be glad to try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| I'm for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| You all do great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| My concern is we've been talking about this budget for months and months and months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| and at the last minute you all seem to come in and say, hey, we want some more money on top of this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Why weren't you at the table trying to work with the mayor early on so we could try to work this in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| like we're trying to work with the school budget and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| That's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| It's like it's a half-hearted attempt on your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Oh, by the way, we'd like this for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| That's certainly not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| We had conversations early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| and we were told repeatedly that there would not be any pay increases by the powers that be at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| We're here asking you as a body that provides that documentation to make that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| and explain to you some of the issues we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| We're trying to do something to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| We can't bring up 19% at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| We can't provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| So a step increase and a 3% raise, I think, is something that needs to occur to get the ball rolling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| to get something done to bring them up to the averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| But when you were told, no, that you weren't going to get this, you know, we're still coming to the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| You've known for months that you weren't going to get this, that the mayor did not want to put it in his budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| and we're just now hearing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Well, Mr. Smith, I would say that you all are the final judgment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| Yes, we are the final judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| But, you know, we need time to study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| We put a lot of time on the school issue, and we'd love to put a lot of time on your issue, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| But coming to the last minute, it makes it hard on us to, you know, see what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| But I'm not here to argue for or against the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| What I'm telling you is we've got a situation where our deputies are in need now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Their families are not being fed properly because of some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| And it's different for a $150,000-a-year employee to sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| and make judgments about things all over this building when you've got people making $28,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| that has difficulty feeding four children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| That's what it really comes down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| But on the other side, Mr. Briggs, they know that coming in, just like a school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| A school teacher knows what they make coming in, and a police officer knows what they make coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| And if that's not going to suffice their family, then they might try another profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| I mean, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| But they come into it with their eyes wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| But, on the other hand, when you come into a job in 2008 and you begin at a beginning salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| and four years later you haven't had any increase on your step to raise that salary up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| so the new guy comes in in 2012 is making precisely what you made when you came in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| That's just not equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Let me ask this question, too, with regards to you said you're looking for a step increase and a salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| So, what translated, what exactly does that mean to the officer on the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| Basically, what it would come to would give the people that did start in 2008 an additional step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| to where that stays with them the entirety of their career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| The 3% is a one-time situation, as you know from the past experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| And it would equate to about $2.9 million if we did both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| If you did just the 3% without the step or the step without the 3%, what would the numbers be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| I have to put my eyes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| I can't see well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| Oh, it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| It's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| We have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| We have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| I just haven't had a chance to look at the document yet, but it's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Commissioner Andrews was showing me those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| So I can get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| Or Commissioner Breaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| I was going to ask the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| What is the total with the step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| It would be roughly $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| I'm for trying to find a way to get the step and get the regular 3% for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1715)|
| 0:28:47| I mean, we've been going over how to find money for the school system to do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| And I would like to also see the raises for the custodians and everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1735)|
| 0:29:04| That's another budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| But still, every year we go through this, and we keep forgetting about the people that are doing the real job out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1745)|
| 0:29:15| the ones that are doing the real work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| And we want these increases for all these different programs or bonus programs and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| But we forget about the patrolmen and the correction facility workers out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| the staff you have out there that has had one raise in, what, eight years or five years, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| So I'm for trying to find this, especially if we're talking about raising property taxes to help fund the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1776)|
| 0:29:46| Then it's not just 35 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| We need to think about a 50 cent to cover raises for other patrolmen and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| So it's not a 35 cent increase we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| We're looking at more than that, or I am at least, to try to fund these raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| Because it is pretty bad, and I know a lot of patrolmen out there that are on food stamps and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| because they can't afford to put food on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| And they do risk their lives, so we need to find a way to try to fund this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| Yeah, we can't give you 19 percent right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| I mean, I'd love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| But it's a shame that over the years that we've continued to ignore the raises every single year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| and put them off and put them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| So I am for trying to work out something and see what we can work out over the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| So thank you for your service and everybody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| We appreciate y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you for listening to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| There's Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| This is the same document that we had last year when we tried to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| when we tried to get raises for all the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| And so this information has been out here for a good long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| So I appreciate what y'all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| And this has been an issue for the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| So I feel like this information has been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| We've known that we're lagging behind on these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| This is not something new that's just coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| And I feel really strongly that, you know, everybody who works for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| deserves to make market rate for the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| And your department's not the only one that's behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| I think our restaurant inspectors and the general county employees are severely underpaid as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| So I think that, you know, every group that works for every employee that works for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1904)|
| 0:31:53| needs to receive some kind of increase in their compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| They all are out there doing the real job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| I appreciate as much as everyone, or I think maybe in some cases more than some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1921)|
| 0:32:10| about now that I'm in government and see the kind of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| and the amount of work that all our employees do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| I think it's disgraceful that we have people working in public service through the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1937)|
| 0:32:26| We have school teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| We have people who work in the different departments in the county whose children are on the free and reduced meal plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| These are full-time employees, not part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| These are full-time employees whose children are on the free and reduced meal plan at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| or who qualify for food stamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| So I think that we're doing something wrong as leaders of this government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| when we are not paying our most important employees a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| So this is something I'm very concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| I've been concerned about it for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| and I will continue to work hard to see that we do right by our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| because I think that what we're doing now, I think we have really shirked our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| to the people who work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| And I certainly don't agree with the assessment that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| someone who wants to go into public service as a career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| should not have to expect to live their life in poverty because they want to serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2003)|
| 0:33:32| So this is something that I will continue to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| You have my word on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| We certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Many of our officers work extra jobs just to try to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| Mr. Smith's statement about they knew what they came in with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| they didn't know they was going to be stuck five years later without any increase in what they came with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| That doesn't happen in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Most people receive raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| And I don't think, Mr. Smith, I can't speak for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| but if you started your career making $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| you wouldn't want to stay there for the rest of your career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Eddie, I'm unemployed every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| I start at zero every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| I just wanted to wrap up and say, you know, I'm with the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| I want to do what we can for you, but not just for your group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| I may personally, I don't want to give this group a raise and not these other people over here a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| I think we're going to give a raise that needs to be across the board for all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| That's what's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| We don't need to line up all the sheriff's people in the back when it comes time to vote and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| give us our raise, give us our raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| and the other office holders, they don't bring their employees down here, you know, and try to influence this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| I just, you know, let's work together if we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| But I personally want to do it if we can do it across the board for everybody, not just individual groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| But we'll do what we can, and you're all doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Next, we have our trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Oh, I'm sorry, Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| I'm sorry, may I say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Commissioner Smith, in reference to the last-minute budget request on the pay raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| do you receive a copy of our requested budget, or do you just see the recommended budget from the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| From the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Okay, because every year for the past years, we have put in for a pay raise for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| The last year we received one was July 1, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| and our belief was if we put it in this year, it's going to be cut by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| He's already said he's not going to give pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| So that's why we thought we were here today, to ask you all to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| and possibly try to give our employees a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| So that's why we waited until now, because you have the final say-so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Mr. Duncan is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Mr. Duncan, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| and I'd like to thank the entire commission for the chance to update you all about our budget here this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| We've had a very successful year in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| As you know, our primary functions are to collect the county's property taxes and to invest the county's funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| As shown in the monthly reports we issue to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| this past year saw the highest property tax collection total in Knox County's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| Through the end of April, we totaled more than $246 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| We've already beaten last year by $4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| and that's still with two months remaining in the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| And as you all know and we've talked about before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| after I took office I made a series of changes to how we collect delinquent taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Those changes are paying off, I'm pleased to report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| and delinquent collections have seen an increase of over 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| Early on, a lot of attention was given to our decision to make the delinquent tax attorney's position an in-house position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| I know Commissioner McKenzie asked at one point if we could provide the commission with numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| comparing the way the system works now to the way it did in prior years under previous arrangements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| and we prepare those reports and we'll start issuing those in our monthly reports as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| But those numbers include that our attorney has already produced 358,315 additional fees for the county this year alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2245)|
| 0:37:36| 422,000 for the courts, and over half a million dollars which has gone to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| So if we had continued under the county's prior arrangement with an outside law firm doing the collections work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| that firm this year would have received over $522,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| and that's still, as we said, with a little time to go in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| But our investments, I'm also pleased to report, have been equally as successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| By aggressively seeking new bond opportunities, we've increased investment income by over 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| and that's despite a very challenging interest rate environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| But I hope we can maintain and even improve on this level of success in the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| and we'll try our best to continue to get these kind of results at the lowest cost possible to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| So our requested budget for 2013 is $770,307.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| This reflects an 11 percent reduction in spending from the previous year, which we project will end up at $861,442.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2308)|
| 0:38:38| Now, it should be noted that this year for the first time in history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| the trustee's office has included every single cent it spends in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| In the past, the office would use the fee in operating account to pay for direct costs associated with collecting property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| And so these costs are things like legal fees for title work and publication costs to include legal notices in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2334)|
| 0:39:04| So most of these costs are eventually recouped by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| So the number in our budget is actually much higher than what the true cost will eventually be to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| after we get these costs back from either delinquent taxpayers or buyers of new properties in tax sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| But at the same time, I felt like it was extremely important that we put these numbers on budget this year to be as transparent as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2362)|
| 0:39:31| and to show the taxpayers exactly how every dollar of their money is spent and exactly where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| And we don't have to talk about the issues in the past that this fee in operating account has generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2377)|
| 0:39:47| But the savings this year are primarily going to be made by cuts in travel and to legal and professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| Last year, I made the decision to discontinue the practice of paying auto allowances in the trustee's office in favor of a mileage reimbursement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2394)|
| 0:40:03| We now have numbers that will show that change that resulted in reductions of travel costs of over 30 percent for the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| And we expect those savings to be even more this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| We've also saved a substantial amount of money by using seasonal employees to staff many of the satellite offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| rather paying for the offices to stay open on a year-round basis when they're simply not being used on the trustee's side during the non-collection periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| So even though it costs far less now than it did, the satellite offices this past year have brought in just as much money and just as many transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2429)|
| 0:40:40| And I'd also like to point out that our payroll budget this year is $150,000 less than the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| We continue to operate with far fewer employees than our predecessors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| While the office had as many as 59 at one point in the past, we have 37 full-time employees now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| And we're projecting that we'll be able to turn over nearly $4.8 million to the general fund in excess fees at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| But I'd be happy to answer any questions you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Mr. Duncan, I saw your report, and it was like on property tax collections $7 million ahead of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| So a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I know Mr. Ballard's office is assisting in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| So I think the public needs to know that we are $7 million ahead of last year on property tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| And I think it was like $14 million ahead on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| So, I mean, that obviously is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| Any questions for Mr. Duncan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| You know, I also want to point out on the collection totals, and I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't thank the staff in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| A lot of people have worked extremely hard to get these kind of results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| And I'm really pleased with the people that we have working hard for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| It looks like there are no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| So thank you very much for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Next, we have Lynn Littington with Air Quality Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Good morning, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| I want to start out by telling you that your air quality is better than it's ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| And one of the reasons I stress that is because you may have read in the paper a week or so ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| that we're being named as a nonattainment county again for ozone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| The reason for that, out of 18 ozone monitors in this East Tennessee area, one monitor is in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2541)|
| 0:42:31| That monitor is located at Look Rock in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| It's a high elevation monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| The other 17 monitors are all showing compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| This is very frustrating for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| We've taken this to EPA to the highest level possible without any success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| What they basically have done is they've come up with this plan because they have to point the finger at somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2571)|
| 0:43:00| Someone's causing the air quality up at that location to just barely miss attaining the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2580)|
| 0:43:10| So their response was to name all of Blount County and all of Knox County as contributors to that monitor up in the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2590)|
| 0:43:21| When pressed further, the statement was we're the highest population center here in Knox County in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| and we have the most traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| We have three major interstates running through this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| Interstate laws do not allow us to touch those vehicles that are just traveling through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2618)|
| 0:43:46| So we're penalized for this, but just keep in mind what I first said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Our air quality is better than it's ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| So we continue to work hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| There are no requirements that come with that nonattainment designation that Knox County must do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| We just need to maintain the status quo of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| Now, moving on to the budget very quickly, we operate primarily on a continuing federal grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| That grant requires a maintenance of effort from Knox County of at least as much contribution as there was the year before, not less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2655)|
| 0:44:26| We're making that do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Our federal funds are stagnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| We don't see that they're going to be going up any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| Recession has hit our industries very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| It's causing some to close down and lay off their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| This is not the way that I want to reduce air emissions by our industry going out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2682)|
| 0:44:50| But since our permit fees are based on those air emissions, the better we do our job in reducing emissions, the less revenue we receive in permit fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2690)|
| 0:45:01| Our staff, as far as the training, this is very technical training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| It's not done here in the state except on a rare occasion when we can bring together the other four local programs in the state of Tennessee to do a training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2706)|
| 0:45:18| Most of the time we're traveling to other cities and other states for this type of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| All that said, we're not asking for anything more from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| We're dealing with less funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| We're making it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| That's my job is to make it work and, in return, make sure that our citizens are breathing clean air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2733)|
| 0:45:42| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Thank you, Lynn, for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| A question about the mulch fire and what your involvement has, what we've learned from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2747)|
| 0:45:54| what we might be involved in forward just while we have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| It's basically a city issue as far as the location of that mulch facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2760)|
| 0:46:10| My opinion would be that mulch facilities need to be away from the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| If you're going to be doing something like that, zoning needs to keep it from locating in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2776)|
| 0:46:27| We are looking at the enforcement on it right now, not from an open burning standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| but from the fact that those emissions caused us three days of poor air quality, and we're working on that as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2793)|
| 0:46:44| We'll be continuing to work with the gentleman that owns the company, trying to get him to keep those piles down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| keep them properly turned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| Unfortunately, the state of Tennessee a few years ago exempted mulch facilities from their regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| So, you know, possibly we may try for something just through Knox County to try to put some controls on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2822)|
| 0:47:11| Okay. Do you meet with the city folks on this particular issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| I have not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| I have offered our services but have not been taken up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| But I probably will push that issue as we continue on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Who is the person on the city side that corresponds to your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| We do have a member on our air board that is from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| and I'll be talking with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| He is actually over David Brace with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| And those are the individuals that, you know, I want to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| and just make sure going forward we don't have anything like this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| Well, it's one of those issues that this division between the city and the county seems rather odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| And so wherever we could push, I think it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2880)|
| 0:48:07| I know the city people are at least dismayed about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| and they're trying to work to see that this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| So I'd like to see us help in any way we could, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| If not, thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Grant Rosenberg, Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| He's in Italy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Oh, he is in Italy. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| Mr. Ben Charvel, who is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Ben, if you would also address the defined services contract as you're addressing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| and how that changed this year, or would you rather wait for Grant to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| He had called me and said he was going to be away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Would you rather we wait, I'll do whatever you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| because we can have him come to our workshop or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| Right. Grant would be better, but I can also defer to Chris and Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| The front end of the process was actually conducted in purchasing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Okay, yes, if you wouldn't mind, let's go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| and address the fact that we have gone more to defined services contracts this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| Yes, the mayor decided this year that we were going to provide a little more structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| to the award of these defined services contracts, and the county issued an RFI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2958)|
| 0:49:26| Those submittals were reviewed by panels of subject matter experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| and recommendations were made to the mayor and the mayor's staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| and they took those recommendations and the budgets you have before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| include those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| I'll defer to Chris for the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| What we basically did is we took the request that we got from the RFI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=2988)|
| 0:50:06| and we funded those at 95%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| What we'll do, Ben, is at our workshop or at another time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| we'll give Grant the opportunity to speak to us on this if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| Or if you're prepared to talk now, we'd love to hear from you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Well, I think we should probably wait for Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| I mean, I can talk about the back end of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| but that's really not going to change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| It's the front end that was purchasing and then the funding, which is Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| We'll set aside some time then at our subsequent meetings to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Dwight Vandivade, Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| And, Dwight, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| I think what you'll see as you review our budget is that the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| priorities for Engineering and Public Works are consistent with what would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| commission's priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Obviously, there is an emphasis on resurfacing roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| which is an area where we had fallen significantly behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| We have made great strides in the current fiscal year, and we are on track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| if this budget is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| to resurface a minimum of 27 linear miles of road for the next fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| assuming that the asphalt price index doesn't vary too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| and we don't at this point anticipate that it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| This budget also provides, in terms of things that might be important to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| what might sound like a relatively small item in our capital plan is a new paver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| And frequently, virtually every member of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| except, of course, first and second district commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| will call us for small repair and resurfacing jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| The paver that we utilize right now is a late 1990s model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| and it reminds me a little bit of my weed eater at home because we worked with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| for about 15 minutes, and we service it for an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| And we work with it 15 minutes and service it for an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| And it has really frustrated us, and I know it's frustrated all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| when you've called us for these small service jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| but they matter to your constituents and they matter to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| There is in the budget funds for a new paver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| and that will increase our response time and our effectiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| particularly on these small jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| Some items that I think that might be of interest to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| in particular in solid waste, with the sale of the Solway Mulch Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| we were really able to concentrate on our core mission in solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| which is the eight convenience centers across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| We own six of those, and then the two that we do not own are the two most underperforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| There are capital funds to move forward with the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| and eventual construction of a new Carn Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| And then the five-year capital plan, if you look a few years out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| also includes funds allocated for the construction of a new Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| relocation and construction of a new Carter Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| Both of those are sites that suffer from traffic and size issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| Frankly, they're too small and they don't run very efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| But we're very, very pleased with where we are with solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| and concentrating on those convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| I know they sort of fly below the radar screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| but other than Knox County Schools, as best as we can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| those eight convenience centers individually touch more of your constituents every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| than any other service of Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| We estimate, based on tube counts, between 8,000 and 9,000 visits a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| A lot of folks, a lot of your constituents use those convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| so it's important that they're clean, that they're well run, that they're organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| and that people leave feeling like they've been well attended to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| And they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| We've had a really good year this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Looking forward to a really good year next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Well, the Hemond family is one of those that uses them, too, because the John Sevier one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| I know where I was out there Saturday and there was a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| So you all do a good job, and it's great that we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Yes, the McKenzie family splits their time between Forks of the River and the Carter Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| So even though I'm a city resident, I do use those facilities, and that is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| Also, it's a good idea to stay current with these pavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| Like you say, I'm sure to contract these small jobs out will be, you know, an exorbitant amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| So it's good that we're getting those skills in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| But I guess we didn't, I don't think we brought the, you know, the million-dollar elephant into your conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3278)|
| 0:54:46| So we're going to spend, just talk a little bit about this $6 million Parkside Drive capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3286)|
| 0:54:55| Parkside Drive has been a difficult project for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| It was identified years and years ago, and we work off of crash data as we select these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| And Parkside Drive, first and foremost, was the highest crash data location that we had in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3306)|
| 0:55:14| The project got underway, was partially completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| and then it stalled out, quite frankly, due to right-of-way issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| And apparently it was going to, we got to a situation, to be perfectly blunt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| where condemnation was going to be our only option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| The past administration didn't feel condemnation was appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| so the project stopped and we have a portion of Parkside that is still a two-lane section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| In order to further abate the crash data, because it was still significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| we made individual intersection improvements at Hayfield Drive and one other intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| But the good news from our standpoint, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| and this one has been on the books for a long time and it needs to be finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| is that we think we're going to be able to acquire the balance of the right-of-way from the remaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| I think there's three property owners that we have to acquire from without condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| But Parkside Drive, for a variety of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| but public safety and crash data being the single most overriding concern, needs to be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| And with a little luck, we will be working on it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| Yeah, I definitely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| But I like to put it in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Are we talking about is this the highest crash rate in the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| Is this the highest crash rate in the southeast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Or are we talking about a relatively small number compared to, say, national data, statewide data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| Because $6 million is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| When we just got through talking about not being able to give, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| the folks that work extremely hard every day half of this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| And we're talking about, in two years, $9 million being spent in a half-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| or a mile radius, probably a half-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| You know, we talk about tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| I hear a lot of tough times, tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| But we're going to have this outlay in one year when we're not going to do a lot of things that people are asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| And we talk about the janitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| You know, what about that family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| Have we really weighed all the options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| And I'm going to give you a chance to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| And I'll go back to my original question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Where does these numbers come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| And you remember last year I asked you all, what's your priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| What are we talking about in terms of where capital outlays are going to happen over the next five to six to seven to nine years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3455)|
| 0:57:46| and why these projects are where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| So if you could talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| I wish I could give you a statewide or national context, but to be perfectly blunt about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| we look at these things strictly in a county context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Other than those that are being considered through the TPO where we are competing for regional dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| when we're dealing with local dollars, Commissioner, I focus only on that which is happening within Knox County's borders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| When Parkside Drive initially made the cut to be done, it was the number one highest crash location in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| It had more accidents than any other stretch of road in Knox County, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| Whether or not that's still the case, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| We'd have to check updated data because we have made some improvements at those two intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| and that has, I think, abated some of the rear-end collisions that we were seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| and some of those left-hand turning movements on the two-lane stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| Some of that may be improved, but it's still got crash data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| And that's still with local dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| That is absolutely how we prioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| One of the things that you'll see in the coming months is proposal for a roundabout at the intersection of North Shore Drive and Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3527)|
| 0:58:55| That is driven exclusively by crash data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| It's driven by the fact that we're seeing more accidents, particularly more injury accidents, at that location than we are anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| And so with local dollars, that's our frame of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| It just depends on where accidents happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| They're big dollars on Parkside Drive, no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| That's driven by the fact, in part, that land costs are extremely high out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| They just are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Traffic volumes are high, land costs are high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| and this is a project that's sort of stalled out at maybe two-thirds of the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| And I'd strongly encourage you to consider funding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| Let us move it forward to completion because I think it'll help from a traffic safety standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| It'll help from a traffic management standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| All the reasons that Parkside Drive was a good project years ago when it started are still prevalent today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| The numbers may have changed a little bit over time, but the core need for it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| Well, it's like you're strongly encouraging me to support this, but you're not giving me any data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| You're not giving me any background why this can't be spread out over a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| You know, you're just saying this is our idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| We want you to close your eyes and fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| We're going to look at it in our ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| I don't know whether it's four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| You know, like you say, you talk about it was the number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| It's probably not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| There may be a road out there in the halls that's just, you know, really hurting our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| a road out in, you know, deep south knots or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| I'm not, you know, wherever that's really hurting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| If I have nothing to compare this to, we've done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| We've done a heck of a lot, and I'm sure more needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| But when you're talking about $6 million in one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| followed by, you know, previous $2.8 million in one year in one section, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| we're going to make that section perfect before we move to these other areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Are there other areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| You're just giving us one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| We want you to do this this year, but we don't want you to think about it in the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| or even what that number means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| Was it four last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Is that a hard number to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| If you all come in and ask me for $6 million, how many wrecks occurred at this stretch of interstate last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3671)|
| 1:01:19| I don't think that's a hard question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| I don't think that's unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| I don't think it's, you know, section of the county baiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| It has nothing to do with area, okay, and I don't want to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| That's not where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| $6 million from this extremely conservative administration is a heck of a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| and all I'm asking is where does it stack up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| Where does this project stack up in terms of safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| What does this project stack up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| How much of this $6 million are going for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| How many acres of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| I understand property is expensive, but if this is number five now, with all the improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| this is number five, $6 million is ridiculous to give, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| I really would rather not try to offer on-the-cuff crash data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| but I'd be glad to provide you with both current crash data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| and will try to provide you with a crash data snapshot of what we had at the time that the project was initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| And I think due diligence would require me, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| to point out this project was initiated under the prior administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| and it may have even been on the books or under consideration going back to Mr. Shumpert's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| I would say it is not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| It has been on the books for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| These are big, complicated projects, and obviously they don't move quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| So crash data, I'd be glad to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I'll do my best to give you a good snapshot of what it looked like at the time that the project was initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| and what it looks like now, and then we can carry the discussion on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| During Mayor Shumpert's or County Executive Shumpert's administration, it was a two-lane rural road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| Okay, we're not there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| We've made a significant investment, and it's benefited us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| Again, are we trying to get from a comfort rating of 70 to 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| Hey, okay, we're talking about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| But if we're talking about a comfort rating from 92% to 98%, that, you know, that may not be the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3794)|
| 1:03:23| Again, you know, this just seems like a lot of money for an area that seems to be in fairly good shape compared to where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3803)|
| 1:03:36| Like you say, this is a phase, and maybe we can do phase five or six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| over a two-year period or a three-year period as opposed to putting it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| So it would be great to get that recent data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| and if you could do some kind of comparison on how it compares with other parts of the county, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3830)|
| 1:03:58| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Thanks, Dwight, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| I had some questions as regards stormwater issues, stormwater budget, just in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| I haven't looked at that aspect of your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| So could you speak to that in reference to increasing, ratcheting up requirements from the feds, et cetera, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| How are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| Budgetarily, I think we're in good shape in stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| And if you have any questions of Chris, he's here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| I'd actually like to take a moment to, frankly, brag on stormwater a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| In the tenure I've had at Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| I'm probably prouder of the improvements we've made there than I am in any other department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| Chris has been working with a lot of new staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| Quite frankly, we have made some organizational and staffing changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| and we have simply increased the overall professionalism of the inspection staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| which is a critical piece that was missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| That early generation of inspectors have largely been replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| They've been replaced with degreed and, in some cases, degreed and very experienced folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3907)|
| 1:05:16| He has new supervision over the inspection staff, and that supervisor is a young man named Heath Hahn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| who is standardizing inspection processes, requiring all inspections to be appended with photographs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| increasing the quality of documentation, standardizing things across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| It is really the answer to, more than money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| it is really the answer to some of the challenges that we've had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| They have had an exceptionally good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| When the pace of development picks up, our processes are going to be reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| They're going to be robust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| I think they're probably going to be a bit unpopular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| as people become accustomed to new and more rigorous standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| particularly the 24-hour capture requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| and some of those new federal requirements that you've alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| Budgetarily, we're in good shape, but that doesn't really tell the tale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| It's the quality of work that the staff is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| and it's the quality of staff that's in place that is going to make the difference for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| I just couldn't be more pleased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| and I think probably of the seven departments in engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| it's the one where I feel like we've made the greatest strides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| and I am really, really proud of the work that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| Right. I'd like to commend you and Mr. Grandjou also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| I think they are doing a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| and the professionalism of the staff is quite a bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| I noticed the atmosphere just being around the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| and being on the stormwater review ordinance committee and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| I do. I commend you and Mr. Grandjou for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| What do you foresee in the near future as far as pressure on that staff from the development side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4018)|
| 1:07:08| Do you anticipate anything extraordinary on the horizon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| I mean, I don't have any sense of what's going on on the development side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| although I'm very aware and very conscious of its effect on our water quality issues in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4040)|
| 1:07:29| We've certainly had our moments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| and one of the things that people will do when we take regulatory action is they call you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| they call the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| and I would want to say in both instances when that has happened, we've been given good support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| What we will do is try to have a good, solid, reliable record that we can point to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| so that when somebody calls and complains that we are imposing onerous regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| or that we're being arbitrary or unfair, you'll be able to see exactly what we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| exactly why we've done it, and what the prevailing rule of law is that we're enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| And I'm always quick to point out to folks in the development community when we have an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| that the plans they bring us are their plans, their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| And so when they come out of the plans review process and they're approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| we all agree that this is what is to be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| And so when you get out in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| our expectation is that that's what you're going to build because, after all, these are your plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| So if it becomes expensive or if it becomes inconvenient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| we're past the point of ad hoc plan revisions and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| These are your plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| They've been through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| They're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| It's incumbent on you to construct it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| It's incumbent on me to make sure that it's inspected and signed off on properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| The pace of development is slow enough that we haven't had a whole lot of difficult situations of that kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| I suspect we'll still have a few, but I think once people realize the new model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| and they understand the level of oversight that they're under and that we're under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| because we are the regulators and we are regulated by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| we're not the last stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| So as people realize that the level of regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| and the level of scrutiny that we are all under is predictable, it's reliable, and it isn't going to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4157)|
| 1:09:26| then hopefully we'll have a pretty good understanding with everybody as we go in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| Thank you, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Dwight, I know that you're the point on a lot of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| You receive a lot of pressure from both sides, and so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| It's a cultural change in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| We're in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| You're helping us get there, and it's a process to get these guys who used to do it the old way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4189)|
| 1:09:57| Those old ways are not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| And, of course, the residents of Knox County, this is very important quality of life issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| It's everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Everybody's in agreement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| So in whatever way we can help you, of course, I certainly will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Yeah, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| I just want to thank your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| I use the solid waste facility out on Dutchtown, and it is always busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| but they're always very courteous out there and have been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| And I agree that we do need a new paver to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| And your staff has always, when I've called them over any issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| has always been very prompt as far as getting out there and looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| And I thank you for your help on a couple of issues out on Lines View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| Yeah, I think it's Lines View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| As far as this Parkside, I travel that road quite a bit, and I see a lot of crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| and I see how heavy that traffic is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| And to go from four lanes down to two, back to four lanes, this has needed to be done for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| And I'm trying to look up studies now to see if there's been any other studies since that in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| But I know I see a wreck at least every single time I drive down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| and I drive down there at least three or four times a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| because that's where I take my car for service down there at Ted Russell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| which is the exact spot we're talking about that is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| And it is so hard getting in and out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| and that's where a lot of these wrecks happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| But I think that is something, and an investment of $6 million, it would be an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4308)|
| 1:11:57| When you think about the crashes that you would save, the safety reasons and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| that is what government is supposed to do is take care of our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| And if we have a need for this, this is something that we need to do, then I'm wholeheartedly behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| I think it is a wise spin, a good use of our $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| So thank you all for your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| Let me get the mic over here where I can hear myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| As far as the Parkside Drive issue is concerned, I think you've got to kind of look at that as we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4352)|
| 1:12:40| when you're traveling down the interstate and you see a road under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| If you designate a third of the money to start the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| and then all you've got are orange cones and little flashing lights there for the next umpteen years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| until you get through it, certainly it's going to cause some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| If we're at a point right now where this can finish it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| I don't see that it can do anything but help us in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| The other thing that I wanted to bring up, and I've spoken to Roy Braden about it a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| is investigate how we can get a better correlation between John Q. Developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| John Q. Public, who comes in and says, I want a grading permit, regardless of what kind of property it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| That information doesn't get sent over to codes so that there needs to be a follow-up somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4407)|
| 1:13:38| I know your grading people are following up, but I don't think we're working as closely as we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| What I would like to see, and I think is important for everybody in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| is the fact that if I come in to get a grading permit, I must have some proposed in use for that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4430)|
| 1:13:59| Not just say, I'm going to go right here and clear this lot off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| Then I come back a year later and say, well, this is all cleared off now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| I'd like to get it zone commercial and put my office in here in my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| We've had that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| It's easier to get forgiveness than it is permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| If there's a way that we can work together to say, okay, number one, Mr. Public, developer, whatever, who's doing this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4457)|
| 1:14:26| we want to know what you're going to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| and that's going to have to be approved by people down the line who would approve what you're going to do with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| before you're going to get your grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| Then we're going to be following up on both ends so that everybody works together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| and keep ourselves out of some of these problems that develop by greedy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| I mean, that's just the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| We are hard at work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Commissioner, really two parts to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Roy has been redefining and redeveloping, I guess, the small lot grading permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| and doing that in cooperation with the pledge review folks back in Stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| and on the Baxter Avenue side to see if we can't pull those pieces together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| That small lot grading actually causes us a fair amount of headache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| It probably causes a lot of you a fair amount of headache when somebody comes out to build a freestanding garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| or something like that and they don't have any kind of erosion control sediment prevention in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| They flood their neighbor and it gets to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| I think we're making pretty good progress there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| The issue of land clearing is a big and complicated one, and we've been talking about it for a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| If somebody has a piece of property that is agriculturally zoned typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| or maybe even light residential, something like that, and they're going to log it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| that's regarded as an agricultural process and I have no authority to regulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| And what happens is that property gets logged, it gets clear cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| and enough earth-moving equipment is brought out to get the timber off-site, get the brush off-site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| and then they come in and rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| And that gets people out from under buffering requirements and a whole host of things that would apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| if they went through the normal regulatory process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| And so we have been having a lot of conversations with David Vandegrift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| the University of Tennessee's forestry representative at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| and we've actually been attending the city's tree board meeting to get a feel for how they handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| And they actually have some of the same issues that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| So hopefully at some point this year we'll have some things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| Dwight, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Next we have Chris Caldwell, Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| Chris, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| My pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| I'd like to address some things before I get to the Finance Department piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| And it's just so we don't get kind of confused in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| As far as Commissioner McKenzie goes, talking about the $6 million for parkside drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| and then talking about $3 million for raises, that's bonded debt versus operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| And we don't need to try to confuse those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| Because if we do, we don't want to bond debt for raises, so we don't need to get those two confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| And from the standpoint also of doing the $6 million up front in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| it's just from the standpoint from the finance standpoint of doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| and bond it all up front instead of bonding it over a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Because if the project gets going well, then we don't want to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| We want to keep it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| And so that's why we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| And also I'd like to address the raise issue with either the Sheriff's Department or all county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| As you all talk about raises for employees, just know that a step for county employees is about, I think, 2.5% or 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4671)|
| 1:18:00| And so when you talk about a step raise, it's about $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| And each additional percent is about $1 million a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| And so when you talk about those things, just know that this budget is balanced without those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| And so if you're talking about doing a raise, it has to come from reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| It has to come from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| And so just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| Going on and with respect to all the other departments here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| I would say that the finance department is the best department in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| I may go over too well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| Basically, our budget is pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| We're $9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| I see the look from Joe Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| We're $9,000 less than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| So it's pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| And that does include the raise that was enacted in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| So if you have any type of questions, I'll be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| I'm going to get to the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| With regards to any pay raises for employees, with regards to the retirement program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| the employee would be paying, what, 6% of any raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| And then the county would be matching 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| How would those figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| That's excluding sheriff because the UOP is going to a 17% match this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| So any raise is 17% for them on retirement as far as the county is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| But for general county employees, it is mainly 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| We do have some employees that take advantage of the 8%, 10%, and 12% match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| but I think it's less than, like, 25%, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| So, basically, but that million-dollar figure includes benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| So it's salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Hey, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| You may not have this figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| What was the, what was John's projected revenues for last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| or for this current year we're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| What did he project last year as revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| I guess the projected, yeah, I guess it is revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| If you look at, and you're talking about just the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| you want us to focus on general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| We projected general fund revenue at 152.6 million dollars for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4817)|
| 1:20:26| excuse me, that was actual for 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| We projected an FY12 revenue of 149.2 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4828)|
| 1:20:37| That was projected in 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| No, that was adopted in 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| So that was our projections for 12 was the 149.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| What did they, so we're not, where are we at right now with that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| A lot of our revenues are collected in arrears, so it's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| But we feel pretty good that we'll meet our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| And so much so that we think we can take 3 million dollars from savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| and do the reading program that the mayor talks about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| We've talked about doing a $500,000 fuel contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| and $150,000 on the retrial expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| So we think we'll beat that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| but we already have a place where we're going to kind of commit that number to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| And I'd like to address, too, what the numbers that the trustee uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| about being $7 million ahead on property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| That's all of property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| That's current and delinquent and interest and penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| When we look at property tax, we look at current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| and that's what we base our opinion on the tax rate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| And if you look at that, and I looked at that this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| through May the 5th, which is what we've got in, we're 99.4% of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| And that's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| And we'll collect the rest of May, June, and we also accrue July and August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| So we will meet current year property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| I projected we'll get to about $9.95 a penny, and we had projected $9.88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| So that's a bit of an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| And so I think we're okay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| Norm, we were talking about what's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| When we closed out last year, what did we put into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Where are we sitting currently with our non-Rainy Day or whatever you want to call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| When we closed out in 2011, we added about $700,000 to the general fund-fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| And that puts us at about $43 million, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| I'm doing this in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| And so I think that's the second highest in the county's history, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| And when we look at trying to get to a triple-A bond rating, that comes into account, fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| and other things that they really want to tell you how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| But they like the fact that we hold back spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| We are conservative on our revenue estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| And so that's what we try to do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| And I would also point out that the adopted 212 number does not include the additional million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| and a half from the pay raise that was enacted in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| And we viewed that as a raise that was enacted six months early from the standpoint of if you ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| if we thought we were going to have the savings, we could wait until the end of this fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| and then do the raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Or we realized that we were really good on collections on business tax and sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| So we said, let's go ahead and do that and do it in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| And that's what the mayor wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| Some people said it was early like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Some people say it was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| Perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| So thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| So I do understand your bond indebtedness versus that extra dollars coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5045)|
| 1:24:15| But I will also say you budgeted a payment to the ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| when you said we don't have any additional funds, but you've added money to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| So how do you account for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| That's not extra to you, the way you all are budgeting, because you said we're going to put in X millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| So you're using that like a department or an account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| I'm trying to understand how you're accounting for that, how you're budgeting for a payment back, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| Reference to like the $3 million on the rating program, what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| And plus additional funds, I'm guessing, because you're going to also give money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| I mean, we're going to increase the general fund, correct, to get to the AAA bond rating is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5098)|
| 1:25:05| No, that's a way to possibly get to a AAA bond rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| is increase your fund balance, hold back on spending, and increase revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| But as far as the payment for the schools, for the $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5115)|
| 1:25:22| and those things that we are going to commit for next year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| we go through a process every year, and we do this usually, I think, in June or July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| and it's usually called designations, but GFOA has changed the terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| to where we will roll some money forward that can be used for other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| As an example, IT may have a project that they need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| and so we'll just they'll have some savings and we'll roll that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| And so what we're saying is revenues are really good right now, including sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5155)|
| 1:26:03| And so we think we will come in ahead of schedule, from what we budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| enough to be able to go ahead and fund the reading program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| and fund maybe a fuel contingency and a retrial expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| And it's something from fund balance, and we just transfer that over, like the three to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| so they'll have that in their fund 146, and the others will just go right back into the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| and we'll budget that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| And what's left over is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| Oh, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| From your budget, from what you're anticipating, after spending a trial expense in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| Whatever is left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| No, but how much are you saying, how much are you proposing is going to be left over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| Based on your conservative projections, what is your dollar amount after the additional costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| How much are you assuming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| I would, if I had to be put on the spot, I would say probably less than $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5219)|
| 1:27:07| because I think that those three things that I mentioned will take up most of the money that would be closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5227)|
| 1:27:15| into the fund balance that we'll use for those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| Do you see how it's a little, I understand trying to, and I agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5239)|
| 1:27:28| not understand, I agree with trying to conservatively anticipate what funds we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| But you have to base it on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| And, you know, if we're constantly coming in over, and I'm not saying we are, this is theoretical hypothetical, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5258)|
| 1:27:48| So if we're constantly coming in over, are we going to re-baseline and say, okay, well, things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| the last two years are here, so this is a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| It helps us and, you know, go through this budget to know, okay, well, what's the total dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| So when you, you know, when we don't know that, it kind of hampers this process a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| So that's just words of encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| You don't have to comment on that, but it would be nice to have a solid, we project to bring in this amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5290)|
| 1:28:19| and it's not, well, we'll get $3 million here, $150 million, and we'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| That, to me, is, you know, don't worry about what's going on behind the curtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| We would like to know what are you projecting, what are your models, how are we getting at that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5306)|
| 1:28:35| And my last, I guess, question, because I'm, you know, I understand that AAA rating is up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| and that's what we're shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| Now, we've been AA plus since when I know Ragsdale, so what year was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| 2009, 2010 sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| It was around there, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| So what does it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| I guess I would like to understand fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| Is there a fund balance number that gets us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| I know there are multiple things, but let's talk about fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| If that's a variable that we have to get to for a county of our size, what does a fund balance need to be to rank AAA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5347)|
| 1:29:17| I know there are other counties out there and other municipalities out there that are similarly sized that may be AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| What's our goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| Our goal, of course, is to get to AAA, but I would say that they will not tell you what you've got to do to get to AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5365)|
| 1:29:32| But you can look at other counties and see what they are, municipalities that are AAA and see what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| And there are a few that there are very few that are AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| But they will tell you that it's a variety of things from fund balance to revenue collections and holding back expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5384)|
| 1:29:56| I mean, there's a lot of things that go into getting to AA or AA plus or AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| But there's not an exact formula they will share with us that will say, here's what you've got to do to get to AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5401)|
| 1:30:08| Because I guess if they did that, then everybody would know what you'd have to do to get there, and they don't really want you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| So then once you get to AAA, what's the number of savings in terms of a bond or a percentage of monies borrowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5415)|
| 1:30:23| What kind of factor would that yield us with this additional tick or the last tick on this dial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5423)|
| 1:30:30| Because we're at B plus or A minus, I guess, where we are, to get to that A rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| You would be borrowing money at a lower percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| Now, what that percentage is, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| I think we're borrowing some money now at 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| So it may be 0.5, 0.6, 0.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| It would just be at a lower amount that we would be paying back interest on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| I guess my general, my point in general is, you know, and that's, I want a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5455)|
| 1:31:02| I don't really care about a journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| You know, this whole, we're on the way to AAA every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| We're on the way to AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| If that's, you know, if that's what we want to get, I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| And if it's going to yield us marginal, then, you know, I think we might need to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| I do think it was a big tick to get to AA plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| I'm looking at counties that were at AA and the ones that are at AA plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| We're in exclusive, we're in pretty, you know, exclusive company at this point, where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| And I think it's because of, you know, the diligence of you as staff and now you in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5501)|
| 1:31:49| But, you know, it's like, let's not do anything because we're trying to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| And if we're not getting there, if we're, you know, a long way away from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| if that's not really a place that we want or it's going to yield us any big benefits, I want to get my arms around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| So I'm going to start asking questions in that regard because, you know, it feels kind of like a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5531)|
| 1:32:19| Leave us alone while we get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| And I'm fine with that, but I need to know what it means when we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| Okay, I don't care about a pat on the back or something, you know, a resume move as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| If it's going to yield us citizens some savings, some significant savings, then I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| If this is just, you know, an exercise that's going to yield us a quarter of a percent here or there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| $300,000 in a multimillion dollar budget, then, you know, I'm really wanting to move the county forward in other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5565)|
| 1:32:53| because there are other ways that we can move the county forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| I know we've kind of hunkered down here and, you know, we've carved out some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| And if that's a philosophical issue, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| And, you know, fine, we can move out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| But if it's to move the county forward so we can do more things, then that's the bandwagon I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| I would say that it's not a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| It's just a goal of the finance department, and I would say the mayor and the administration, to get to AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5595)|
| 1:33:22| And I will tell you, in FY11, we ended the fiscal year and we were $700,000 to the good compared to $152 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5602)|
| 1:33:34| I don't want to do math up here at the podium, but that's not a big amount as far as percentages go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| And so, if I would have, excuse me, if we would have overestimated our revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5623)|
| 1:33:52| and let's say that we estimated that we were going to get $154 million in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| and that we was $1.4 million to the bad and was using that much fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| then you all wouldn't be happy and the mayor wouldn't be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| So I think it's you should always be conservative in your estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| But I agree, you've got to be realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| But you don't want to overestimate what you think you're going to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| I mean, and then from there do your expenses, and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| But I just don't think that, you know, as an example, if we estimated in FY12 $988,000 per penny on the tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5666)|
| 1:34:38| we're probably going to get in somewhere between $993,000 and $995,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| That's not a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| That enables us to say, okay, in FY13 we're proposing $1,009,000 per penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| We can take those growths, and we get some of that, like, from the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5695)|
| 1:35:01| We sit down with the property assessor and said, okay, what type of growth can we expect with the NOVA coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| and just growth in current property tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| And they'll say somewhere between maybe $1.4 and $1.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| Well, we're right at $1.4, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| And so we try to look at it as a whole as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5717)|
| 1:35:25| And I don't think, don't take it as a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| It's just a goal of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| If our department could get, could help get the county as a whole to AAA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| and be higher than the United States rating, that's something to be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| And a half a percent on an interest rate when we're talking about $600 million in bonds could add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5742)|
| 1:35:52| Yeah, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| But we've also been holding our department heads for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| We've been keeping our pressure on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| I won't say our foot on them, but we've been, they've not been able to do things that I'm sure they would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| We've been keeping pressure on the salaries over this period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| So it comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| There's, you know, for every push you have, there's pressure in another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| I mean, there's only so much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| So there's, it's a confined environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| So when you pressure, there's a response from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| And I just want you all to understand, there's a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| They may not be telling you all because, you know, heck, fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I'm coming with a higher budget and you guys are going to say, okay, well, what about the next person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| You know, and I'm not talking, I've not spoken to any department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| So please don't take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| I haven't spoken to one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| So that's not where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| But it's just the law of a business, of an entity like a county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| There are consequences from keeping this pressure on for year after year after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| And all I'm saying is, at some point, people have to exhale and expand their programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| And thank you, Chris, for stepping in, picking up John's portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| So, as we have discussed a while, one cent on the tax rate, you just said $9.93, $9.95, maybe bumping over a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5836)|
| 1:37:25| But coincidentally, it's also a million dollars is a 1% raise for the employees, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| So, 3% raise is 3 cents on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Is that a, and that is, that'd be everybody in the, well, county employees, sheriff's people, everybody but Board of Education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5857)|
| 1:37:45| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| Exclusive of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Yeah, which includes the sheriff, but not the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| When I went on the pension board a couple of years ago, I found out that if it's 6%, it's not necessarily always 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| Sometimes it might be 6% is really 7.3 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| So, that, the longevity thing that Chairman Hammond mentioned, we do have quite a few employees, don't we, that there's a 12% match?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5884)|
| 1:38:14| Can it go to 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| It can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| So, when the UOP was put into place, we gave general county employees kind of an incentive as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| saying that if you've been here five years and you want to put in 8%, the county will match 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| If you've been here 10 years and you want to put in 10, the county will match 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| And then when you get to 15 years, it's 12 and 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| But I think, and I may be wrong, but I want to think less than 25% take advantage of the additional O over the 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5918)|
| 1:38:46| I think it's 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| We can't, we do go to a 12% and the employee puts in 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| I applaud your efforts to get to AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| I guess I need to get on the Internet and try to find some, I don't know of any cities or counties that are AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| I'm sure there are a few out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| And we have looked up and have done a lot of research saying what does it take to get to AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| And, you know, they'll give you some, I guess, points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| but they're not going to give you their formula on what it takes to get to AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| Well, that's an admirable goal and I hope we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| John occasionally had conversations with us, and I'll be brief on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| and it still worries me the interest rate swaps we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| I think we have a letter of credit with BB&T, and I think we got a new bank, didn't we, for the second letter of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| I had a Dutch bank or a bank from the Netherlands or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| Yeah, and I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| I wouldn't have to defer to our bond expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Just ride hard on that because, you know, you see that it's not directly what the J.P. Morgan thing is in the last four or five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| but it's unwinding, you know, they're trying to unwind their stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| And I've always ‑‑ John and I talked about unwinding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| and also unwinding can be more dangerous than riding the thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| Yeah, and we have talked about some of that, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| and right now it's not to our advantage to swap those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| Try to unwind, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| But you just look, I think Chairman Hammond mentioned it in his lunch a month or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| four hours down the road, Jefferson County, Alabama, and that was interest rate swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Of course, it was a sewer system, but still it's the swaps that put them in bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| So I hope you'll, you know, ride hard on those things because they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| that's only one of the few parts of our bonds, the money that we've borrowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6043)|
| 1:40:51| that concerns me that could flat blow up on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| I guess that's it because, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Mr. Bross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| This is the problem I have with the, or what I feel like is an issue with the race to the AAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6062)|
| 1:41:14| which, and I agree, it's a great goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| but the problem I'm having is that I feel like it's being used as a political tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| And my example for that is last year, or this was more than a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| when we wanted to buy the new cars, the sheriff's finance department told us, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6090)|
| 1:41:38| we really shouldn't do that because it's going to affect whether or not we can improve our bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| It will have a really significant effect on bond rating if we do something like that in the middle of the budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6103)|
| 1:41:51| And then this last year when the mayor wanted to give raises in the middle of the budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| suddenly it wasn't a problem anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| Can I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| The difference there is simply this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| When we did the cars, that came straight from fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6121)|
| 1:42:07| and our rating agencies will say they do not like you to tap into fund balance in the middle of a fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6127)|
| 1:42:15| What we did with the raises is we said we didn't hit fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| What we hit was we did an estimation and appropriation on business tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| which was coming in better than we had anticipated, and sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| So those are different in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| And I realize it's not fair for me to come down on you because John was the one who was standing up there at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| But, no, what John didn't make that distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| What John said was that, no, they look at these kinds of expenditures in the middle of a budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| It didn't matter if it came out of fund balance or if it came from something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| So I think that, and I appreciate that that's your perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| but what I heard at the time was something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| So, and I agree that we have crunched and crunched and crunched and put the pressure on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| and everybody's cut, and our revenues are up, and that's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| And things are starting to recover and look better, and that's a fabulous thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| And there are a lot of people in the county, different departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| who have gone without things that not just that they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| but things that they need to do to be able to provide services to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| And I, for one, am anxious to start giving a little bit of that back so that they can do these things that they've needed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6209)|
| 1:43:40| for all these years that we've told them, no, just wait until things get a little bit better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| and then, you know, you can get that piece of equipment, or you can give your employees raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| or you can do whatever it is that they've been needing to do for all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| So I question whether or not this culture of austerity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6234)|
| 1:44:02| and I'm certainly not in favor of going out and blowing money or wasting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| We need to be as efficient as we can with what we're given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| But I think it's time for us to move beyond this culture of austerity towards not going out and going crazy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6251)|
| 1:44:19| but catching up with some of these really needed expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| These aren't things that people want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| These are things that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| So that's all I'm going to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| Chris, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Just a couple more points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| And I promise I'll sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| We think about fund balance, about what's in there, like, and that it stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| But I would point out, too, and this came from Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| He makes a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Simply that the first three months of the year when there's no property tax coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| that's what we use to keep from dipping into our investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| and having to pull those investments out to keep from going in the negative on cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| So it's important to keep a healthy fund balance for that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| And the other point I would make as it relates to raises, and we used the date in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| if you look back what happened January 1, 2008, it was when the UOP was enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6319)|
| 1:45:26| And so, basically, that increase, a 2% increase in the UOP this year is $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6326)|
| 1:45:36| And so if you take the amount from 6% to 17%, then, you know, that could be a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| I'm not saying do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| I'm just saying that you can trace that back to that point to see where raises stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| And I would submit that's why they stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| And thank you for accepting this responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| I'm not sure whether you want to maintain it or not after some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| But we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| And I personally appreciate you greatly for your help when you helped me so many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| with various aspects of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=6380)|

| 2:05:57| Did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Amy Burrows has a question for you, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| I need a booster seat or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| It's not really a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| I just wanted to publicly thank Hugh for all the work that they did on, again, on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7564)|
| 2:06:13| Oakwood School Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| That community is very excited about what's happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| And I know Grant's not here today, and he was also part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| And also, what you all have done with, and I know we're going to talk more with Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| about this when he gets back, but what you all have done with the defined service contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| I know that was a lot of work doing it differently this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| And I think you all did a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| I'm really, really impressed with how you all put it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| So thank you so much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| It was a privilege to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| Next up, the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| Ms. Black, thank you so much for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| Our budget is basically a continuation budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| We have a great staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| We will continue to provide the level of service that we are providing currently, no reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| in services, no adjustments in services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| We served approximately 1.6 million people last year, and we circulated 2.2 million items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7622)|
| 2:07:09| That's terrific numbers for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| And we are pleased with our budget, and we will move forward and be creative with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7633)|
| 2:07:19| we can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| How do you interact with the University of Tennessee library system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| Is there synergies there between the Knox County Library and the university?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| We have several people that serve on mutual committees, the Center for Children's Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| there as well as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| We have collaboration for program planning, program support, grant support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| We also have interlibrary loan that we traffic each week with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| We participate in the School of Library Information Science at UT with various memberships on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7667)|
| 2:07:54| committees and those kinds of things, but we do collaborate with them on programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7674)|
| 2:08:00| Any questions for the libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| Seeing none, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| I wanted to just briefly, or just to mention the commission budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| It's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7691)|
| 2:08:12| There was no increase in the commission budget as you've seen, and so any questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| It's the way it was last year, so there's not any increase there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| No iPad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| Unless Mr. Moran wants to get us some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| Next we have the discussion of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| That includes our department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| Commissioner Andrews, you wanted to bring up an item, Commissioner McKenzie did as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| but we'll go to Commissioner Andrews first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| Briefly, just for the commission, I'm pretty comfortable with most of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| There is one thing that I've been involved with, economic development, since I came on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7723)|
| 2:08:48| commission, or actually before I came on commission, and last year there was a significant decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7728)|
| 2:08:55| in economic development budget through the chamber, through the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| and I would encourage, I would ask that at least, I think last year they got cut 50 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7740)|
| 2:09:09| and another significant amount this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| I would ask you to research, call Rhonda and call Doug, talk to them about what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| do and understand the process, and the development corporation, and it's not just buying land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7758)|
| 2:09:28| and building roads, it's maintaining business parks that they have, marketing parks, maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7768)|
| 2:09:34| and upkeep on the business incubator out in Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| There's so much that they do that we don't talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| It's easy to bash them because, you know, the business growth that we'd love to see is not here because of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7782)|
| 2:09:49| But I think it's important that, and I'll bring in a budget amendment before on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| and to do some restoration of the funds, but I want you to study it before you make a decision on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| and contact Rhonda and Doug and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7801)|
| 2:10:06| And if you've got any questions, I'll be happy to sit down and talk to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7806)|
| 2:10:10| but I'm pretty confident in the economic development work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| I mean, we've been, Mike and I, have been battling over the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| and butting heads over that and disagreeing, but these are two different issues to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| and I think that we need to consider what we're doing with economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7822)|
| 2:10:30| Mr. Edwards, do you or anyone want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7830)|
| 2:10:36| Since you're here and he brought it up, I wanted to see if you wanted to make a comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7836)|
| 2:10:44| I'm happy to, Mr. Chairman, if there's questions, but as Commissioner Andrews says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| we have taken a significant reduction in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| We have kept our staff the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| We've been fortunate and able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| but it is obviously going to impact our program areas and what we're going to continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| We've received national recognition for our brand and what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| and really getting a lot of traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| I feel like the economy is slowly but surely starting to turn around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| but with the reduction, we're not going to be able to keep the same level of activity going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7874)|
| 2:11:20| and I think it does have a significant impact on our economic growth for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| Real quick, I think, Rondo, last year in Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| along with Commissioner Briggs and Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| we were reduced by one employee on last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| I think there's, what, three now total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| So a 25 percent reduction in employment in last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| So I think it would be wise not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| Commissioner Andrews, like you said, it's not just one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| It impacts small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7914)|
| 2:11:55| It impacts our existing industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| A lot of things that don't get the media attention, that don't get the flash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| you know, our minority development programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| and things that we've spent considerable resources building over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| So the cuts are broad spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| Did you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| Yes, just very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| Todd Napier with the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| Last year we took a $100,000 cut, and it's being proposed for another $100,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7940)|
| 2:12:27| The main way we responded and dealt with that last year, as Brad mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| was we had to lay an employee off and cut back on some things that we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| Development Corporation is a service organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| It was created by Knox County back in 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| We're very accountable to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| I like to think that we're on the same team, because we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| and we're providing services that would otherwise have to be provided by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| if we're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| I'm not sure where $100,000 in cuts come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| short of just shutting some things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| We've also taken over some services, like at Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| We handle the mowing that we took over from Parks and Rec about five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| So we deliver services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| There was not really any fluff in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| It wasn't there to be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| And we just ask that as you look at the overall budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8004)|
| 2:13:31| how can we continue to fund the responsibilities that we were doing without the funds there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8011)|
| 2:13:40| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| Sort of as a counter to that, though, on the economic development side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| of course we're all in favor of economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| I'm sure the Chamber will be able to experience a savings this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8032)|
| 2:13:57| because they won't have to spend several hundred thousand dollars fighting the Hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8037)|
| 2:14:01| So there you go for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| And also along those lines, in the planning efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8044)|
| 2:14:10| which we think are very important to economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8050)|
| 2:14:15| I would emphasize that the Metropolitan Planning Commission's budget has been cut as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| So that's a consideration that I certainly would like for the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| and for finance to consider as we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| and as funds become available or we have some excess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8071)|
| 2:14:32| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| Yes, I would like to ask, and I'm not opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| I was concerned last year about cuts made in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8077)|
| 2:14:43| and I was concerned last year also about cuts to MPC and Amigan this year, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| because that is they do play a vital role for us that no one else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| But I would like to get a report or information on the top five salaried positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8092)|
| 2:14:59| what the total compensation package is for each of those salaries and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8099)|
| 2:15:06| because it seems like every time we talk about any group or any department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| you know, we're doing that with the schools now, and we're talking about giving them more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| We keep talking about central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| So I just want all that information on everybody that we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| So I would find that helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| You get the top five, I think you're going to get it for everybody that works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| I think the chamber has a pretty big –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| This isn't the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| This is the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| I would like it for – actually, I should say for the chamber and the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| I would like that information on both groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| Go back for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| On page 18 under revenue summary, wheel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| and you might have covered – somebody might have covered this before I got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| but I was unavoidably detained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| This year it was $9.5 million, and we're cutting it down to $0.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| What's the story there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| The wheel tax is supposed to be going to the library right now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| It is in the FY13 budget and in FY12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| What it is is there was a GASB pronouncement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| It's GASB 54 that states that special revenue funds have to have a sole revenue source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8183)|
| 2:16:31| So what we had to do to keep that separate was to designate the wheel tax towards libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8191)|
| 2:16:37| So the $9.5 that was going in 11 to wheel tax and general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8197)|
| 2:16:43| now the majority of that is going to the libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8203)|
| 2:16:50| and we're just not doing a transfer from the general fund to the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| It's neutral, but it's just a way so we can –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| when we come to reporting, we can report those separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| and not have to include them in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| Where does it show up on this page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| You won't – if you turn – if you got your book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| if you turn to page 38,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8230)|
| 2:17:17| that will give you a detail of the wheel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| and if you go to the far right column, it'll see proposed 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| I think 500,000 goes to general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| a little over 10.5 million goes to public libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| and 1.5 million goes to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8252)|
| 2:17:40| So basically all it was was in order to keep that fund separate in our CAFR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| we had to put that revenue source towards public libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8265)|
