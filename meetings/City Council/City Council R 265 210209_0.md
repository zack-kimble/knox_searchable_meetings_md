| 0:06:36| Good evening everybody and just as a preface, I've been doing in the last few months as allowed by Governor Lee's executive orders in response to the coven 19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=396)|

| 0:06:56| Seeing no objection I'll move on to the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| This week, we surpassed a grim milestone in the pandemic, we marked our 500 coven 19 related death and Knox County.

| 0:07:15| virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Although we've seen a major shift in focus to vaccines, we still have a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| The best way to honor those who've lost their lives to this virus is by staying vigilant and practicing all of the safety measures advised by our health care leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=441)|
| 0:07:30| It's also an opportunity to reflect on the overall state of public health locally. And remember that there are many health challenges and health disparities to consider as we work collectively to promote a healthy community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=450)|
| 0:07:41| I'd like to invite Dr. Martha Buchanan who is with us tonight to give us an overview of the latest community health assessment, as well as a brief update on coven in our community, Dr Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=461)|

| 0:08:03| Mr. Johnson, make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| You should be able to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Okay, and then I'm going to see if I can do it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| All right, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| should not be on the last slide but that's okay we'll just get on back to the other slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| So, thank you so much for the opportunity to talk about health in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=507)|
| 0:08:35| This is our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| I'm going to move everybody out of the way. This is our 2019 community health assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| It should have been presented to you earlier in 2020 but the pandemic kind of sidelined that so we're presenting it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=523)|
| 0:08:52| The data was collected between 2005 and 2015 or 2015 sorry 2015 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=532)|
| 0:09:01| We do these about every four to five years, and it is our, it really is our assessment of the health of the community of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=541)|
| 0:09:12| And it really is our, our most important document that we release, because it was used, hopefully used by you and other decision makers and policy setters, as well as nonprofits to fund the things that they're doing to address the health of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=552)|
| 0:09:29| So, it's gathered from data from lots of different, different sources, local sources we use actual what we call the YRBS, which is the Youth Behavior Risk Survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=569)|
| 0:09:45| That's data gathered from Knox County middle schools and high schools, as well as the Behavior Risk Factor Survey which is data that's gathered from people over the age of 18 who live in Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=585)|
| 0:09:58| As well as many other sources to compile this data, it takes about five years in our epidemiologist use. It's been a lot of time compiling this data, and that all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=598)|
| 0:10:14| There we go. We'll keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| It really is crucial in raising awareness of our health in our community. And I think one of the big differences when this report and what we do, we're doing with COVID is the vetting of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=617)|
| 0:10:35| Anybody who works with data knows that you really have to vet the data to make sure it's accurate and really depicting what's really going on. Unlike what we're doing with COVID, which is real time data reporting, which is a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=635)|
| 0:10:47| And if you've been watching, we've occasionally had to make corrections. So we hope this document is used to inform decisions throughout our community and that many people will use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=647)|
| 0:11:02| We try to make it simple and easy to understand with lots of graphics. And we really believe that it can really help people see what the health issues are in our community, but not just see what the health issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=662)|
| 0:11:16| And I'll get to this a little bit in a minute, but see what's contributing to the health issues in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| It's one thing to say we have a problem with mental health or we have a problem with obesity or we have a problem with whatever. But the other thing is to say, what are the things that contribute to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=682)|
| 0:11:31| It's not just about access to care. And so what are the things that are contributing to those underlying health issues that we're seeing chronically in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=691)|
| 0:11:42| One example of how this document is used is that Covenant Health, one of our primary, one of our larger health providers, uses this to fulfill their IRS requirement to do a community health needs assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=702)|
| 0:11:54| And they also base their community outreach on the data in this document. So we're really thrilled that they do that. They have a very wide reach in our community, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=714)|
| 0:12:07| So what I was talking about before is this is something we added this year, the drivers of health. Drivers of health are those things that contribute to health or lack thereof across our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=727)|
| 0:12:19| And it's socioeconomic factors, physical environment, health behaviors, and health care. You'll notice that health care is only 20 percent of what contributes to our health in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=739)|
| 0:12:29| Health care is very important, but again, it's only 20 percent. The majority of our health outcomes really are impacted by socioeconomic factors in the physical environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=749)|
| 0:12:41| When we look at those health behaviors, you have to remember those health behaviors are made within the socioeconomic and physical environment that the person lives in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=761)|
| 0:12:51| So those things, they're all interrelated because if you, when you lack resources and you have to make choices about food or activity, it impacts what you can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=771)|
| 0:13:06| So all of those choices are connected. And if we can impact the physical environment and socioeconomic factors, we'll have a much higher impact on the health of our community than if we try to impact access to care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=786)|
| 0:13:23| So I think it's important to understand that. And I think the other thing that's important to understand is that we understand that economics and education impact our health, but the opposite is also true, that health impacts our education and economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=803)|
| 0:13:42| Because if you're not healthy, it's hard to learn. And if you're not healthy, you're going to not be present at work. You're going to have more absenteeism or presenteeism, as they say. So you'll be there, but not be as productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=822)|
| 0:13:53| So it impacts our business's bottom line to have an unhealthy workforce. So I think it's something that all of us as leaders need to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=833)|
| 0:14:03| So this report is produced by the health department. And next, what happens is that our community health council will take this document and create priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=843)|
| 0:14:15| And they'll look through it and look at the data and look at the information in the document and create a list of health priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=855)|
| 0:14:24| Access to mental health care, substance misuse, obesity or lack of physical activity, and tobacco use among pregnant women and teens were prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=864)|
| 0:14:36| And out of that implementation, out of that plan, they'll create the community health improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| Out of that plan came the All for Knox movement, which is now implementing its plan. That resulted from this document and the community health improvement plan that the community health council created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=882)|
| 0:14:56| You all will all get paper copies. I encourage you to look at this. It's also available online. Please share it with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=896)|
| 0:15:05| We really want decision makers and people who are looking at the well-being of our community to use this document in decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=905)|
| 0:15:14| And that's really all I have. I'm happy to answer questions about that. And I mean, I can also answer questions about the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=914)|
| 0:15:23| But I thought we'd focus just on the community health improvement plan and answer questions about that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| OK. Thank you so much, Dr. Buchanan. Council members, do you have any questions for Dr. Buchanan about this community health assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=930)|
| 0:15:45| OK, well, I would just say that this is a very good foundational assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| I think it's actually helpful that it happened the year before the pandemic because it's a baseline. And we will the next time you do one, you know, hopefully, you know, have that baseline and see how maybe we've learned from or made some progress because the pandemic has revealed that these vulnerabilities that exist all the time are really affecting people when it comes to dealing with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=951)|
| 0:16:18| Councilwoman Ryder. Yeah, Dr. Buchanan, I just wanted to ask you, so we'll be getting paper copies. Do you know what the time frame is for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| I believe Erin Reid with my team is on the phone. She is on the phone on the call. She might know the time frame better than I. Erin, do you know the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=986)|
| 0:16:37| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| OK, the time frame I'm getting those in the mail this week, so you'll have them within a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1000)|
| 0:16:48| OK, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Any other questions or comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| OK, well, Dr. Buchanan, thanks for sharing this with us. We understand that you had other things preoccupying you and your staff's attention in the last year, and I know that that continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1017)|
| 0:17:09| Yes, Mayor, I did have a question, and it was just kind of, I guess, a structural question, Ms. Buchanan, about how the vaccines are being distributed within the state and then out into the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1029)|
| 0:17:22| Could you just kind of give us an overview of the status of that and kind of how those are divvied out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1042)|
| 0:17:33| Sure. So it starts at the federal level, and the federal government tells the state of Tennessee, you have this many doses for this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1053)|
| 0:17:44| I believe they get notified from the federal government midweek, like on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| And then the state looks at what they have. They look at the population. They look at a few other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| They look at how many people you have in the phase groups as well, and then they distribute that further across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1076)|
| 0:18:05| And just to give you a little perspective, the state of Tennessee is only getting about 90,000 to 95,000 doses a week, I believe, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1085)|
| 0:18:16| So that's not very many to cover the population of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| So they're having to divvy that out across the 95 counties with extremely varying populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| And obviously, Nashville and Shelby County get more than we do, and then Hamilton and the other metros are behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1108)|
| 0:18:39| But it is divvied out in that manner. And then once we get that information, there have been some providers who've been activated, which means they can receive and give vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1119)|
| 0:18:50| And you'll see that some of those will be giving vaccine this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| The hospitals are getting vaccine. We are getting vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| And now a handful of providers, mostly pharmacies, actually, and our FQHCs and safety net providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| That would be Interfaith and Cherokee Health. They'll be vaccinating their at-risk patients who are in the current phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| They serve an at-risk population, so that's a really appropriate thing to try to help with the equity issue of vaccine distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| And so that's how it's happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| We hope that will eventually shift so that they have enough vaccine, people in disorder, directly from the state, and we can stop being the middleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| But right now, we're kind of the middleman, working with all those partners to really communicate and make sure that we're trying to distribute the vaccine as equitably as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1171)|
| 0:19:42| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Okay. Thank you, Dr. Buchanan. Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| No question. Just thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for the yeoman's work you and your team have been doing for the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| I know it gets said. It can't be said enough. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Dr. Buchanan, I know you announced today that starting tomorrow, there'll be a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| And I know you and your team have worked really hard to get whatever the computer database systems are to make that really effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1209)|
| 0:20:20| I believe our 311 operators from the city are going to help field calls starting tomorrow because not everyone has access to the internet or some people just prefer to call by phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1220)|
| 0:20:31| So I'm really glad we could support you in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Is there anything you want to share with Council about that waiting list? I know a lot of our constituents have been asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| Yes, they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| A lot of constituents have been asking, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| So, no, we're really, really happy. We're really grateful to County IT and their team and my team for working out the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1245)|
| 0:20:54| I think we have a system that will allow folks to get on a waiting list, but also at the same time only allow folks who qualify for vaccine to get on that waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1254)|
| 0:21:08| So we don't have to go through and decide who qualifies and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| They do that. They answer those questions on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| So I think that's a good feature because it allows some more streamlining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| Our goal is to streamline this as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| We acknowledge certainly that some folks either don't want to, don't have the access, whatever, are not going to sign up online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| They can call the 311, or they can call 215-5555, and somebody will walk them through the process of getting put on that wait list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1293)|
| 0:21:43| And what we'll do is we'll work that wait list first come, first serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| As we have vaccine available, folks will be notified of appointment opportunities and will, I'm sure, sign up for those appointment opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1308)|
| 0:21:58| And so we are excited to offer this to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Eventually, this will also be a registration platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| That's just going to take a little more time to work through the details of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| And Council Member Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Dr. Buchanan, there's the web link that some of us and different people in the community have shared about signing up for both paid and unpaid volunteer opportunities, medical and non-medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1332)|
| 0:22:26| Can you touch on, like, I know myself and others who've signed up haven't heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| How is that being handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| What's the, I know you guys have a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Is that, it's a state level thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| And what should people expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Do you need tons of volunteers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Like, everybody wants to know how they can help facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Well, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| And I'll have to claim that I don't know, and it is a state level system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| And I don't know how it exactly works to get folks down to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| I know that we are using the volunteers or some volunteers that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| And I will have to actually, honestly, circle back with my team to understand better how they utilize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| And if we're not making full use of that, I think we need to look at why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| And, you know, are there volunteer opportunities that we're not taking advantage of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| I will say, I don't think we have any paid volunteer opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| I think we only have unpaid volunteer opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| I didn't know if, that's just how it's worded, and I think it's a state level thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Because when you go and register, you have to pick your county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| So, yeah, I think we need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| I know that we've had a lot of folks sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| And part of it is just vaccine supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| You know, we just don't have a ton of vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| So we're not, you know, again, as vaccine supply increases, I think we'll probably use more volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| And you have the new location that's going to be voted on for potential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Yes, for vaccine center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| The nice thing about that is that it's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| And we don't have to worry about events being scheduled and getting, you know, not getting kicked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| but having to move and not have opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And that is, you know, the thing right now, the way they're doing it is if you give the first dose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| you're obligated to give the second dose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| And then we need to be able to say, okay, we're giving you a dose today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| And in 21 or 28 days, you can come back here and get your second dose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| We can't always do that with the expo center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| So this is going to be nice for my staff to have that predictability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for that presentation and all that you and your staff are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| You know, one of the things that really jumped out at me during the presentation was the percentage of social economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| income and impact has on the disparities on health disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| And so I think that speaks to underserved communities that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| And just want to ask you, as it relates to the second doses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| what percentage of people are we seeing coming back timely for the second dose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| Do you have that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| I don't have that information off the top of my head, but my gut says it's very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| But I don't have that information off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| We can certainly check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| We actually have somebody who's helping coordinate folks who know they can't be around for their second dose for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1526)|
| 0:25:37| So we're helping coordinate getting them into another opportunity for vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| So there's a lot of moving parts for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Right now, what we're doing is when you get, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Sorry, that's my dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| I should have silenced, taken the bell away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| She's wanting to go outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| So right now we need to vaccinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| We do take recesses as needed if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| I'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| She really needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| You know, that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| It's harder to open the door yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| I'm working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| So right now when you get vaccinated, you're given the date and time of your next vaccination right then and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1574)|
| 0:26:22| And we know when that's going to be, and you're scheduled for a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| But we do have a system in place for those who can't be there, but it's a great question to see how many people are coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1585)|
| 0:26:33| But I'm pretty sure it's a really high percentage, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| And then also want to thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| And also please keep on your radar just the logistics in underserved communities with those folks that don't have access to transportation that's readily and also with their caregivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1601)|
| 0:26:53| I know that there's some other groups that are working on trying to help coordinate some efforts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| So we'll continue to look forward to that collaborative effort moving forward in those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| And thank you for the work you're doing to help us get those folks vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| And I know we've been able to offer the Jacobs Building in Chihuly Park numerous times for testing events and also the Coliseum parking garage a couple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1632)|
| 0:27:23| So we have properties that are suitable and in good locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| We're happy to step in and offer those again as it makes sense to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Thank you for the community health assessment and for all your work on COVID response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| We are glad that the vaccines are here, but looking forward to more supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Any other questions for Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| Okay, thank you very much for your time and your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| Please extend our thanks to your whole staff too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Okay, Council, just to wrap up my Mayor's remarks, just wanted to mention a couple things in the week ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| As you know, this Thursday is our annual budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| While we won't be meeting in person, I am still looking forward to the opportunity to discuss our mid-year budget update with each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1695)|
| 0:28:22| In addition to hearing from finance on the state of the city's finances, my leadership team and I will share information about our strategic priorities and objectives that we are focusing on in the year ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1702)|
| 0:28:33| So that's this Thursday, February 11th, 9 a.m. on Zoom, and members of the public and media are invited to listen in via CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1713)|
| 0:28:42| Also, this Thursday night, the 11th, our latest class of KPD recruits will be graduating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| We are excited and grateful for the men and women who have chosen to devote their career to serving and protecting our great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| As you all know, just this past year, we've made a concerted effort to strengthen our recruitment efforts, and that push seems to be coming just as many of our officers are nearing retirement, as you saw in tonight's consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1734)|
| 0:29:06| We are making some progress, and we are continuing to work to address areas where we haven't seen much growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| So, Chief Thomas, if you could just take a couple minutes to share with council members some of the successes that we've seen in our recruitment efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1751)|
| 0:29:19| Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Thank you, Mayor. I appreciate it, and good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| I appreciate the opportunity to talk and really to thank you for allocating the money a couple years ago for our recruitment marketing plan, that we have finally come to fruition with this class that will begin in March, March 29th, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1763)|
| 0:29:40| And we selected in our process Robin Easter Design and Ackerman Marketing, but I wanted you to know that it's not just about marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| We've got some really cool recruitment logo, a website, billboards, and, of course, we're highlighting what a great city that Knoxville is to live in as well, so Knoxville's gaining from those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1789)|
| 0:29:59| But also, as part of that plan, we looked at our process, our hiring process, and it dovetailed perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| The synergy was there to work with the new HR department as well as civil service on making that process more efficient and a little bit quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1806)|
| 0:30:15| We're working on implementing a new test this very next time for our October class that can be given remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| We've selected one, work with civil service and HR, and so we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| We'll be able to take that on the road with us to criminal justice programs or military bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| We've shortened the hiring timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| When I came on, it was about 13 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| We're down to about five-and-a-half months right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| We also, you all, last year approved a position called the Public Safety Recruit position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| So if we have someone who is in that five-and-a-half-month process that is very promising, we can actually offer them a job without civil service protection so that they have a job within the police department doing non-enforcement duties until the academy starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1846)|
| 0:31:01| So that is a huge thing for people coming out of the military or graduating from college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| If at any point they fail out of that process, that job does go away, but it allows us to get them hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| Another part of that was our lateral program where we are hiring people who have previous experience and paying them for that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| It's a shortened academy, a longer field training officer program, so the 26 weeks is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| It's just rather six weeks in the classroom, and the rest of the time is actually spent on the road with another officer, so they'll graduate together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| In this class this Thursday night, we'll actually have 20 graduating, and three of those will be our very first laterals, one from Fairfax County, Virginia, one from LAPD, and one from Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1893)|
| 0:31:45| And we've gotten positive feedback on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| I think we have eight in our process for the March 29th class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| We're really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| So as I said, this has come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| We had 53 that we selected for this March class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| We're probably going to lose somewhere between 15 and 18, but we're still looking at a class in the 30s, which we have not had for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| I right now have 62 open positions, so in our October class, we could possibly be even where we needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1925)|
| 0:32:15| You allocating that money a couple of years ago and us doing the hard work with Wabanista and Ackerman has really come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for that work and ask if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1942)|
| 0:32:31| Okay. Thank you, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Okay, the last thing I want to mention on the mayor's report is just to take a moment to celebrate and recognize Black History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| While February is designated as Black History Month, of course, it's important to recognize that black history is woven into our fabric every day and should be celebrated and studied year round because black history is American history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1963)|
| 0:32:55| In the city, we have a section of our website that is dedicated to sharing and honoring the many contributions of black residents that have helped shape Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| That includes some of our more famous names like Nikki Giovanni and Alex Haley, as well as everyday leaders who have left their mark on city government and the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1983)|
| 0:33:12| People like Luther Bradley, one of the city's first African American firefighters and ultimately a deputy chief and fire marshal, and Gerald Dede Dozier, the first black female cat bus driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=1992)|
| 0:33:23| We will be adding new content this month and I encourage you to check out the page and learn more about the history and heritage of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| So, that concludes my mayor's report. Are there any reports from council members or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2011)|
| 0:33:40| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| Thank you, Mayor. I just want to take a quick moment and thank Reese Gabrielson, who recently built and installed benches at the West Hills Park pickleball courts as a part of his Eagle Scout project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2023)|
| 0:33:58| We don't always have nice, fun news like that to report these days, but it was really nice to get out to the park, even though it was a little bit rainy and cold that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2038)|
| 0:34:09| But to see a young person doing all that work, and I think that those benches will be something that people will enjoy at the pickleball courts for a long time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2049)|
| 0:34:18| So, I just wanted to mention that. Thank you, Reese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| Thank you, Reese. Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| Any other reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Okay, seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| We'll move on into item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment of Caitlin Chesney to the Better Building Board of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| Motion made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by Council Member Singh. Any questions or comments or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| Please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2101)|

| 0:35:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| And Council Member Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Okay, motion carries 9-0. Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| 10B is an ordinance approving an appeal by Benjamin C. Mullins for Acre-Kingston Pike T5 LLC of Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission's denial of a request for rezoning from CG3 to CG1 for property located at 8002 Kingston Pike 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2125)|
| 0:35:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Okay, motion made to approve by Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Okay, seconded by who said that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Just as a reminder, we haven't had a zoning appeal in a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| So on the appeal, there's three speakers for up to five minutes each in favor, three speakers up to five minutes each opposed, two minutes in rebuttal for the appellant, and then a discussion and vote by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2160)|
| 0:36:11| So we have a motion and now, let's see, 10B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| I'm looking at the list of people who signed up for 10B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Mr. Johnson, you'll have to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| As far as I can tell, it's Ben Mullins and Michael Alterman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| Is there anyone else who signed up to speak for 10B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| And they're both in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Am I reading your list correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Mayor, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Benjamin Mullins has signed up to speak and Michael Alterman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| And that's it for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Mr. Mullins, if you could start by saying your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Baker Kingston Pike T5 LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| Also, as you mentioned, Michael Alterman is with the applicant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2222)|
| 0:37:10| And he's here to answer any questions about the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| This rezoning started as a prior zoning equivalent request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Previously, this property was zoned C3, and the prior zoning equivalent would have been the CH zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| However, after consultation with planning staff, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| we understood that there would be reluctance to move the CH zone south of Kingston Pike in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2251)|
| 0:37:40| The concept for this zone is very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| The applicant wants to place two complementary businesses on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| one being a drive-thru coffee shop, Scooter's Coffee, which is a national franchise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| and also a Take 5 oil change repair shop as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| Because of the nature of the businesses that do require drive-thrus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| dealing with the setback restrictions of the CG3 and CG2 zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2290)|
| 0:38:19| they looked at potentially the CG1 zone, which does not require there to be any minimum setbacks on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2299)|
| 0:38:27| Both CG3 and CG2 require the property, the buildings on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| be anywhere from zero feet to 20 feet from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| And that presents a problem with regard to access for potential drive-thru businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| There's no difference in the uses in the CG1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| and the CG3 and CG2 zones also have a lot greater height requirements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2330)|
| 0:38:59| This was very thoroughly deliberated by planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| It was a close vote against at seven to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| And the conversation was more in line not with this particular applicant and its proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| but with the conversation that this council has had on other rezoning applications as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| with regard to the lack of the design standards in the CG1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| And we certainly understand and are sensitive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| However, that's not the reason why the CG1 zone is sought for for this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| It's because of the flexibility in being able to move the buildings further back away from the road to improve access on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2377)|
| 0:39:46| We actually designed this with these buildings and this development with the CH zoning in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2386)|
| 0:39:57| But a big difference in this application and other applications where the CG1 has been debated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| and its lack of design standards is the fact that these uses will require a special use application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| We've actually already filed for a special use application, which is pending and on hold with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2409)|
| 0:40:19| With that, I believe I cited you to our site plan and also some renderings that I have sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| Mr. Alterman has sent to you about our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| And, you know, the fact is that there will be further public input, further review of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| and further opportunity to discuss, you know, what makes sense and how this needs to be designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| with regard to the particularities of Kingston Pike and Winston Road in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| You know, the market has changed dramatically since the rezoning was affected in August of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2456)|
| 0:41:04| Drive-thru properties are a lot more valuable now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| And this moving to CG1 gives this applicant the flexibility to more properly design a drive-thru facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2468)|
| 0:41:17| that would serve a growing need and bring new business into the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| So for those reasons, and because we will have a special use application that will go through another public hearing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| we respectfully ask that you overturn Planning Commission's recommendation not to pass the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| and actually grant our appeal for CG1 zoning in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| I am here to answer any questions, and Mr. Alterman is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| He may want to follow up on some of the things that I have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Mr. Alterman, if you could unmute yourself and start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| and then you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| Hi, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| This is Michael Alterman, 2416 Thompson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| That's in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| I appreciate everyone's time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Ben pretty much covered the most important points, I think, to our application here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2532)|
| 0:42:22| I did want to make one comment, Ben, is that just for clarification, Take 5 is not a repair shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| Actually, we do four services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| It's strictly oil change, coolant, wiper blades, and filters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| There's no underground tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| It's a very efficient, clean, up-to-date and modern facility and process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| It's definitely different from some of those other type uses that you have seen maybe in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| or what's there on the property currently, as you probably know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| The Planning Commission's vote was a very close vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| and the main concern being about the CG1 design standards and less about our project as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| which we understand given some previous, I think, cases that have come before Planning Commission and council here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2586)|
| 0:43:17| As Ben mentioned, our strict concern and application here is regarding that required 20-foot setback to the front of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2597)|
| 0:43:29| It limits flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| It's not only for our use or scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| It would be for pretty much any practical use that could be applied to that property at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| And so the concern about that design standards is mitigated, as Ben mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| by the fact that we do have a special use process that we have not only designed to to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| We went through their checklist for the special use and designed this property accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| We feel confident that we'll meet the expectations of planning with those requirements on the plans that have been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2638)|
| 0:44:10| So we're excited to bring both these national concepts in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| These will be the first locations for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Both concepts have many other locations planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| And not only improving the property from what's there, but also bringing jobs in the community and being a valued member of the community of Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2662)|
| 0:44:35| So I'm here if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Thank you, Mr. Alterman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| Council member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| I've got a few questions for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| The first thing is looking at the change that's being proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| The CG one, which the applicants asking for that actually has more restrictions on how how tall the buildings can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2703)|
| 0:45:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| So it's 45 feet in the CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| And I know that the applicants discuss this and I know that it's come to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| You know, this is at least the second time I think that the CG one and the lack of design standards have come to to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2727)|
| 0:45:37| Was that a concern that the planning commissioners discussed in their deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| We did discuss that planning commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| And I share that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| And what I was wondering about is, do you feel like it would be a good idea for us to at least consider some design standards for CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2750)|
| 0:46:05| Given the input that we've received so far on this new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Yes, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| Long term, I think it would be a good idea to explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| You know, to consider design standards for the CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| And that may be something that that comes up at a, you know, later on, and have planning commission consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2779)|
| 0:46:29| For me, looking at this one, I think we have on the same stretch of Kingston Pike in more walkable areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| There's CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| You know, I think this this use, you know, it's really not about use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| The uses are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| It's about the flexibility of the of the kind of design a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| So, I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| So, I think it's I think it's a good thing to move forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| And I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Miss Brooks or director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Council member Roberto council member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| And then question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| I see that this is to drive through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| Is there any practical way to continue a sidewalk in front of this property or, or maybe there's one existing I don't know, but I just wondered how a drive through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2830)|
| 0:47:23| Could possibly coexist with a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| Is that a question for director Brooks or for the, I think it's for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| Yeah, Mr Alterman or Mr Mullins, could you address council member Thomas's question please. Yes, right now existing there is a very large curb cut along the front of the car care muffler shop that would need to be closed and the access would need to be more limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2857)|
| 0:47:54| We have dedicated space for a sidewalk along Kingston Pike, and also along Winston road, both, both frontages would require sidewalk as part of the special use application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2874)|
| 0:48:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Thank you council member Thomas council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| I have a question for director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| I did not see it mentioned in our materials but the design standards are often implemented around the city to also work as a traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2896)|
| 0:48:32| You know tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Was there any discussion by planning of whether that was an intended goal for this section of Kingston Pike I can imagine coming up, going towards the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2915)|
| 0:48:47| Sometimes your view is blinded a little bit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| But just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| That's a good question. No, the discussion and planning commission really centered around the difference between the CD one and the CD, CD three, and then also the, the number of uses that were being placed on this small site so it was really focused more on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2934)|
| 0:49:13| Then, then traffic concerns and when you look at the, the commercial design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2953)|
| 0:49:21| It's really focused on facade design and fenestration, it's not getting into circulation or access those are things that are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2961)|
| 0:49:31| When plans are submitted, and by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| But just one clarification the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| Having the setbacks closer to the road is there not a traffic calming effect with that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| There could be Kingston Pike is a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| Speeds are high on on Kingston Pike, and a lot of places yeah so that could be a potential impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| The slow traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Okay, Councilmember writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Yeah, so I intend to vote in favor of Councilman Roberto's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3006)|
| 0:50:14| I think I was really torn with this one and thought about it a lot last night and a lot today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| This is an example of where when the maps were planned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| This is basically a request to build something that's already there. This is the use that's there. When the maps were changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3026)|
| 0:50:36| And I completely understand where Mr Mullins and the applicant we're seeking a prior equivalency rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| This whole area was designated as an ideal area to go up and do mixed use and kind of create that downtown West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3043)|
| 0:50:53| But I think it puts us in this precarious position where we decided one side of the road is something that it's not currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| Versus the other side of the road gets to remain that CH style zoning, and we end up in this precarious position where we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3061)|
| 0:51:12| I mean, one good analogy is that we're, we're taking the existing painting and painting over it to make it something that it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3072)|
| 0:51:20| And at the same time, they're the businesses that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| That exists that are these design standards, so it was like we were designating this area is the ideal we wanted to change to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3084)|
| 0:51:33| To make it look more like a downtown in the West area, which it could very ideally be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| So, with this particular applicant, it's like we have a bird in the hand that wants to develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| Much exactly like it already exists today versus denying the zoning and making it be the commercial zones that are described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3106)|
| 0:51:57| And is enabled to do this with CG1 because it doesn't have the same distinctions for setbacks and lock coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| So, I'm going to support it because it's just such a struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| But this really was created because we outlined this area in the maps and decided, like, this is the place to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3128)|
| 0:52:17| But it didn't account for what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| And so, anyway, it's, it's, it's a, it's a planning dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3140)|
| 0:52:28| And so I definitely think I will just clarify since I brought up the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| Got design standards for CG1 regarding a previous zoning that was mentioned at the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| That was specifically because without standards on fenestration and speaking to the sidewalk and the entrances to pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3161)|
| 0:52:53| Access, you end up with buildings like what we got and I hate to look at a specific 1 and mention it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3173)|
| 0:53:00| But at the intersection of Broadway and Edgewood, we literally have a block wall with no windows and no doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| And when we did recode, we said we were going to not let that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| And so CG1 lets that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| This project does not ask for that, but CG1 without fenestration and acknowledging pedestrian access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| literally gives people the opportunity to build a wall with no acknowledgement of people walking up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| And I think that's what we need to change and have standards for so we can avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| So I just wanted to clarify the comments that were made at the planning commission in relation to the comments that I had made previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Director Brooks, I know there was a video of the planning commission meeting and there was a good discussion around the Sutherland area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3230)|
| 0:53:59| and there being some CG1 zoning in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| And I believe as a result of the now in the planning commission that it was suggested that this stretch of Kingston Pike be considered as part of a retreat down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3243)|
| 0:54:17| What's the ramification of this rezoning if another one is requested soon in that stretch of Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3257)|
| 0:54:28| It seems as though there was very intentional thought that went into this specific stretch, maintaining it as CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3268)|
| 0:54:38| Unless I'm wrong or missed something, this is the first request on that stretch for rezoning to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3278)|
| 0:54:47| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| That is a great question, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| The new zoning map and ordinance, it reflects, as you all know, an extensive process involving a lot of community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3293)|
| 0:55:02| And, you know, you mentioned the area in the, I think maybe in the Bearden area is what came up during the planning commission meeting, that discussion that that's CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3302)|
| 0:55:12| And there were three iterations, actually more than that, of the map itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| And so some of the comments from map two to three were suggesting and making the recommendation that that area, and I know we're not specifically talking about the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3316)|
| 0:55:28| but I think it's important to make a note of this, is that it had the CG3 on there because it is a more of a pedestrian-friendly oriented area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3328)|
| 0:55:39| And it was at the request of the community to change that to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| So that's how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| And the CG3 on this particular property and this particular block was placed here to form a transition between the CH to the north and the nearby residential zoning to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3343)|
| 0:55:54| And so it is more consistent with the intent and description of the adjacent mixed-use special district in the West City sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3354)|
| 0:56:04| And this is the first request that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| And I think the ramifications of this are that approval of this zoning request will set a precedent along this block for accepting CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3366)|
| 0:56:14| And I think that's something that this body and the planning commission as well, if it is, if the appeal is upheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| that we really need to think about that entire block and consideration of CG1 in this area specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| Does that answer your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| And I only ask because we had a similar request that I don't think it made it to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| but was raised by an owner of a property along Chapman Highway that I'm very familiar with and was surrounded by CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| And I think that they were looking for something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| And it just would have stuck out very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| And I'm just concerned that the planning staff has looked at this as part of recode and a holistic approach of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3409)|
| 0:57:01| a holistic look at it again, I think, would be more appropriate than this particular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3421)|
| 0:57:10| I'm pro-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| We should be as flexible as possible when somebody wants to open a business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| And I think that the Sutherland example that was discussed at planning commission could be relevant for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| but I'd be concerned that we're going about it backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| That's just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Any other questions or comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Yes, I share some of the concerns of Councilman Smith and Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| I am going to vote for this, and it will, of course, require sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| I would only ask the developer to do whatever they can do to try to make this more harmonious, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3471)|
| 0:58:01| with the original vision that the planning department had in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| Just because something is not required doesn't mean that you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3487)|

| 1:01:02| Council Member Parker, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| Do we have anyone from the Leadership Foundation with us tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| Yes, Chris Martin, looks like he's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| I was curious about the fact that there were fewer applicants for assistance than anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3678)|
| 1:01:27| I wondered if you could speak a little bit more about that and why you think that might have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| Mr. Martin, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Chris Martin, 1433 Exeter Avenue, Mechanicsville, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921, Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3698)|
| 1:01:49| Yeah, so that is not our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| We had about 4,000 phone calls from March to December for assistance of all kinds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3712)|
| 1:02:01| So, we expended our $200,000 that we originally thought we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3721)|
| 1:02:08| The demand was very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| That demand is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| The moratorium on landlords to not evict is building up rents for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| So, we're seeing more and more people come in with higher need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| And so, the reason we're here is because we've blown through a lot of money in a very quick time because of the increased and incredible demand we've had on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3745)|
| 1:02:34| So, we didn't see a reduction in applications and submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| We were kind of overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| We were able to leverage this money with the Tennessee CARES Act money the governor offered and allowed us to use that, which paused for a couple of months in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3763)|
| 1:02:55| So, honestly, the C.B. money the city provided only provided, really, it was about six months' worth of clean that we didn't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3775)|
| 1:03:05| And so, that's why we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| It's just the calls don't stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| And it's been our Compassion Coalition staff team and our volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| We've had about 20 volunteers that have been case managing all these calls and staff case managing these calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| It's been a lot and a really heavy lift this last year, but we've risen to the occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| I have an unbelievable team working these calls and serving all kinds of people from all areas of town, but mainly urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3808)|
| 1:03:36| Our experience of what we're seeing is that the pandemic is having a really devastating impact on lower income families, mainly because a lot of those families are in the service industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3816)|
| 1:03:49| And they're losing jobs or hours are getting cut back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| And so, it's really having an impact there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| So, this is really needed funding, and we've asked for some additional funds, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| And, likely, we'll come back again for the new round of funding to continue to serve throughout the rest of the year because the need is going to get greater as we go, I'm afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3841)|
| 1:04:10| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| And thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| I'm glad I asked because I read it as you serviced 96 people, but you were hoping to service 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| And it sounds like the funds were used up servicing the 96, and that's the reason why you needed to send in another application to serve more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3862)|
| 1:04:32| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| I wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3873)|

| 1:05:48| I just think it's, if Director Cannon didn't mind, I reached out to him with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| And it is, you know, kind of just the usual information that is known, I think, among many council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3955)|
| 1:06:07| But I think it's good for our community to hear this each year so they understand when we invest this amount of money in a resurfacing program, how we determine how those programs carry out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3967)|

| 1:06:24| Yes, Council Member Parker, I'd be happy to expound upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering, City of Knoxville, City-County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| Straight up, I'll tell you that I'm amazed at how our staff goes through this and determines what streets should be paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=3994)|
| 1:06:40| As a general rule of thumb, we try to pave, make sure that streets are resurfaced once every 20 years, which is typically the design life of a given street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4000)|
| 1:06:52| For those that are more heavily traveled, that design life is yet a little less, which means that they'll have to be resurfaced more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4012)|
| 1:07:00| But we also take into account, frankly, input from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| While our staff is driving these roads on a very regular basis, and I don't think many people know that, they are looking to see the conditions of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4025)|
| 1:07:15| We also depend heavily on the public to give us feedback so that we can go out and look at specific areas and see if something is deteriorating much quicker than had been anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4035)|
| 1:07:27| We also coordinate this effort with Knoxville Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| We do not want to get caught, as folks have been caught in years past, where we do a great resurfacing job only to come around and have a utility trench cut the street wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4052)|
| 1:07:46| So, it's a great partnership with KUB, and it's worked well for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| We do our best to spread the number of miles that are resurfaced equally in each council district each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4072)|
| 1:08:00| We have also broken this contract into basically two phases, so as to open up the door to more diverse, smaller paving companies to have the chance to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4080)|
| 1:08:14| We've gotten good bids, and Rogers Group has served this city well in the past, and it would be our recommendation that for this particular phase that the contract be awarded to Rogers Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4094)|
| 1:08:26| Councilwoman Parker, I hope I touched on the things that you wanted me to touch on, but if I didn't, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| No, that's perfect. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| Thank you, Councilmember Parker. Thank you, Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Yeah, Director Cannon, I also wanted to point out, since you pointed out that your staff works around the schedule of KUB, which is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4122)|
| 1:08:52| For example, I had requests about repaving of streets in Holston Hills, and one section will be held off and coordinated with KUB because there's some pipe work that has to be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4132)|
| 1:09:03| But I think it's also specific to note that there are streets your staff identifies to make sure they get paved around events like Dogwood Arts, so that the streets aren't torn up during particular events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4143)|
| 1:09:16| So I appreciate that you guys work with the different organizations and activities and KUB to make sure that they happen in the most productive manner for everyone in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4156)|
| 1:09:30| Thank you so much, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4170)|

| 1:17:08| Councilmembers, there's several people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| The first...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Mayor...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Oh, yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| I'm sorry, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Before we hear from everybody, I just had an announcement on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| I discussed previously with the neighbors at St. Andrews that my law firm rents office space from the applicant's real estate company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4643)|
| 1:17:31| And so I had a question before we got started for Director Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| Director Swanson, given this, is there any conflict with me voting on this item tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| Mr. Roberto, you know we had a fairly detailed conversation about all the details associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| And based on that conversation, it's very clear to me that you do not have a legal conflict of interest in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| It would be appropriate for you to make full disclosure if you would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| But you do not have a legal conflict of interest that would prohibit you from voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| Seeing no conflict, it's my intention to vote on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Sorry for the disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| No, thanks for the disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| So now we'll go to Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Is it Nick Jackson is the first person who's signed up to speak on 12E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| Well, ma'am, the applicant didn't sign up with me to speak, but perhaps Mr. Forrester is on the call, so he may wish to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4698)|
| 1:18:28| And then we have a member of the public who also signed up to speak in favor before we got to those wishing to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4708)|
| 1:18:36| Oh, we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| One person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Okay, well, we can hear from the applicant and then we'll hear from, is it the one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Mr. Marlowe is the one person signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Let's hear from the applicant first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| He's on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| This is Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| I've been able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| And if you could start by stating your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919 on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4741)|
| 1:19:10| May I proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| The issue request is to rezone the property at 3800 East Walker Springs Road from office park zoning to an RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4753)|
| 1:19:23| We've been forthright since the beginning of this rezoning process that the intent and the purpose of the rezoning to RN-5 is for the development of a multifamily apartment dwelling development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4763)|
| 1:19:37| Throughout the process, my client has been open and upfront with the residents in the area, specifically the St. Andrews subdivision, which is adjacent to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4777)|
| 1:19:47| The meetings commenced in the summer of 2020, discussions with these residents, gaining insight, delivering what the proposed use for the property, the layout of the property would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4787)|
| 1:20:01| As far as the density, this is approximately 15 acres, and there will be no more than 216 dwelling units for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4801)|
| 1:20:11| As far as the rezoning goes, there's been a lot of commitment on behalf of the applicant here that you normally don't see on rezoning, such as the engagement of architects and engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4811)|
| 1:20:22| Renderings have been prepared, site layouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| There's been a traffic impact study that's been prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| There's been a lot of time and effort and money expensed on behalf of the property owner, the applicant on this, to move forward with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4829)|
| 1:20:40| The factors or the requirements for rezoning are satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| There is some question I've seen in regards to the staff report, in regards to substantial change or changing conditions for the area, that there was a reference that there was no significant change in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4845)|
| 1:20:58| I had conversations with Amy Brooks, and she brought up the fact in an agreement that one of these changing, substantial changing conditions is the recent addition of the CAT bus route 90 there on Gallaher View, which would be a change in condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4858)|
| 1:21:17| As well as additional changing conditions, substantial change conditions, are the changes in the real estate market and the demands in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4877)|
| 1:21:25| There is no denying that there is a high demand for available housing, and multi-family is a high demand in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4885)|
| 1:21:35| I can personally attest to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| I tried to find a three-bedroom apartment at the end of 2019, and it is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| That demand is not ceasing anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| All studies indicate, especially for this area, that the demand for housing will continue to exceed the availability of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4907)|
| 1:21:56| As far as some of the concerns, there has been a lot of concern or some concern from the St. Andrews subdivision about landscaping and the buffer and the greenway that bifurcates these two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4916)|
| 1:22:11| I can commit, and the property owner and developer have committed to not disturb, not develop anything on this north side of the greenway that is adjacent to that St. Andrews subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4931)|
| 1:22:22| So, any vegetation, any landscape buffer that currently exists there will remain undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| As for on the south side, the intent is to leave as much of that mature vegetation that is currently there as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4948)|
| 1:22:39| Although nothing can be guaranteed at this time, anything that would be compromised in that area would be replaced with a suitable and appropriate dense landscape screening to offer the buffer to these residents and participants that actually use the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4959)|
| 1:22:56| The intent is to have a cohesive and enabling development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| We want to continue to maintain these open lines of communication and promise to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| In discussions with the residents, the initial renderings reflected the buildings closer to the greenway and closer to St. Andrews, and there was some concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4987)|
| 1:23:19| So, then those were later moved towards the interstate side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| Again, that communication will continue, and we say that because under the current office park zoning, there are permitted uses that would require no input, would require no discussion with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5003)|
| 1:23:36| We could simply submit for a permit, and some of those uses are intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| You have half a minute left, Mr. Forster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| For instance, a hotel development there would be a much more aggressive, intense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| Not only that, the height would go up to 50 feet versus the R and 5 is 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| Non-pervious surface would be covered more with parking lot versus what we're proposing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| Again, I ask that you support this request and this rezoning, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| Thank you, Mr. Forster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Next person who signed up to speak in favor is our Bentley Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| Mr. Marlowe, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| Bentley Marlowe, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| Yes, can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| Yep, and please just state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921, over Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| I'm just expressing my support for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| Knoxville has a very strong need for housing, and this seems like the best use of this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5083)|
| 1:24:53| I believe it's far better and more preferred than hotels or any other sort of use that could go on it without the great lengths that the developer has gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5093)|
| 1:25:05| I just urge you all to be reasonable, and I think this is a very reasonable proposal that balances everybody's interest in the area with the city's need for more housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5105)|
| 1:25:19| That's all I have to say, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| Mayor, I didn't know if Mr. Forster had someone else to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| I think he might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Mr. Forster, I was unable to speak. Did you have someone else you wanted to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| We have some people available to answer potential questions that I may not be the best person to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| Understood. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Okay, we'll move on to the people signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Mr. Nick Jackson, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes to speak to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| My name is Nick Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| I live in St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Andrew's subdivision at 8270 Glen Ross Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| I'm a licensed professional engineer with a master's degree in engineering and an expert in water system design and hydraulics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| And I'm speaking on behalf of the board of the St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| Andrew's Homeowners Association and the residents of St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Andrew's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| I'll be submitting and writing my comments for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| We are opposed to the proposed rezoning from Office Park to RN-5 of the property adjacent to the St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| Andrew's subdivision, which is part of the West Hills neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| We're asking you to deny that requested rezoning to RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| Our three speakers will summarize the many reasons for our opposition, which is based on the specific language and required standards in the zoning ordinance regarding rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5204)|
| 1:26:53| We'll also provide some history of this neighborhood and a timeline of the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| We appreciated the opportunity to meet with many of you in our neighborhood where you saw the property and heard our many concerns about this possible rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5218)|
| 1:27:06| You've received many emails and phone calls about the matter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| We've made clear that we support the current Office Park zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| We fully understand that this property can be developed at any time under present zoning with a variety of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| But tonight, our focus is strictly on the issue of whether or not this property should be rezoned to RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| Our zoning ordinance in Article 16.1, Section E, sets out a very specific standards and conditions that must all be met in order to approve a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5247)|
| 1:27:37| The first standard states that evaluation of proposed MAP amendments must consider the appropriateness of the zoning district to the subject property and all the district's regulations and not for a specific development and or use of subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5257)|
| 1:27:51| The third standard states the following conditions must be met for all amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| As we'll discuss in more detail, these conditions are not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| A large apartment complex is simply not compatible or immediately adjacent to single family homes and therefore RN-5 is an inappropriate zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5281)|
| 1:28:11| The first condition is that the proposed amendment is necessary because of substantially changed or changing conditions in the area and districts affected or in the city generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5291)|
| 1:28:22| This condition cannot be met as nothing has changed in this area and I don't believe that bus routes were ever the intent of that code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5302)|
| 1:28:29| This property has always been vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| The single family houses in St. Andrews to the north were built between 1996 and 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5312)|
| 1:28:39| Almost all the West Hills single family homes behind St. Andrews are over 55 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| The Baptist Church to the east along with the West Hills Park have been there for many decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| The interstate is the southern border to the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| To the west is a very large Church of Christ, a ball field, and a large parking lot which has been there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| The planning staff's rezoning report in December 2020 states, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| there has been no recent significant changes in this area which would prompt a rezoning, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5343)|
| 1:29:10| Therefore, this mandatory condition has not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| The second condition is that the proposed amendment is consistent with the intent and purposes of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| Article 1.2 states nine purposes of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| The most relevant for this discussion are C, which states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| to divide the city into zoning districts according to the use of land and structures, bulk of structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| intensity of the use of the lot or other classification as deemed best suited to carry out the purposes of this code and adopted policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5371)|
| 1:29:39| D states to maintain and stabilize the value of structures, communities, and neighborhoods within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| As will be discussed, the many adverse effects of this rezoning establish that these purposes of the zoning code would not be satisfied by this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5386)|
| 1:29:55| and instead would have a very negative impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| The third condition is that the proposed amendment shall not adversely affect any other part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| Our next speaker's remarks will focus on those adverse effects and issues of great concern to the St. Andrews residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| And in conclusion, the mandatory requirements of the zoning ordinance for a rezoning have not been met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| and I ask that you please deny this rezoning from OP to RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| Thank you, Mr. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| The next person signed up to speak in opposition is John Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| Mr. Welsh, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Okay, Mr. Welsh, if you could just start by stating your name and address for the record, and then you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| My name is John Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| I live at 217 Rosset Lane, Knoxville, in St. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| I bought my first home in West Hills in 1985, and I've lived in St. Andrews since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| I'm here to directly address the zoning regulation standard related to adverse effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5459)|
| 1:31:06| And that standard reads, the proposed amendment shall not adversely affect any other part of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| It is our position, the position of six members of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| that there are way too many adverse effects to justify the zoning change from OP to RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| So what are the adverse effects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| The affected schools are already overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| West Hills Elementary is in temporary buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| Bearden Middle and Bearden High are full, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| Adding 210-plus apartments will clearly have an adverse effect on the already stressed schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5500)|
| 1:31:47| Traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| The traffic at Walbrook and East Walker Springs is dangerous now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| With 210 families plus visitors entering and exiting East Walker Springs 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5514)|
| 1:32:02| it will be made substantially worse without a significant investment by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| The G&T Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| This cherished and highly used greenway will be negatively affected by the loss of green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| For the proposed apartments to be feasible, they have to squeeze in 210-plus apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| This, combined with the natural gas, greenway, and road easements, plus the detention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| reduces the 14 acres to approximately 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| and greatly limits their ability to put more than a minimal landscape green space and buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5550)|
| 1:32:37| Proximity to single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| The large apartment building and 300 parking spaces will literally be right on top of the homes on Glen Ross Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| There will be only a minimal buffer between those single-family homes and apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| There is a much lower activity level with offices compared to a large apartment development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| particularly on nights and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| It is inconceivable that this rezoning will not have an adverse impact on home values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| and our neighborhood's quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| Flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| This property is on 10 Mile Creek that backs up to St. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| Every year in the 17 years that I've lived here, we've had serious flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| Nick Jackson, who you just heard, has shared pictures with you from the most recent big flood from last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| and that really wasn't that big a rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| So we're very concerned about the additional flooding caused by water coming from the nine apartment buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| and large parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| The city already knows that we're under old stormwater codes that do not meet current standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| and they have not, in the 17 years that I've lived there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| upgraded them in a way that actually remediated our situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| The city engineers state that they will make the development meet current codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| but most of the existing flooding problem is caused by water coming from outside of St. Andrews property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| particularly through the West Hills Park and under Winston Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| A big apartment complex with huge parking lots built on top of a steep hill above a flood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| is literally a recipe for disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| And the people who will continue to suffer are the families of St. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| All the risks of this rezoning is on the residents of St. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| So in summary, it's our position that the proposed rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| allowing a much higher density housing in a compressed space on a steep hill connected to a flood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| and adjacent to an established single-family neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| is clearly going to have numerous adverse effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| Then you throw in the adverse impact on crowded schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| heavily trafficked roads, and the highly used Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| and rezoning to R and 5 is not appropriate for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| Bottom line, the zonings and ordinances required standards and conditions for rezoning have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5691)|
| 1:34:58| We ask that you deny this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5701)|
| 1:35:10| Mayor, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| The third and final person who signed up to speak in opposition to this is Ms. Debbie Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| Ms. Jennings, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Okay, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| Thank you, Mayor, and good evening, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| My name is Debbie Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| I've lived in the St. Andrews subdivision at 219 Kirkwall Lane for the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| I currently serve as the president of our homeowners association, the SAHOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| I will be submitting and writing my comments for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| Late in July 2020, I learned secondhand from our neighbors in the West Hills Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| that Oliver Smith had met with them regarding a parcel of land that he planned to sell to Kentucky investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| to build an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| He did not meet with those of us who lived in St. Andrews until September 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| even though he knows several residents and board members, as he originally developed the subdivision beginning in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| The 14-plus acres of land in question directly abuts the length of the St. Andrews subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| along our main road, Glen Ross Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| As you may have heard in great detail, the proposed rezoning to R and 5 would have a direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| and immediate adverse effect on our 57 homeowners, especially the 17 neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| whose backyards are in the extremely close proximity to the vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| Several families have indicated that reluctantly they may decide to move if this rezoning is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5797)|
| 1:36:44| Our St. Andrews board met with Mr. Smith on September 30th, as I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| He showed us options for both apartments and offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| He said he didn't know what he was going to do yet with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| Our board expressed many concerns about both options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| After letting our homeowners know about the meeting and getting their input, on October 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| I sent an email to Mr. Smith with a recap of the September 30th meeting, as he requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| along with the additional concerns from our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| Despite trying to openly communicate, St. Andrews received no notice from Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| regarding his October 26th application for rezoning to R and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| We knew nothing about the rezoning plans until late November when we received postcards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| from the Planning Commission notifying us of the December 10th Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| to consider the rezoning to R and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| This parcel of land, originally known as Lot 61 of the St. Andrews subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| was rezoned to office in 2005 at Mr. Smith's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| The rezoning to office received the approval of over 90% of the St. Andrews residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| and the approval of the West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| In 2004 and 2005, Mr. Smith told the St. Andrews Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| that apartments would not be a good fit adjacent to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| nor in the best interest of the St. Andrews residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| He presented us with a concept plan for an office park, the office of the St. Andrews LOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| St. Andrews residents made a deal in good faith with Mr. Smith, relying on his statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| that apartments would never be allowed to be built on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| And our residents had a reasonable expectation that his promise would be kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| This message was always communicated to new property owners as they moved in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| and for 16-plus years, nothing has been built on this forested land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| The current plan is supposedly for 216 apartments in nine buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| with very little space for a landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| Nothing we have been told or shown by Mr. Smith would be binding on the new owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| and their developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Once rezoned, there would be no further public meetings on the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| Article 1.2 of the zoning code states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| the purpose of this code is to D, maintain and stabilize the value of structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| communities, and neighborhoods within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| If approved, this rezoning would go against the state of purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| and would destabilize the values of the properties in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| This drastic rezoning from O.P. to R.N. 5 would send a message to all residents of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| that they can no longer rely on the city's zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| very clear mandatory standards and conditions to protect the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| and integrity of their neighborhood and their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| That is a scary prospect for St. Andrews homeowners and for all Knoxville homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| whose largest asset and biggest investment is their home and property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| St. Andrews and West Hills neighbors oppose this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| Almost 2,500 signatures on our change.org position support our position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| that R.N. 5 is not appropriate for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| It was not appropriate in 2005. It is not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| A large apartment complex is not compatible or immediately adjacent singlet family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| I want to thank the seven members of council who visited the St. Andrews neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| You walked the greenway with us and saw the proximity of potential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| the existing properties in the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| Thank you for listening and hearing all of our concerns about the adverse effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| that rezoning would have on St. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| I respectfully request that you vote no to this rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| and leave this property zoned as office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| I thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| Thank you, Ms. Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| That concludes the people who signed up to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| Council members, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| I want to start off by thanking the neighborhood and the developer for meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| Most recently they met, which caused us to have a delay on January 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| And so council's always been of the nature to try to encourage everyone to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6049)|
| 1:40:56| and have discussions, and so I appreciate that they went forward with those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| I just want to take a moment and thank my colleagues on council for spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| time with the neighborhood and walking the greenway and having discussions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| the developer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| I truly appreciate your time and attention to this important matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| And just want to recognize the good faith efforts that everyone had in moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| forward on this particular agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| I have a couple questions for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Director Brooks, you heard in some of the discussions already the issue about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6090)|
| 1:41:40| the conditions for a rezoning under Article 16.1 E3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| Can you talk to us about the substantial change or changes in the report that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| was issued by planning staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| Yes, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| That was an error on staff's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| It happens from time to time, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| But the recent change in the area should have included the addition of the CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| bus route along North Gallaher View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| That began in January of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| And this change is significant because one of the primary location criteria that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| staff uses for medium-density residential is the proximity to corridors that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| served or proposed to be served by transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| This area is well served by transit options, including bus transit, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| greenways, as well as interstate access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| So it's one of the criteria that we look to when we're assessing whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| medium-density residential makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| And is the bus stop change, is that something that has been referenced in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6167)|
| 1:42:54| previous matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| Again, so when we're looking at specifically for medium or high-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| residential, that is one thing that we will look for is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| is there currently access to a transit route or is there one currently planned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| I've spent a good amount of time with the neighbors and obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| walking the area and discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| And we've discussed very thoroughly the heights of the buildings that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| already heard about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| We've talked about the different uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| which you've already heard about in today's discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| And we discussed some of the overtures about addressing some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| In the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| the neighbors are comfortable with all the uses that are available in Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| Park now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| And that's, as you heard from some of the previous statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| they agreed to that years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| That's what they were expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| So given the neighbor's preference as the use in Office Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| rather than changing to RN-5, I cannot support this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| Thank you, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| So I first want to say, I can't speak for all of my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| but I know that this issue has created a great deal of heartburn for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| I know myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| I know a number of people who live in St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| Andrews, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| have visited and really tried to look at this issue from every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| there are a number of things that I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| and there are still some concerns that, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| one thing I'll say as far as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| housing and family housing, I mean, first of all, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| roughly 52% of our city residents are renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| And with that, you know, that includes young professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| it includes first responders, it includes teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| And to be able to provide multifamily housing in different parts of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| town to meet the growing need. And we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| we have an incredible need for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| And there are a lot of multifamily that does exist near and next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| single family residences. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| also from a development standpoint, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| I think when a developer is willing and wants to be judicious and a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| steward of their property to work with neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| to listen to concerns and to really work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| to modify based on the input. I think that's a real gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| Because not every developer is willing to do that. And to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| to actually spend the time, the due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| the financial commitment that's gone into this prior to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| And, you know, our in five, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| it's also stated as a functional transitional area between single,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6372)|
| 1:46:18| single family homes and office park theoretically is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| And, you know, my concern is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| with this and it stays office park, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| it can be a hotel, it can be sub parceled out for multi-uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| which is going to create a great deal more of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| concrete jungle, if you will, with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| not as much as the consistency that I feel like is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| is being offered in this project. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| and I've looked and I've tried to do some studies about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| you know, property values and schools and traffics and safety. And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| a lot of those studies that I've read have really countered all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| And that property values don't, don't decline. In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| they can, they potentially increase, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| but I've heard all those concerns. I would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| I know the water issue, I mean, that is concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| I would like to call on director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| I've talked to him about this issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| And I know that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| Smith is, is also concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| I think wants to try and resolve this longstanding issue that has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| has been there. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| are there some solutions and resolutions should this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| move forward that can be addressed to better the quality of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6466)|
| 1:47:52| of this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| address the water issues because it definitely there's no doubt that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| need to remedy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| Mr. Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| can you speak to council member testaments questions, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| Yes, mayor, Harold Cannon, director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| city of Knoxville department of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| Let me qualify what I'm about to say, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| by noting that no site development plan has been submitted to our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| for approval. There has not been a drainage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| And so because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| my comments have to be general in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| but also there's a historic factor that may or may not be of help to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| The,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| the detention facilities for St. Andrews were developed back in 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| At that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| our detention requirements are significantly less than what we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| And I believe Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Jackson who spoke earlier would agree that all of us have learned as time's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| gone on due to different flooding and the capacity of the city to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| And so I think it's important that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6536)|

| 1:49:42| in terms of how things are going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| The first thing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| what we will require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| by ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| must provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| or ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| that will retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| the 100-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| 100-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| required in the Ten Mile Drainage Basin. However, also by ordinance, we have the authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| require an additional level of attention being given to the storm system. And that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6605)|
| 1:50:12| the historical part comes in. And I appreciate everyone's patience with me for just a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| more minutes. There was a drainage plan submitted for this site for an office park. And at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6617)|
| 1:50:25| time, our staff noted the concerns about the drainage. And we discussed that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| would have to be more attention given than just the retention component. It was at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| time that the development took the step to start looking at a groundwater injection well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6637)|
| 1:50:45| where in essence, any runoff would be either retained or injected back into the groundwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| table, which was an extra level of protection for those folks impacted by flooding in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| area. That approach was approved. It did not develop out, which is why we're here today. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6657)|
| 1:51:05| I am aware that the tests did take place and that the particular area that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| proposing an injection well did test out positive, that it could be used for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| purpose. Again, I'll go back to my opening statement. We don't know what's being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6675)|
| 1:51:22| here. We do not have any kind of drainage plan. Councilwoman Testerman, my hope is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| I'm paying a picture for whenever we receive a development plan, whether it is office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| whether it's apartments, whatever that plan is, is that not only will we be imposing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6696)|
| 1:51:43| retention yardstick to this, but we will be imposing another measure of attention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6703)|
| 1:51:50| whoever the developer is will have to give to the drainage situation in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6710)|
| 1:51:57| Thank you. And just to conclude on that, I realize that nothing has been submitted, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6717)|
| 1:52:07| think with anything, you know, it can't be submitted until, you know, what the path forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| is. But I know that Mr. Smith has submitted, I think, an ancillary agreement stating, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6734)|
| 1:52:21| one of the concerns that I heard consistently was he can just sell it off and then wash his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| hands and walk away and the plan can change. The one thing I would say to that is, you know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6748)|
| 1:52:35| don't know that people generally spend, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars to get this far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6755)|
| 1:52:42| and then, you know, scrap an idea. And I think that agreement keeps Mr. Smith involved from start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6762)|
| 1:52:49| to finish to ensure the quality of the project, to ensure the integrity of the area of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6769)|
| 1:52:58| neighborhood, of the development, to ensure that, you know, this project, again, meets the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6778)|
| 1:53:06| standards, I think, that we all hoped that it would. You know, it's difficult, you know, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6786)|
| 1:53:14| again, with the housing needs, with the fact that I think this project keeps it more consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| R and 5, opposed to sub-parceling it out and, you know, having a five-story hotel or a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6799)|
| 1:53:29| broader, you know, concrete situation. That, for those reasons, is why I'm choosing to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6809)|
| 1:53:41| Thank you, Ms. Testerman. Any other questions or comments from council members? Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| Thank you. We've had a lot of conversations with a lot of community members, and I appreciate all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6827)|
| 1:53:54| communication, the email, and I know this is really a difficult topic, but change does happen. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6834)|
| 1:54:01| remember, I went to Bearden High School, lived near Bearden Middle School, and used to walk through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| woods that are now St. Andrews. I appreciate that the greenway that was put there is also, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6846)|
| 1:54:15| donated by the developer to be there. And with the work that we did with RECODE, it seems like this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6855)|
| 1:54:23| exactly what we were working for. Density in a space where there'll be transportation, people can walk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6863)|
| 1:54:30| jobs, and I think, overall, it will be an asset to the West Hills community. That's it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6870)|
| 1:54:39| Thank you, Council Member Singh. Any other questions or comments? Council Member Smith and Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Yeah, I too spent some time with the neighbors, talked with a lot of people, walked up in the woods. Maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| shouldn't have, but we're on live video, so it's okay. We walked up in the woods. I maybe walked in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6892)|
| 1:54:59| backyards to see what the view was like from the neighbors, and I think Mr. Welsh did a good job of framing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| some of the risks associated with this development. I think the traffic issue is real, but I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6905)|
| 1:55:15| the applicant has provided a solution for that, or at least funding for it. I do think that the greenway is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6915)|
| 1:55:24| special. I love outdoor green spaces, but this is proper property that was afforded by the applicant, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6924)|
| 1:55:34| current zoning of office provides opportunity for more mass structure than this R and 5, and while I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6934)|
| 1:55:45| understand the desire by the neighborhood to keep it as it is, I do think planning staff wisely recommended the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| change from R and 6 to R and 5 as part of this consideration. I think the crux of the matter, I think the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6951)|
| 1:55:59| difference between the current zoning and R and 5 that would have a potential adverse risk is population density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6959)|
| 1:56:08| and I think, similar to Councilperson Singh's comments, I think that it could be a good contribution to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6968)|
| 1:56:17| community as well, and I do think that the greenway will be maintained. I believe the applicant submitted a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6977)|
| 1:56:24| guarantee that some landscape buffer would have to be approved, so I know that there's been concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6984)|
| 1:56:34| changes and promises made by the applicant in the past, but as I understand it, the sale of the property now has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=6994)|
| 1:56:41| some guarantees associated with it that would retain some of that landscape buffer that's not promised by future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7001)|
| 1:56:50| zoning or current zoning, and so I think it's important. I think the applicant's reputation is on the line to do this well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7010)|
| 1:56:59| so I think there's incentive in that as well, so I'll stay on top of this as well, but I plan to support the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7019)|
| 1:57:06| Thank you, Councilmember Smith. Any other comments or questions? Oh, was it Ms. Reiter? Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7026)|
| 1:57:13| Yeah. This is really a difficult situation where a lot of people feel that, you know, we know that we need more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7033)|
| 1:57:27| but I also feel that we have a particular issue here that's been ignored for about two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| These people in this neighborhood, some of them have been there a long time, and some of them have been there a shorter period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7053)|
| 1:57:40| They've been asking for recreation for a long time with the flooding, and I, you know, I went and walked the greenway with them. I walked the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7060)|
| 1:57:50| There's gullies of erosion through there. There's been concrete poured into the creek bed to keep it from eroding from all the water that's coming from not on Mr. Smith's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7070)|
| 1:58:04| from even upstream from that, so it's not just the water that's on Mr. Smith's property. It's the water coming from the road above and the park above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7084)|
| 1:58:15| to the point where the houses there along the retention ponds have stains. They have mud stains on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7095)|
| 1:58:25| So, if you wanted to sell your house, you would have to get a pressure washer and clean it off in between the flood incidences, which are multiple times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7105)|
| 1:58:33| and we all know that our rain events have become more frequent and more common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| Their garages, their basements, their crawl spaces get flooded. There's a lot for sale in the neighborhood that stays underwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7118)|
| 1:58:46| They've had previous council members come out there, previous engineering directors come out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7126)|
| 1:58:52| and so what we're looking at is an op, what Mr. Smith said to me, is that if this doesn't go through, he would parcel it out and do smaller developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7132)|
| 1:59:03| And I have to question whether this full parcel is appropriate to develop, and they've never been able to get any kind of agreement or assistance in trying to deal with the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7143)|
| 1:59:17| And the detention ponds or retention ponds, I don't want to state which ones they are, are on the parcels to be sold, not on the parcels that belong to the houses that are being flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7157)|
| 1:59:28| I realize Mr. Smith, and I'm not questioning his word, is saying that he'll stick with it through the project, but the problem is, is that there's nothing binding that makes him do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7168)|
| 1:59:37| So, I have great difficulty saying to these homeowners who deal with this flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7177)|
| 1:59:44| just believe in the process and it's going to work out for you. I know it didn't work out for you the last two decades, but this time it's going to, if you just let it get developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7184)|
| 1:59:54| And so I have, I just can't support it on that promise and notion and hope that it's going to work out for them. So that's why I'm going to be not voting in favor of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7194)|
| 2:00:07| Thank you. I will add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| Just 1 more thing. The other thing is, I appreciate the traffic study and the comment that Mr. Smith is willing to pay for a traffic light over on Walker Springs or Gallaher, whichever it is over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7211)|
| 2:00:24| As you leave towards the Sam's club, I left there on a Sunday and it took a while to get out because the amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7224)|
| 2:00:33| That's there, and I asked director cannon if a traffic light had been approved there and the answer was no, because there are plans. And so that hasn't been through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7233)|
| 2:00:43| But I would make a guess that you wouldn't put a traffic light that close to the exit ramp, because we have a traffic light, not that close to an exit ramp over a Miller town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7243)|
| 2:00:54| And it causes backing up into the exit ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| Which now has commitment to fix that because we had a death on the ramp during due to the traffic backed up. So, between that and the flooding, I question whether all property should be maxed out with development and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7257)|
| 2:01:12| I'm not able to support this particular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| Thank you council member writer council member Thomas and then we'll come back to the council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| Yes, thank you. May I had a question for miss Brooks miss Brooks. We had talked earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7281)|
| 2:01:28| Today, and we were just kind of exploring possibilities of talking about lower density zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7288)|
| 2:01:36| I realize that it's already in 5, that's before us, but could you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| Kind of refresh us generally on lower densities of both of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| With housing in 4 and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| Sure, I'm happy to do that. So, um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| For there are a couple other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| For medium density residential that would fall into this land use classification and that would be our in 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7320)|
| 2:02:08| Or are in 4 again, they wouldn't be able to get the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| The number of units, I think that they were requesting, but there are a couple of a couple of additional options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7333)|
| 2:02:21| And basically what is our in 4 and then I believe are in 3, maybe townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| Yes, so are in in are in 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| It's a townhouse and multifamily dwellings are permitted as well as single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| But there are some more restrictions associated with the are in 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| So, there are permittees to 1 or more townhouse buildings on a lot that total more than 8 dwellings are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7361)|
| 2:02:49| And multifamily development developments have no more than 4 dwelling units within 1 multifamily structure and no more than a total of 8 units per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7369)|
| 2:02:57| So, this would this type of a development would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| Would change how on this lot, they would probably have to subdivide in order to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| Utilize the are in 4 and then they do are in 4, you can go higher density than that, and it comes in as a special use to the planning commission and are in 3 is primarily single family to family and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7387)|
| 2:03:22| And try plexus or townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| Yeah, my concern is the density we need more housing in lots of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| In lots of ways, this is a good place for it, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| I'm concerned about essentially maxing out the amount of density and I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| I realize that this is not before us these zonings, but I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| I'm wondering if are in 3 or are in 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| Particularly are in 3, maybe actually more appropriate for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| Those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| People can come in if they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7442)|
| 2:04:02| Council member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| Council member Smith, I was going to go to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| I don't know if anyone wanted to respond to council member Thomas's observation before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| We move on, maybe we'll think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| Council member Smith, you can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| Yeah, I have a couple of follow up questions for director Ken and I think council member rider brings up some good questions are good concerns around flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7458)|
| 2:04:25| That's a legitimate concern real people's houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| Significant impact, so that basin seems to be a problem that's not been dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7470)|
| 2:04:36| So director Ken and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| Whose responsibility is it from the city's perspective to maintain that basin in its current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7480)|
| 2:04:48| Situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| The way this is set up right now, my understanding is, is that the homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| Is responsible for the maintenance of that basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| I will tell you that I understand that the document that establishes that is somewhat complicated, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7504)|
| 2:05:13| Our understanding is, is that the homeowners association is responsible for that, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| consistent with most attention or retention facilities throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7518)|
| 2:05:25| Thank you, I have 1 follow up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| It's still a problem, no matter whose responsibility it is, it still has a real impact on people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7528)|
| 2:05:34| In terms of the current zoning office compared to our in 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7534)|
| 2:05:40| How would you all look through look at this through engineering permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7540)|
| 2:05:46| Differently from a runoff water control perspective, meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| If there were offices, according to the current zoning built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| And they came before you, I think, as they have in the past for permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| How would you look at water runoff different than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| In theory, they might come before you soon with our in 5 development for runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7567)|
| 2:06:15| Councilman our yardstick will basically be the same under either scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| And that is, they have to show us what the pre developed runoff conditions were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| For the 100 year event, and however much of that is developed, they have to show us what the post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7586)|
| 2:06:33| Development runoff will be for that same event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| That must be stored again, forgive my analogy, but that has to be stored in the bathtub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| And the drain cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| I'm sorry, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| So, just to be clear, they built a hotel according to the office zone that's allowed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| The water runoff issue will be of the same review consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7613)|
| 2:07:00| By engineering, as if apartments were used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| As part of our in 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7626)|
| 2:07:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7626)|
| 2:07:06| And also, I would remind Council that when this did come before us before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| We did use the authority and the ordinance to require an additional level of attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7633)|
| 2:07:20| Be given to this area, which is when the groundwater injection well was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| Okay, thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| I just want to reiterate my perspective on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| There are changes that will happen regardless of whether this is rezoned or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| The way that I've considered it and talking with a lot of neighbors and with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7655)|
| 2:07:41| Is what the different with the incremental effect is from the rezoning and so that's why I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| supporting it because I don't think there's any more or less damage from the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| I don't think the density in terms of population, the risk associated with that outweighs the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| city's holistic needs for additional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| So, that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| Any other comments or questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7686)|
| 2:08:12| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7692)|
| 2:08:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| So, my concern is the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| It was the HOA's responsibility on the detention pond in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7698)|
| 2:08:25| Is that something that the city can assist with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| Because it's obviously a problem that does need to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| And as Council Member Smith noted, no matter what gets built there, this is going to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7712)|
| 2:08:40| So, I think to Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| Mr. Cannon, can you speak to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| There's a limit as to how we can assist, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| And what I mean by that is that a plan would need to be brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7734)|
| 2:09:00| Now, we can enforce maintenance of it, those type of components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| And the complicating factor is just how old this facility is going back to 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| So, it was built under much less restrictive restrictions than what we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7752)|
| 2:09:19| And I mean significantly less restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| It was the best everybody knew at the time, but we've learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| So, they would need to, they would be responsible for bringing a plan to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7767)|
| 2:09:33| having an engineer develop a plan to hopefully correct this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7773)|
| 2:09:38| I will tell you, and this is where it gets a little complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| That any change to that detention facility of any magnitude may kick that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7782)|
| 2:09:52| into today's ordinances to where it becomes a retention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7792)|
| 2:09:57| And to where if it is modified, it may not be possible to leave it in its current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| Because there is what I will call the equivalent of a blue line string| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| flowing through the middle of it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| We would not allow that pond to be constructed where it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| So, it's, I know you're hearing this word complicated from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| and I will tell you it is complicated on a number of fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7819)|
| 2:10:28| But it sounds like this is something that needs to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| Just as is if the houses are flooding now, and if in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| you know, whatever is built on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| Councilwoman, I can't disagree with you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| I agree 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| But this is a matter that the neighborhood or someone would have to initiate and bring to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| city, just as we have in other communities throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| So, Mr. Cannon, question for you as it relates to the basin and the runoff water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7864)|
| 2:11:11| So, we're talking about something that's 27 years old at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| So, anything, I think what I'm hearing is anything that additional that is built in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7875)|
| 2:11:22| is going to contribute to additional runoff water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| Anything that's built in that area, they will, let's say, an adjoining parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| At least within the boundaries of a 100-year event, they will have to hold that water back in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7894)|
| 2:11:42| And they will have to do it on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| And unless they want to get into a complete reworking of the existing detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7905)|
| 2:11:51| it cannot happen there because of the way our existing ordinances are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| So, they will be holding back whatever runoff they would have been generating up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| what a 100-year event would be causing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| But as of right now, there are no plans that we see as relates to that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7927)|
| 2:12:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| As far as the apartment development, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| The only thing we have seen was a few years ago related to the office development, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| And so, in those plans, would we require them to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| make any type of adjustments or anything that they need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| to make sure that that water is held back from the basin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7951)|
| 2:12:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7956)|
| 2:12:36| And that will be the city's responsibility codes, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| That will be our, the Department of Engineering's responsibility will be to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| any and all stormwater calculations and proposed improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| And the current flooding issue, if I think, I think if I, if I follow this conversation correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7970)|
| 2:12:56| that is now on the, that is now the responsibility of the Homeowners Association, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| And again, please forgive me for saying it may be a little complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| There's some legal questions in there that I believe even the Homeowners Association has brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7987)|
| 2:13:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| Can I ask Mr. Jackson from the neighborhood to comment on their past experiences with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8003)|
| 2:13:31| the retention ponds and the flooding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| Mr. Jackson, are you still on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| You could speak to Council Member Ryder's question about retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| Thanks, Mayor and Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| Yeah, so I would say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8026)|
| 2:13:52| Oliver Smith owns the detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| That's in KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| Everybody agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| I would ask Mr. Cannon to review the City of Knoxville's own documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| because the City of Knoxville sent Oliver Smith a letter this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8043)|
| 2:14:08| demanding that he maintain his pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| Now, we have had a long dispute about this document that he claims he signed himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8052)|
| 2:14:19| and then the only signature on it was he to himself when he was the sole member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| That has nothing to do with this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| We haven't brought it up because it's a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| But this document that Harold is mentioning, supposedly, in Oliver's mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8069)|
| 2:14:36| gave us maintenance of his property up until the time that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| developed the offices at St. Andrews, and then it goes back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| And that's been a long-standing dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| But I would, again, ask why did the City send a letter to Oliver Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| saying that he needs to maintain that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| It wasn't even six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| So clearly, we aren't in control of that and have not maintained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8099)|
| 2:15:09| And the other side I would also mention is that the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8109)|
| 2:15:15| does it need to be maintained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| The flooding has nothing to do with maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| That's just an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Anybody that says that hasn't looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| I would stake my professional engineering license upon it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| because the guy that's at the end of that ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| that lives immediately there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| has been clearing that whole space for the last 15 years himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8132)|
| 2:15:38| And so he makes sure that no brush that comes from the ditch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| will then cause the pipe and the culvert to block up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| and make flooding conditions worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| And so it does need to be maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| but that is not the cause of the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| if anybody's saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| The downstream pipe is the cause of the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| So there's a pipe that goes under the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| and under the road downstream of the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| The ditch is undersized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| Woefully, as Mr. Cannon said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| I would say on a factor of 300%, probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| if I'm just pulling numbers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| And then the downstream pipe is also the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| But what I want to point out is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| you know, under the current code, it is more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| But the current code, as he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| only requires a 100-year storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| So what council needs to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| and this does get technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| but anything beyond a 100-year storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| absolutely causes more flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| There's no one in their right mind can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| that that's not the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8201)|
| 2:16:42| because the code only requires up to a 100-year storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| So to ignore that in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| that's already flooding and bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| is, you know, is throwing gasoline into a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| And we do see more storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| We all know that rainfall is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| It's, you know, it's hard to argue against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| So that's been going on for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| And the last thing I would say is that 90% of the flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| and I'm talking about just a two-year design storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| I calculated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| There's many ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| Mine was, you know, one of the simpler ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| So you could get an engineer to do a more complex calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| The number might be slightly different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| but it's not going to be materially different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| There's 4,500 gallons a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| flowing through that ditch in a two-year storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| 4,500 gallons a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| and 90% of that comes from outside St. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| Now that number might, you know, vary by 10, 15, 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| but that is a massive amount of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| and that's only a two-year storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| So to ignore or say we expect the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| that originally developed this and was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| the entire time from start to finish in St. Andrews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| is now promising he's going to fix it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| when he stated to us on September 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| that's on record, we've got it recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| that he would sell the property once it was rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| and be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| I mean, I don't understand how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| people are saying he's going to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| if he sells the property, how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| How would he guarantee anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| There's nothing binding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| There's nothing required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| I just think that this has just been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| for a long time unchecked and unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| Sounds to me like we kind of have two issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| separate issues that are actually converging right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| There's the overall flooding issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| but we also have a property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| who has a right to develop his property as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| regardless, and that he would have to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| with the current flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| I mean, the current ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| that would deal with the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| Is that what I'm hearing, Mr. Kennedy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| We've got two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| There is a flooding problem in St. Andrew's neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| which separate and apart from this proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| has been ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| What I'm hearing is that one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8370)|
| 2:19:35| about the negative impact of rezoning would be flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8375)|
| 2:19:41| but if it's rezoned or not rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| he has a right to develop the property anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| and will be subject to doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| to make sure that runoff does not go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8394)|
| 2:19:59| into the St. Andrew's already flooded areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| Is that generally what I'm getting here, Mr. Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8403)|
| 2:20:10| Mr. Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8410)|
| 2:20:11| Yes, ma'am, that's a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| Okay, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| because I think two issues are kind of getting muddied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| and there is the flooding issue, no doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| but this is talking about rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| from office to apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| and I hear that the zone will not change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| the requirements placed upon the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8430)|
| 2:20:35| for maintaining his floodwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| The next question I have is about the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| So, I heard Ms. Ryder say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| that we might not put a traffic light there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| because you back up onto the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8447)|
| 2:20:50| If my memory serves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| that Walker Springs exit is a very long exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| that actually doesn't go right back on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| So, is there a possibility for a street light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| or a traffic light at this intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| Mr. Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| Councilwoman, there is that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| Basically, the developer has gone through the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| and to determine whether a signal would be warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| or is it appropriate at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| based upon traffic volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| And my understanding is a report has been submitted to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8494)|
| 2:21:39| a study has been submitted to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8499)|
| 2:21:40| and it appears those warrants are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| So, that box can be checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| Well, I could do that without the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| because I'm out there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| And yes, there is lots of traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| So, then the question is whether a signal can go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| without being a detriment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| to the other traffic movements in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| That information has not been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| That would be the next step of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| The cautions or concerns about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| we don't disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| But we would give them the opportunity to show us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| how that would work if installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| and how they would install it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| We'll go to Council Member Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| and then to Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| Yes, another question for Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| And this is a layperson's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| about stormwater engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8558)|
| 2:22:41| But the detention pond that would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| on this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| would it only be able to be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| in a particular spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| What I'm trying to do is figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| how did the design of a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| would be affected by where you had to put a detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8582)|
| 2:23:09| Can you speak generally to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| The location it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| I want to reemphasize this is a retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| Under detention conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| you're going to let some flow out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| Didn't mean to be picky, forgive me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| but I just want to make sure that we're on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| Yes, it does affect the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| And that was one of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| on the office development is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| originally at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| it didn't appear that enough area had been set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| So the development will have to set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| appropriate area to address the volume of storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| that will be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| to store this difference between the two events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| And it does, it gets more challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| particularly on the size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| trying to squeeze that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| But it has to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8653)|
| 2:24:20| Council Member Smith, could you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| Your microphone sort of messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8664)|
| 2:24:34| I'll try without my video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8675)|
| 2:24:35| Yeah, now we got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| Sorry, my connection is poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| It was my understanding that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| the applicant submitted something to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| that did include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8684)|
| 2:24:48| some language related to binding the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| particularly the landscape buffer changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| to the sale of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| Is Mr., the applicant or Mr. Forrester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| available to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| Mr. Forrester, are you still on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| Yes, I'm still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| Did you hear Council Member Smith's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| Could you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| An ancillary agreement was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| Okay, Mr. Forrester, I think he's letting you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| An ancillary agreement was submitted on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| between the current property owner representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| Mr. Oliver Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| and the proposed developer, Mr. John Davenport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8733)|
| 2:25:37| dealing with the binding requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| of Mr. Smith having to meet the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8739)|
| 2:25:45| I guess, approve any and all development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| landscape plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| stormwater plans, grading plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| anything that would be required to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| to plans review and inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8757)|
| 2:25:58| as well as City Engineering Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8758)|
| 2:26:03| And that will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| Yeah, Mr. Smith, do you have any more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| for Mr. Forrester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8770)|
| 2:26:14| Council Member Ryder or Mr...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| Yeah, we'll come back to Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8777)|
| 2:26:18| if you have more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| Go ahead, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| Yeah, I just wanted to ask Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8781)|
| 2:26:22| I know we received the ancillary agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| in our email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8785)|
| 2:26:25| Who else was it provided to in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8785)|
| 2:26:33| You're asking Mr. Forrester who received...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| Mr. Forrester or Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| I think that's a question for Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| Mr. Forrester, are you still on the call, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| To whom did you send the ancillary agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8805)|
| 2:26:52| Mayor, he's unmuted, but he's not responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| Yes, Mr. Smith submitted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| to all the city council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| and I don't know that he officially requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| that be incorporated into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| but I do believe that'd be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| To add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| So it wasn't provided to the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| Any other questions, comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| or things you wish to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Yes, just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| the email that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8850)|
| 2:27:34| that Ms. Ryder was addressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| I did provide that just for informational purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| to the at least one liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| with the neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| but it was at a very late date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| It was like maybe an hour before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| So I don't know other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| one particular person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8873)|
| 2:27:54| I don't know if anybody saw that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| And I did it just for informational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| I didn't know whether or not they'd received it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| So, and I thought it was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| that they look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8890)|
| 2:28:11| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8891)|
| 2:28:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| Still on the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| The injection system that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| is talking about using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| is that something that could actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| relieve the flooding conditions to St. Andrews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8907)|
| 2:28:32| if it was done properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| And I guess to Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8916)|
| 2:28:37| Yeah. Mr. Cannon, could you speak to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| Council Member Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8920)|
| 2:28:45| there is that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| I would offer that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| I don't want to confuse you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| and I'm afraid I've done a master's job of that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| The groundwater injection well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| was proposed under an office plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| We have not seen what is being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| as part of the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| That's not unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| simply because they wanted to get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| this rezoning part first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| But there is, depending on how they do the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| there is the possibility they could reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| the amount of runoff leaving this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| even with the retention conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| They could actually choose to hold back more water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8965)|
| 2:29:28| than what might generally be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| and take even more advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| of a groundwater injection well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| Okay. Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| Council Member Thomas, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8990)|
| 2:29:51| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| We've all really worked hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| This is obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| The applicant, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| had been really forthcoming, at least with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| I can't speak for everyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| and answered all my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| I was impressed somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| with his amount of work he was doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| trying to get something to fit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| At the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| went out and talked to the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| completely sincere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9020)|
| 2:30:22| and willing to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| So this has been a difficult one for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| And I respect all my council's comments, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| I think we've worked long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| that almost goes without saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| I'm concerned, again, with the density here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| I'm not opposed to housing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| but I'm thinking that RN5 is just too high a density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9042)|
| 2:30:47| And I wish that RN3 or RN4 had been explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9047)|
| 2:30:55| We've heard several concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| schools, traffic, greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| negative impact on the community, flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9063)|
| 2:31:06| I don't know that any one of those by itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| would completely make my decision for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| But at some point, it gets a bit cumulative for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9072)|
| 2:31:17| There's multiple concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9077)|
| 2:31:18| And some of them, it's really difficult for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| to see how it's going to play out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| particularly some of the things about the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| how you would incorporate the retention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9087)|
| 2:31:33| into a design that may have not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9093)|
| 2:31:38| I don't know that the design has been considered yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| about where a detention pond would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| And that's just one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9105)|
| 2:31:46| There's just some uncertainties with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| I just feel uncomfortable going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| all the way up to RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| So I just don't think I can support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| In response to this, and this might be for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9126)|
| 2:32:10| So prior to recode, I mean, just a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| it was an office which would have allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9134)|
| 2:32:19| I think, 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| And this proposal is approximately 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| which is substantially less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| Is that correct, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| Yes, Council Member, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| So from a density standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| they are proposing to max out what they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9159)|
| 2:32:47| With RN5, so okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| But they are choosing not to max out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| what they could from a dwelling standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9171)|
| 2:32:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| I'm not sure that I can speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| whether or not they're maxing out their density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| The way that the current zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| has been developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| the density is dictated by the dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| and what they can do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| So obviously, as you all have been having conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| about this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| there are some constraints associated with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| So we don't look at it in the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| in terms of strictly the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9202)|
| 2:33:26| Okay, but previously at 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| they could have had 10 more dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| so which would have been substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| Yeah, it would have had to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| through Development Plan Review for Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9216)|
| 2:33:39| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9220)|
| 2:33:43| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| You're on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| The first one's for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| Ms. Brooks, can you clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| It's my memory that I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| where Councilwoman Tesserman's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| but previously, prior to recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| when it was zoned office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| office did not allow residential, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| Let me, I'm going to look real quick at the old code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| I have to admit that I don't know it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9249)|
| 2:34:10| as well as I know the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| Give me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| I'm pretty confident that residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| was not allowed in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| But I shouldn't say that until you look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| And in conversation with Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| Director Green, and he had a big conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| about it being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| why he thought it should be office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| I don't want to argue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9275)|
| 2:34:36| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9276)|
| 2:34:40| Yes, I know in the old code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| there was reference to the R2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| and I might have misspoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| so if you'll just give me a moment, I'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9287)|
| 2:34:48| Miss Ryder, do you have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| for someone other than Miss Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9290)|
| 2:34:51| Yeah, so Mr. Forrester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| if Mr. Forrester is still available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9295)|
| 2:35:01| Mr. Forrester, are you still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| So it's my understanding that this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| was postponed for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| for that agreement to be drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| Yes, that was part of the reason, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| Okay, but the agreement has not been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| to the St. Andrews Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9320)|
| 2:35:23| It's been provided to council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9323)|
| 2:35:28| Okay, I just, I don't think I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| I would hope that it is your intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| to have an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| because that was my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| of what you're doing was drafting a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| with those neighbors to tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| that you were going to stand by them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| that Mr. Smith was going to stand by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| I don't live there, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| The agreement was prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| and it was entered into and submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| to council on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| And I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| some of the communication had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| that there was some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9363)|
| 2:36:04| I don't know which residents raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9364)|
| 2:36:05| the specific concern as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9365)|
| 2:36:09| what involvement the property owner would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| after the developer has taken over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| And the purpose was to submit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| to city council for forum purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| I really hope that you guys will provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| if the agreement's to be an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| it needs to be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| to the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| If the rezoning passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| the agreements with them, the commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| you used the word guarantee earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| the guarantee's with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| I believe Mr. Smith will stand true to his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| I just hope that you would give them a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| And I want to be clear to say St. Andrews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| not West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9404)|
| 2:36:45| It's a lot of conversation about agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| with and discussions with West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| The actual neighborhood there is St. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9410)|
| 2:36:53| So I just, please provide them a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| and have a conversation with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| about that if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| And there was no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| there was no reason not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9422)|
| 2:37:03| or no intent of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| Mr. Cannon, you have made yourself visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| Did you have something to add to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| The flooding stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9437)|
| 2:37:17| And Councilman Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| I wanted to come back to your comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| if I may, just very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9441)|
| 2:37:24| Today, and I'll keep using the 100-year event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9444)|
| 2:37:28| And the 100-year event in many circles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| is considered a pretty stringent event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| compared to some of the other storms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| that things are designed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9456)|
| 2:37:39| Today, there's so much runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| There's so much water leaving that site under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| if you will, forested conditions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| And there's a way of calculating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| Under the developed conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| no more can be directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| towards St. Andrews or downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| than what is happening today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| So whether it is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| I'll be facetious, please forgive me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| but let's say it's a 10,000 square foot house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| or it's an apartment development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| that's being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| or an office development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| Whatever that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| extra runoff that that development is generating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| it must be held in this retention pond bathtub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9499)|
| 2:38:24| so that no more is going to be going to St. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9504)|
| 2:38:29| I will say under the 100-year event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| but that is considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| and has been accepted as a pretty stringent yardstick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| for many communities throughout our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| and frankly through the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| Yes, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9525)|
| 2:38:46| Council Member Thomas, yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9526)|
| 2:38:47| Yeah, that was, of course, part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| The other one, if I understood you clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9530)|
| 2:38:55| the design of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| might be affected by where practicalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9537)|
| 2:39:04| required the retention pond to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9544)|
| 2:39:07| I mean, you just couldn't choose a spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9547)|
| 2:39:10| on the development and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| we're going to put the retention pond here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| It would have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| it depends on the configuration of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9556)|
| 2:39:19| Did I hear you right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| Council Member, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9561)|
| 2:39:22| They could choose to use two ponds as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9562)|
| 2:39:27| I'm just throwing out examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| I am finding back in my earlier days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| that quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| these retention facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9574)|
| 2:39:36| are probably driving more of the site design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| than what the desires are to put buildings up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| because it does take a significant area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| to accomplish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9592)|
| 2:39:53| Council Members, any more questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9598)|
| 2:39:59| I think Ms. Brooks has an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9602)|
| 2:40:03| I forgot to go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| Thank you for looking that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| I will say that I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| it's not clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| so I will read to you what's in the old ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| So, uses permitted in the O1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| which is what this property was zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9615)|
| 2:40:16| So, uses permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9616)|
| 2:40:17| the following uses shall be permitted in the O1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| Any use permitted as regulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| in the R2 General Residential District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| except multi-dwelling structures or developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| But then it goes on to say under uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| the following uses may be permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| in accordance with, I'll read all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| And the C1 is any use permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| in the R2 General Residential District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| and multi-dwelling structures or developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9643)|
| 2:40:44| as regulated in R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| Not sure if that clears it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| but that's what's in the old code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| Thank you for looking it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| Thanks for looking that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| So, that's clear as mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| It was allowed and it wasn't allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| and it was allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| So, that's kind of what I get from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| I will say, I agree with what all my colleagues have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210209?start=9668)|
