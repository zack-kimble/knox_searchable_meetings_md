| 0:01:47| Councilman Welch. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| We have a quorum with eight members present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| So Council, let's read in the ordinance number four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| 4A is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville to regulate the location, height, bulk, and number of stories and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=118)|
| 0:02:05| size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of the lot which may be occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| the sizes of yards, courts, and other open spaces, the density of population, and the uses of buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| structures, and land for trade, industry, residence, recreation, public activities, and other purposes, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| for such purposes to divide the municipality into districts or zones of such number, shape, and areas as it may determine and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=142)|
| 0:02:30| regulate the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, and uses of buildings and structures, and the use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=150)|
| 0:02:38| to prescribe penalty for the violation of its provisions, and to provide for its enforcement, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| to repeal ordinance number 3369, known and cited as the zoning ordinance of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee, and all amendments thereto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=163)|
| 0:02:51| all as the product of a public process known as Recode Knoxville, all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| Okay, Council. So for the record, I did not write that caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| That's quite a caption here, but it's legally required the way it is, but I do want to make some remarks to start us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| So, first, on today's Council agenda is a proposed ordinance that incorporates Draft 5 of Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| We also have a list of amendments that is on Council's, at your seat there, that staff is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| Mostly they are corrections and clarifications on Draft 5. Two amendments are more substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Councilman Starr has stated that Council should vote to postpone and go into a workshop to discuss the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| Other Council members have indicated a desire to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| I agree that the proposed ordinance is not ready to be voted on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| However, I am proposing that you defer making any motion to postpone until the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| and that we stay in session in order to consider the staff recommendations, and to make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| And any other amendments that Council might suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Let's work through each article, have full discussion with planning, staff, city staff, and Council, and hear public comments on each article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=244)|
| 0:04:15| If there are motions for amendments from Council, we will then vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| Those amendments then become a part of the public record, and part of an amended ordinance that will eventually, I hope, be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=260)|
| 0:04:29| I propose that no more changes be made to this document unless Council hears it in a Council session and votes to make the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=269)|
| 0:04:38| This way there is no confusion about what or why a change is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| There would be no Draft 6, or 7, or 8, and no more workshops, only official meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=282)|
| 0:04:50| We have a document, Draft 5, that is now in the form of an ordinance, and I propose we work from this document as amended from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=290)|
| 0:04:59| If there are issues for further review that come up in today's discussion, we will make note of them and staff will follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| We can discuss those at the next special called meeting, which, as previously announced, is on May 30th at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=307)|
| 0:05:16| The other issue, so that's what I'm proposing, that we go ahead and go through this document article by article and see what the issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=316)|
| 0:05:25| and what we're comfortable with or not, and the amendments that need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| The other issue that we're hearing a lot about is the official zoning map of RECO that accompanies the text of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=329)|
| 0:05:38| Planning and City staff have prepared some options to consider regarding the adoption of an updated zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| So for those who actually have a copy of this, I'm not going to go through the three options right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| but other than to tell you option one is to adopt the current Draft 4, and then changes get made as you move on after the adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=350)|
| 0:05:59| Option two is review the proposed Draft 4 map sector by sector in council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| with council meeting ahead of time to go over whatever issues you might want to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| but any change in the map would then be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| This is Draft 4 of the zoning map, where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Any change would be done publicly in a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| And then option three, adopt a zone neutral map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| The most equivalent zone from the current zoning ordinance would be applied to the old codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=384)|
| 0:06:33| There are some issues with that in some neighborhoods if that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| So there's pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| I'm putting these out right now, and if we have time at the end of this meeting to discuss them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| and you all make a decision, then let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| I propose that at the end of the meeting we discuss these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Depending on council's wishes, you can vote on an option tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| or delay consideration of the zoning map options until the May 30th special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| After the May 30th special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| it will likely be July before another council meeting can be scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| based on known schedule conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| This will give council and the public more time to review the amended ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| the amendments that are made today and any that might be made on May 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| and whichever option for the official zoning map is chosen prior to resuming council deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=441)|
| 0:07:29| So that is my proposal for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Councilman Serr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Thank you, Mayor. I think this proposal makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| I shared with council and with the public my thoughts that I wasn't ready to vote today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| but I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| I know that one of the frustrations people have had has been that the document keeps changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| and they don't know how and why it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| I think it makes sense for us to talk about amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| and have formal amendments voted on in regular order today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| and then at the conclusion, vote to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| To me, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| I think I'll have comments as we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| but the map is what's given me the most heartburn in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| we have a new code, so how is it being applied to all the parcels throughout the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| And so, looking forward to discussing the options laid out before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| Okay. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| And Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Just for clarification, so my understanding of what's being proposed in your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| is that we discussed the code, the written document, article by article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| that we would make motions, we would have discussion, make motions for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| Those would be voted on in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Those amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| Yes, any amendment that we want to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| I hope that the amendments that we have before you, let's see, this page here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| we ask that you do vote on these, any that you're comfortable voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| If there are any of these that, after hearing from staff and public and everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| any of these are just minor edits for clarification, most of those, except for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| I ask that you go ahead and vote on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| What we're trying to do, as Councilman Stair said, is that through the different drafts, things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| And they're all done for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| It's because staff has tried to be responsive to what they hear from council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| to what they hear in public meetings, and things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| But if you weren't in that particular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| then you might not understand why that change was made or who recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| And so I think up to now we did the proper process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| But now we're far along and we're at a point where now we need to say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| this is the document we're working on, and any changes happen in a public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| I mean all these have been public meetings, but in a public, in a council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| in an official council meeting where our staff people will right then edit the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| and then everybody knows what the discussion was, why the change was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| It does answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| So, again, just for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| So you would be voting today on amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| And at the very end, if there is a motion to postpone the amended document in total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| that would be a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| And if that's the will of the council, we will postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| We don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Since we'll be looking at this article by article, I mean, is there an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| and this may be a question for our legal counsel, is there an option to vote by article?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=646)|
| 0:10:55| Or do we need to vote on the ordinance overall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| Well, I think ultimately you're going to need to vote on the ordinance overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| In order to get it in shape to vote on, then doing it article by article by the amendment process makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=663)|
| 0:11:11| So we won't be actually voting on each article, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| We're only voting on the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| But that article won't change unless there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| another meeting where somebody proposes some other amendment to the article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| When it comes back to be voted on, it will be in the shape that it's in when you leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| I think that's important for me to understand that we're not going to kind of come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| and have the same discussion once again about that article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| Once we get through this process, if we're comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| is there going to be a mechanism to make sure, okay, we're on board with the discussion and the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| so that we don't then get stuck down the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Actually, what I had proposed is that, not that we vote on each article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| is that if there was consensus or a vote, could they go ahead and do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| Say, okay, we are all, I'm comfortable with article one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| And meaning that we wouldn't revisit it or not, or we need to always be open to revisit in case something comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| No, I don't think you're going to be able to vote it as a document article by article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| I think you're going to need to vote ultimately on the entire ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| So you'll be voting on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| And this way, we're just amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| With each vote, it would be an amendment to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| I'm really relieved that you're supporting postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| I think that relieves a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| But I also wanted to talk about, you had just said that we're going to have to vote on the entire ordinance in one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| I've been, all I've been hearing about this is a lot of fear and a lot of confusion from constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| I know that we've done a lot of public meetings and there's been a lot of information online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| And for a lot of people now, they feel like they've just now heard about it and we're just bulldozing it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| That's not how it feels on this side, but I understand that they feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| So, I'm trying to think of what will help constituents, the people of Knoxville, not feel so intimidated by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=795)|
| 0:13:24| And also make me not feel so intimidated by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| And I'm wondering if we can split it up into different sections and then vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| Residential, business, industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| And then, if we approve all three, maybe a final vote if we have to do it for the entire ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| Well, I think that's what you just addressed, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Yeah, I think that really is what I just addressed, saying that you really can't do it in individual parts like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| But, if you wanted to do it in the division of items that you talked about, like residential, industrial, commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| I guess it could be divided up in that fashion rather than article by article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| That's just two different ways of dividing up the project that you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| I think the most logical, consistent way to deal with this is more article by article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| So, you know, you've got a whole large number of articles here and you can deal with each as it comes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| And when you're done with that, you will have dealt with residential, commercial, and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| When we, because the articles kind of follow that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| You have article four, residential neighborhood districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| When we get to article four, you're dealing with residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| So, if there are amendments that you have to this reflecting what you've heard from constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=883)|
| 0:14:51| then that would be a proper time to make that amendment, to propose that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| If council agrees and votes for it, then that becomes an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| So, you've addressed residential, for an example, through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| But in the end, we have a document that is amended by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| and the document that comes to a final vote is one that's been thoroughly discussed in front of folks in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| in a meeting like this, and it's the product of numerous votes to get us to this final document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=917)|
| 0:15:27| I guess what I'm trying to do is figure out a way to insert time in between different sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| so that people can keep up with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Well, like I just said, we'll have, after the May 30th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| there will be likely at least four weeks, four to five weeks before the next meeting can be held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| based on just the schedule conflicts I already know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| And we need, after this meeting, we'll try to get everybody's summer schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| so we can see when the next meeting could occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| So I think that's going to, there's going to inject another four to five weeks after the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| at least, say, six weeks from today and another four to five weeks from the May 30th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| So that, and that's additional time for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| I'd also not like to completely rule out the idea of another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| Trust me, I'm not looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| But I think that we may need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| I think it would also be helpful for so many people who have just now heard about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| that we try to address the public, go out into the community again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Sorry, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| I know you've done a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| If there are particular groups that you would like someone to go and address, we will make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| So, is there, oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| Councilman Wallace, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Okay, so we're going to, you're suggesting that we make motions for amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| Take a vote on that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| In the end, we postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| So how do we lock in our votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| So the next time when we get together on May the 30th, how does that keep anybody from saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| well, I've changed my mind on that particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| and I want to rehash it and start all over and start in with a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| We're not locked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| It's more, it becomes more of a straw poll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Well, except that it's in the public record and you see where the majority, you may change your mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| but if, say, there was a vote and it was 9-0 and now you've changed your mind, you could still bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| And if you get a second for your motion and you get a majority, then it could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| But my point is that it happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| In front of the TVs, in front of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| I just don't know how we will keep from duplicating, rehashing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| Well, I guess I would say what's the other option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| The other option would be just hash it out and have the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| And I'm fine with a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| I think that's smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| I'd like to see six or eight weeks in between the vote the first time and the second time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| I think for all the reasons you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Just a sample time for people to look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| But it seems like to me we'll hash through each one of these articles tonight, make amendments, take votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| that are not going to be locked in, and then we're going to come back next time and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| well, here's the amendments that you made, here's the votes you made, and do we want to rehash that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| And it's like, well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| No, we don't want to rehash that unless somebody brings it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| We don't have to rehash it because the document will be here as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| Whatever votes you take tonight do not have to be rehashed unless somebody chooses to rehash them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| It's just like whenever when we have a proposed ordinance, when you amend that ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| you then vote on that ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Five, three readings is really what it comes down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| We're going to have the reading tonight, hash it out, come back, vote on it as amended, and then vote on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| We're going to end up voting on it three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| I mean, that's just so we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| You're just not locking in your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| I may vote for something tonight and it's like, well, after consideration, I've changed my mind, bring it back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| and we rehash it all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| That could happen between first and second reading on any ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| You could make a motion to amend it on first reading and then on second reading say, I changed my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| I want to re-amend it back to how it was originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| So, I mean, until it passes, it's always going to be up for amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| But when we take votes, and especially if they're lopsided, it's hard to get people to switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| But I think leaving that option open is good and healthy for the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| And here's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| So, it's not perfect, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| But somebody could rehash something that's already been hashed once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| Is that a word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| But the alternative is that nobody knows until the final day that you're going to vote what all those amendments are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1193)|
| 0:20:03| and how you're going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| So, you'll give us the amendments as amended then, and we'll get that between now and the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1205)|
| 0:20:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| There will be written, you know, this will be public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Will and Amy and Christina are tracking all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| And you'll have the document with a different color of amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Because this is the first time we've seen these proposed revisions to draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| I mean, it's the first, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| I know, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| That's why I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| This is, most of these, I think, if any of these you're not comfortable with, then we don't have to vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| We can vote on them on May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| I think a lot of these are pretty simple clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Anything you're not comfortable with, because you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| That's why I don't think you should vote today, because I've just given you these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| And so I don't think you should vote on it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| I mean, I don't think that this should be a final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| But some of these are very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| If it's anything that's more complicated, most of these have been discussed or they're just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| But if there's anything that you think needs more discussion, then don't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Then we won't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| And by the way, for the public, anybody, there are extra copies of these and, yeah, of these proposed amendments today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| I just want to make sure that I'm clear on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| So after we have our discussion this afternoon, if there's a motion to postpone, then the first reading of this would be on May 30th, not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1294)|
| 0:21:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| We may need more copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Yes, unless you decide to postpone it on May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| There will be a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| But, yes, we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| So if we vote to postpone today's not first reading, and I agree with the article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| But you want to get the map settled, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Yeah, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| And I agree with the article-by-article approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| If you all would share, that might help, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| I don't think we have enough copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| We'll get some more made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| I agree with the article-by-article approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| I also agree with basically holding the meeting the way you proposed so that we can talk about issues and amendments and get them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1341)|
| 0:22:31| kind of in a solidified form so that everyone has a chance to review those going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| So I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| I was just going to say, in terms of any edits or changes or amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| the discussion about whether we vote tonight or on first reading, vote next time, first reading, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| I think it would be unfair to the public to vote and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| If we change and amend things tonight, there are people that aren't here that can watch this recording later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| and might need to be aware of whatever changes we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| And so this is kind of in response to something Councilman Wallace said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| I think whatever changes we make tonight need some moment to stand for people to have a chance to review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| So I think that's the best practice, what we proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| So are we ready to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Without any objection, we will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| And we will start with Article I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| Everyone will look at Article I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| And do we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Can we ask for a clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| You know, we were all trying to get the amendment, Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| Is it going to be up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| We were trying to get copies of the amendments that the staff was distributing, so we missed part of the conversation up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| Obviously, we haven't seen these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| So when you're asking for public input on the amendments, you're not going to get any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| We haven't seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| The entire document was available 14 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| The clarification we need is any vote today is not first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| This is not first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| If they vote to postpone, which I would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| And once the amendments come out from this meeting, they are open to discussion again in the minds of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1470)|
| 0:24:42| They are not in any way fixed or assumed to have been agreed upon formally or informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1482)|
| 0:24:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Well, formally, it's been adopted as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| On first, then it's first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Then it's first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Well, let me ask the law director to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| I think it's sort of a matter of semantics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| It's going to be changed so that when you confront the document the next time you come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| which will be assuming we follow the procedures that have been proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| then when you come next time, it will be on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| but it will be on first reading with a document that has been changed in the fashion that it gets changed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1527)|
| 0:25:35| And then if further changes need to be made or if changes need to be made to those changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| the document is still open to be changed in that fashion in whatever way counsel feels it needs to be changed at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1541)|
| 0:25:49| It would just be this is the proposed document that we're looking at on first reading on May the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1549)|
| 0:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| See, he's saying there are two first readings being split into two parts, into two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| So I'm not the only one confused because he's pretty smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| So here's the usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| So here's the best I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| So here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Again, to be perfectly clear, we can't be sort of kind of first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| So this is not first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| This will, in fact, be a draft that where counsel has adopted what amounts to a draft 5.2 for the public to review for the next reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1586)|
| 0:26:40| Well, as we sit right now, we're on this document on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| And as we go through this process and it hasn't been moved for postponement yet, as we go through this process, we'll still be on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1605)|
| 0:26:54| So to that extent, as we're going through this document on first reading and there are proposed amendments to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1614)|
| 0:27:02| then it will have been amended during that meeting on first meeting on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| But if it gets postponed, then it won't be adopted on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| So it won't be a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| So it won't be a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| And it will basically be just a draft amended, draft 5.1, so to speak, amended by counsel in an informal sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1636)|
| 0:27:31| I don't know that it's an informal sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Well, in that it's amended, but those amendments are not first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| They are not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| I'll leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| So let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| First is Article 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| And I'm going to call on now the way, as you all know, Article 1, you look at pages 1-1 to 1-4 is Article 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1670)|
| 0:28:04| Mr. Green, do you want to comment on any of the, we're looking, this is draft 5, and there are, you can see the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1684)|
| 0:28:17| Are there any changes that were made in draft 5 that are shown with red lines or blue underlined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1697)|
| 0:28:25| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| And first I'd like to inform you that the AV is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| If we could have someone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| That's the late plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| They went through a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| It worked immediately before we got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| While we're, do you want me to proceed with Article 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| First I'd like to thank all the people who were interestingly involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| And the three are sitting here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| This was a huge effort by a limited number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| The Camaros consultants, planning staff, Amy, led by Amy Brooks, and the city law department with first Krista Cougarow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| who wisely found another position, and then Christina McGrans, and Peter Ahrens from the Department of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1746)|
| 0:29:15| Without these people, this would not have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| And I'd like to also point out in regard to the time that this has been spent on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| the first discussion of this effort began in December of 2015 and entered into early 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| with the city council providing funding to the planning department that was then, Knoxville, Knox County Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| that was then passed through to the consultants in May of 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| and the management contract entered into between Knoxville, Knox County Planning, and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| In June 2016, the RFP was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| In December 2016, a contract was entered into between the city of Knoxville and Camaros consultants for this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1790)|
| 0:29:59| In February 2017, the work actually began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| Camaros had, prior to that, reviewed plans, policy documents, existing zoning code for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| In March 2017, the public stakeholder advisory committee met for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| In May 2017, the website that was prepared by planning staff and managed throughout and updated by planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1816)|
| 0:30:26| appeared for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| In June and July 2017, there was a survey that had the greatest number of responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| of any survey ever undertaken by Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| September 2017, the technical report was released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| which provided the background information and the direction for the updating of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| In March 2018, Ordinance Draft 1 was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| In April 2018, planning contracted with the Knoxville Area Urban League and SEED and Centro Hispano| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| for community engagement to traditionally underrepresented communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| In August 2018, Map Draft 1 was released and Ordinance Draft 2 was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| In December 2018, Map Draft 3 was released and Ordinance Draft 4 was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| In January 2019, the Knoxville, Knox County Planning Commission voted to send recode to the Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| In February 2019, Recode Design Charette was sponsored by AIA East Tennessee Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| and the East Tennessee Community Design Center was held, as were two City Council workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| In April 2019, another City Council workshop was held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| In May 2019, on May 1, the Draft Code 5 and Map 4 were released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| In that time, over 80 community public meetings have been held to provide input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| and opportunities for people to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| This is a dynamic document that reflects the diversity of opinion in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| If you wait until everyone is happy, we'll be here for eternity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| What we are trying to do is create a document that implements the vision of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| that's stated in the plans and policies, and provide a code that will take us into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| What we have to have is a vision and knowledge that this code does not address what needs to be done tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| It addresses the template we want to create for the City of Knoxville in 10, 15, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| That's all the stalling I can do before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| Okay. Well, that was a really good overview of all the work that's gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| So let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| We're going to have to go ahead without the overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| But Article 1 is Title, Purpose, and Applicability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| And there were a couple of changes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| The first was the reference to adopted City plans and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| This recommendation came from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| Which number are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| That's Section 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| 1.2B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| And again, this is not something that has to be voted on as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| This is in the proposed ordinance now because this is Draft 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| But the change that was made in Draft 5, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| In Section 1.3.A, privately owned properties leased by county, state, and federal governments are subject to code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| although properties owned by those entities are not subject to the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| It makes a difference between private properties leased by those entities and the properties owned by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| In Section 1.4.H, the provision for a request to change to the prior equivalent zoning designation has been codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2012)|
| 0:33:49| That's something that you had asked about, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| This is just a section I think is pretty important, and I think it goes to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| And essentially this section just allows people to go to the prior equivalent zoning without a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| It enables them to request that zoning change without an application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| And I think the question for counsel, and I think the thing we all need to think about seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| is imagine one of these proposals coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| So think about somebody that has potentially a parcel that was zoned industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| and now has been zoned downtown or commercial or something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| and that parcel owner comes to us and wants it to go back to industrial and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| I bought this parcel or I had it rezoned or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| You know, that decision we would have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| and I don't know if we want to have deference to what it was prior to the recode process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| or, you know, do we just assess it like we do any other rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| You know, I think it's potentially for the future of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| It's something that we need to really think about, especially when we go to look at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| because there are changes to different parcels that, you know, affect the rights of property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| And so these could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| You know, this highlights that they get no fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| but the real issue is would the zoning go back or would we just address it, you know, parcel by parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| So I'd be interested in other people's thoughts on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| but I think it is a big issue and one we need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| This section does deal with the map, and I think one thing that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| and you've given us some options for adoption of the zoning map to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| but I think one thing we need to know about the draft map is like a list of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2142)|
| 0:35:50| So when in the recode map something went from one type to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| So, for example, if you went from office to commercial, if you went from residential to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| if we can get a list of where those occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| I think it may be easier for us to point out, you know, areas in the draft map that we may need to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| We're working on a list that has the number of parcels of the acreage that was changed from one classification to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| The best way to identify what you're talking about is going to the recode website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| and looking at the maps, and there's a draft five map and an ability to compare that to the current map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| So you can go parcel by parcel and identify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Well, and I understand that, but what we need is guidance to point us to where that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| Because I might look at it in one area and miss that, you know, next door to it was one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| And so I think that's why the list is important for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Map review, we'll show the map on that large screen and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| I can't, I don't know what resources it would take to create that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| We'll try to, but for three years, planning has dedicated a huge amount of resources to this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| I don't know what resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| We will figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| We will figure out how to get you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Mayor, just one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Just a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| This does not automatically let the property owner go back to whatever their equivalent zone was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| So you still have to go through the process of coming to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| And I think that's a difficult question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| We've had it come up before when someone, you know, when an owner owns a parcel and it has a certain number of rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2252)|
| 0:37:40| and they have that expectation and then it's changed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| are we going to give deference to that to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| or are we just going to consider it like we would consider any other rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| and think, you know, does this, you know, make sense in terms of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| It also may be dealt with when we get to the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| I think it's just something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| You know, we have to look in the future of these certain parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| And we had that happen with NSKIPP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| and one of the things we talked about was the actual notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| We talked about, you know, you zone this, it's going to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| So we've faced in the past and it was a difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| So, Gerald, the language in 1.4C, structures rendered nonconforming, and it references Article 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2302)|
| 0:38:36| So Article 17, a good bit of that's been stricken, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| And the reason that was stricken is that we revert to the current language for nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| We heard from council members, from council's attorney and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| that the current language had been tested and had proved successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| So rather than using the language that I'll call the national norm proposed by the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| we went back to the language that's in the current code for dealing with nonconforming structures, uses, and land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| So stricken is the six, there were references in other drafts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| and six months if it remains vacant and 12 months if it remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| So that's been stricken and we're back to our current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Any other discussion on Article 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Can I ask Mr. Green in 1.2B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| which is to promote orderly development of the city and implement the adopted plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| which incorporates more specialized adopted plans, including adopted sector plans, corridor plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| and small area plans adopted by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| The word including leads me to believe there are other perspective documents or supporting plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2396)|
| 0:40:05| Are there not, or is that the comprehensive list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| It leaves it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| To my knowledge, our plans are broken into the sector plans, the corridor plans, and small area plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2410)|
| 0:40:18| But there may be, I'm thinking there may be a neighborhood plan, and we have not listed that as a unique list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| So we're not creating a closed category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| We're leaving it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Any plan adopted by the city could be considered as one of those plans that this document is intended to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2431)|
| 0:40:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| And this wording and language came largely from conversations with members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| wanting to make sure that we're not exclusive, that we're included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| realizing that we couldn't include the list of every type of plan that may be prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| that we kept the list inclusive as opposed to closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| And I didn't see a comparable statement in the previous code or the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| Is there something comparable in the existing that delineates the sector plans, corridor plans, small area plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| It does say comprehensive plan, but it doesn't list the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| It doesn't list them out specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| Item 1.3A, you've changed it for privately owned properties leased to the county, state, and federal governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2483)|
| 0:41:32| Are there examples, and do we need to make an amendment here for businesses renting space from the government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2492)|
| 0:41:41| If it's government-owned property, it's not subject to the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| But if a private business were in, they wouldn't be subject to the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| If it's, in my knowledge, and I'll turn to Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| but if it's federally, state, or county-owned property, it's not subject to the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| That's my understanding, regardless of who's renting or using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| That's generally true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| But if the property is leased to a private entity for strictly private uses and not public uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| then certainly it could be subject to the same requirements, just like with our tax code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| Like land that we own generally is not subject to taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| But if we, for example, rent a piece of our property because we don't have a use for it at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| we rent it to somebody and they're using it for a strictly private purpose, running a restaurant, running a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| something like that, then they're subject to the same taxation as everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| So that's how this would operate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| So we don't need to state that in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Is that clear in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Is it clear the way it's worded from a legal perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| Does it need clarity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| It's clear enough to me, but if you wanted to make it more clear, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| I'm sure we can come up with language that will be more clarifying in that regard if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| If you feel like it's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Well, we've clarified privately owned properties leased by government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| but we haven't clarified businesses leasing from the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| The assumption there is that they would be used for a government purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| But we haven't included that assumption in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| so we could amend it to include that assumption, that being utilized for a government purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| If you would like for us to spend some time between now and then coming up with a clarification, we'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Add that to the list, Christina, of looking at clarifying that if a business is leasing from a government agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| that they would be subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Federally owned and used property and occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| We'll come up with language hopefully that is more easily understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| She's writing that right in there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Good catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Counselor Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| So, Gerald, back to existing uses, 1.4.B.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| We're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| 1.4.B.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| We're talking about enlarging or expanding non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| So in Article 17, we can, if I read it right, it is any expansion of that is subject to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2672)|
| 0:44:46| Is that the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| And that's currently the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| That's currently the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Even though it says a little bit different in 17, but that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| You're clear that the language in 1.4.B.2 gives us the, we're still subject to the BZA in the end if we want to expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2698)|
| 0:45:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| It's not totally prohibited, prohibited subject to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| So you feel like the language is clear there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| I think it is, but after Peter and I are gone, we may want to make that more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| It seems to be a little bit of a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| I don't know which one rules over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| We can clarify 1.4.B.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| 1.4.B.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| You're making a note to see if that can be clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Well, it seems a bit conflicting, and when it references on down Article 17, you flip over to Article 17, it gives you a right to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2734)|
| 0:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| That's all I got on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| That's all I got on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| That's on the list to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Are there public comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Anybody who wishes to speak to that, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| And the shorter you make it, the concise, concise, but please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| We're just here to take up a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| Carly Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| Specifically, what I'd like to talk about is, and it has to do with the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| It's the H section that was added in Draft 5, and I'm pleased that it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| But the maps, not to become obsessive about it, the maps are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2793)|
| 0:46:41| I agree with Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| That's where the rubber hits the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| At the beginning, everyone was talking about zoning neutrality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| And we know there is not zoning neutrality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| There isn't zoning neutrality in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| One is the zones are not a one-to-one match with the existing zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| So even though you have a residential one zone, it may not be, when it becomes R and 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2823)|
| 0:47:11| if you were R1E or whatever, it's not a one-to-one match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| The zone you've been given is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| The other thing is not just the language of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| but actually going to a zone that is different from what you presently have, totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| Going from residential to commercial or office or the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| And this is particularly striking when the one-year plan, the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| the adopted plans, for instance, show medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| and the zoning is medium-density residential at present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| but it shows up on a recode map as commercial, neighborhood commercial, general commercial, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| So those are two different ways where you don't have one-to-one neutral changes in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| And as we've worked through this, and the mayor just gave three different ways of looking at the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| And there may be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| And there may be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| I think the third way, which is going one-to-one as close as you can, may be the way to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| to cut down the most conflicts, to take the fewest number of people by surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| and allow people to come in, again, with changes that they may want to request to their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2906)|
| 0:48:35| Maybe they've gone from this commercial to that commercial, but they've lost uses, even though it's commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2915)|
| 0:48:43| But you'll get rid of the, we've gone from residential to office or office to commercial big map changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2923)|
| 0:48:52| So I'm glad this is in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| I understand what it's trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| But I think the mapping, the three mapping options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| the neutral one is ultimately going to be the one that's the least fraught with issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| Anything else on Article I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Any other public comments on Article I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| Councilman Wallace, are you still on Article I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| We've got someone coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Or are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2967)|
| 0:49:35| And what I'll do, like we do at council meetings, is I'll set a timer for up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| But please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| My name is David Hamilton, 1810 Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| This is my law office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| I'm from 2000 Fremont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| And I'm president of the Norwood Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| I listened to the comment concerning the potential for taxation of private business using governmental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=2994)|
| 0:50:04| and whether or not property taxes are going to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| As to personal property, I believe that that's already taken care of under existing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| But the suggestion that there would be a mandatory requirement for payment of real estate taxes by a private organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3015)|
| 0:50:29| using or renting governmental property I think is incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| unless there's a belief that there would always be a provision in contract between the city and those entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3034)|
| 0:50:44| If you are moving forward, and unfortunately none of the Article I material was handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3044)|
| 0:50:53| It begins with Article II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Sir, let me explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| These are just amendments that we are requesting in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| There wasn't anything that staff recommended on Article I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| That's why Article I is not on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| I'm just making it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| I'm just bringing it to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| However, the tax issue would seem appropriate for clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| because it appears that the sense of the city council is that there would be taxation of private entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3079)|
| 0:51:27| David, I don't mean to interrupt you, but I am going to interrupt you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| because the whole tax issue has nothing to do with the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| It was just an example I was using as how governmental property might be treated differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| If you believe I'm wrong about that, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| But it has nothing to do with the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Our zoning code has nothing to do with taxation of real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| Except that you mentioned it in Article I and you discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| So I respectfully disagree with you, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| I think that you and I have been at cross swords in the past, and we may do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| But this was for my personal comment to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| And if you want to do a discussion between council, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| But thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Let's bring this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Just to clarify, this is about whether the zoning code applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| And since you don't have that before you, you didn't see what we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| So I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| But this is about the zoning code and not about taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| However, you're discussing taxation in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| And the whole purpose for the zoning is taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Anybody else who would like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Councilman Dellivopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Good afternoon, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Nick Dellivopi, Criswood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| You may have already covered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| In 1.2B, which Gerald was talking about, there's a generic description of adopted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| In Article 1, actually 1.2.B, we're covering all the adopted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3183)|
| 0:53:11| It doesn't specifically mention one-year plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| And I know there's been discussions in the past about whether we're going to do away with those or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| Is it purposely omitted or is it just covered in the generic description and the others are illustrative only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| That's kind of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| It's just covered in the generic description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| And I'm sorry I forgot one-year plans when Councilmember Ryder asked that question, but we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3212)|
| 0:53:39| I think no matter how we tried to list every type of plan, we missed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| So that's why it says including and it's inclusive and not exclusive, the listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Does that answer your question, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Maybe not the wisest thing, but I'm going to speak up because I do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| My question arose from a constituent about B1.3A, which is, and I will clarify for Mr. Hamilton, it had nothing to do with taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3243)|
| 0:54:19| I work for the state in another, when I wear another hat on my head, at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| The state is not subject to local permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| And as an example, Pellissippi, the state, owns the Straw Plains campus out off Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| And they only use a third of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| And they have lease agreements with other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| One of them happens to be the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| The other happens to be either the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| There's three governmental entities leasing parts of the building that the state doesn't use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| Because they're all governmental, they're not subject to the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| It's not about taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| It's about building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| As an example, the Pellissippi campus I work at doesn't have to pave their parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| even though our code, our building code, says that they're supposed to under city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| But they're the state, so they are exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| I ask the question because if an entity like the city or the state leased out a section of a building that they weren't going to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3320)|
| 0:55:30| do the entity, the private entity, a private citizen, John Q. Citizen, rented out that space with his business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3330)|
| 0:55:39| do the building codes apply to him, whereas they don't apply to the governmental entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| which is the standard across the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| I'm just clarifying my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| It had nothing to do with taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Let's just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Moving on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Anything else on one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| Anything next on one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| So there are a few things that we are going to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| So at the next meeting, we will have those for you all to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| If there's no objection, we'll move on to Article 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| Article 2 is General Definitions and Measurement Methodologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Let's start with Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Are there any particular changes in Draft 5 that you want to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| A couple of changes I'll go over quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| In Section 2.1.E, cannot is now identified as mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| In Section 2.3, there are revised definitions for approximately a dozen terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| including accessory structure and accessory use, which are from the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| We inserted those from the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| There's a new definition for adjacent based on an issue before the Board of Zoning Appeals recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| There's a new definition for nightclub based on input from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| There's a new definition for revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| The zoning administrator is identified and defined in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| And there's a definition for one term, dwellings, multi-dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| That definition has been deleted because that term is not used in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| And the Bill 2 dimensions in Section 2.4.C cannot is replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| Hey, slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Okay. Those were the definitions that you're saying you're explaining the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| Changes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| You're so familiar with this that you can just rattle it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| But for those that are trying to follow, I just want to slow it down a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| So those were examples to the definitions that were either added or changed based on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| I did miss one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| The Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission and staff are revised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| and that's in deference to the recent name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| It states that it's formally known as Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| Okay. So before you get off definitions, okay, are you still on definitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| Definitions, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Okay. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| I do have, and I don't know if this is the proper time to insert this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| but there is a staff recommendation for a revision or amendment to the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| The recommendation was to change the name in the base zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| which is one of the first definitions from base zone, to base or underlying zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| That's just for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Right. This is on page 2-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| You see where it says red, I mean, in blue, underlined, it says base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| The recommendation from staff is that to read base or underlying zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| And the reason for that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| Some people are unfamiliar with the term base zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| but it's the underlying zone when there's an overlay such as a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| For example, in Old North, the underlying zoning would be RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| or base zone would be RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| The overlay would be the historic or H overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| Move to amend as suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| Okay. Is there any discussion from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| any concern about changing base zone to, say, base or underlying zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| Nobody wants to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3560)|
| 0:59:29| Okay. So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| That has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| That is number one on this sheet, article 2, definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| We changed base zone to base or underlying zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Revisions to article 2 and section 2.4.C, the word cannot is replaced with must not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| What number is that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| Section 2.4.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Page number first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| Follow instructions. I didn't put page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| Stick to the page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| 2-29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| 2-29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| 2-29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| 2-29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| Okay. Bill 2, dimensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Yes, and that's C2 on page 2-29, and it must not, both in C1 and C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3616)|
| 1:00:26| must not is replaced with cannot and well is replaced with must,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| to clarify that these are mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| Do you see all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| We're just saying rather than saying cannot, it says must not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| Instead of saying will, it says must, and that is what was in the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| Any other changes you want to point out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Just on page 2.35 in L1 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| 2-35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| L1 and 2 at the top of the page, clarification of lot lines, identifying what the lot lines are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3656)|
| 1:01:05| Okay. That's in blue. That was added in draft five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| And then at the bottom of page 2-35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| the sign measurements have been moved to this area from Article 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| because this article has all the other measurements and methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| What page are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Page 2-35 at N on 2-35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| In big red, there's a note that the sign measurements have been moved here from Article 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| to keep all the measurements in one article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3689)|
| 1:01:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Anything else you want to point out on Article 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| That's all the revisions to Article 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| Gerald, I'm looking at page 2-13 under the definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3707)|
| 1:01:55| almost down to the bottom of the page, the definition for home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3715)|
| 1:02:04| Is my microphone working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Can you explain why commercial was struck from that definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| This was actually a comment from the public stating that they're, just for clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| that they did not, there was an unease with the word commercial in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| thinking that some home occupations may not be considered themselves a commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| For example, if I had my planning consulting firm in my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| I may not consider that a commercial activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| but it's more clear-setting any activity carried out for economic gain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| rather than any commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| I think the opinion or thought was that that cast a broader net| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| and more clearly defined home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| So I guess my interpretation of this is this actually makes this definition really more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3773)|
| 1:03:02| because it broadens it, I'm concerned that it's restricting the ability of people to have home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3782)|
| 1:03:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| Because that term commercial to me was, it helped clarify what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3798)|
| 1:03:26| So if I'm doing a web-based business in my house, is that considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| That would be considered a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| And that, your comment is reflective of the diversity of opinion in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| because there are those who feel that having the term commercial in there makes it too narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3822)|
| 1:03:51| And you have the opposite opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| which is a challenge that we all have in trying to reach an agreement on even definitions of terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3834)|
| 1:04:03| So, I mean, the definition kind of goes along with the standard in Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3843)|
| 1:04:12| So I just, I'm curious to hear what other council members think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| that removing that word to me is significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| and particularly given sort of where we're headed as a community, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| and as a society with more entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| And, you know, I think that what I'm finding in the code is that regulating the impact on the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| is really the thing that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| You know, we want to make sure that any use of residential property is not having a negative impact on surrounding residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3879)|
| 1:04:48| but we don't want to do that, in my opinion, in a way that is also restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| given the way our economy is heading and more small businesses and home-based businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| So this, to me, by striking the word commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| it seems to broaden and sort of water down and potentially have a negative impact on entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| I just wanted to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| I'm curious to hear what other council members think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| So let's talk about it, and then if there's an amendment you want to make, we can listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| I was just going to say, to me, it's a broader term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| and commercial is included within the umbrella of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| That's our feeling, that when we are stating carried out for economic gain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| that addresses whether it's commercial or, again, using myself as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| It might be repetitive to say commercial and economic gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| Is that what the comment was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| I think that was what our feeling was, that if it's carried out for economic gain, it's basically a commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3943)|
| 1:05:55| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| Yeah, I would say that the removal of commercial there is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| Commercial activity is carried out for economic gain, so we're just repeating ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| So I think taking it out is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Is there any other discussion on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| Councilman Roberto, is that an old light there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| No, it's a new light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| On page 214.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| The definition of kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Kennel is a facility where five or more dogs and or cats over the age of six months are boarded for overnight and short-term stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| The issue I have with that term is the word boarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| In the current zoning ordinance, kennel is defined as kept, and kept is a more broad term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| and I think maybe a better term as it's more clear about what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| because boarding could be considered something other than keeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| and if you're keeping that many animals in a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| then I think we want to be clear there that that's what this is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4035)|
| 1:07:23| So I would make an amendment to change the word boarded to kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4043)|
| 1:07:32| There's a motion to change boarded to kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| So, Mr. Green, do you have any comment on that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| No comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| Whatever you decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| So all of the kennels and animal keeping is discussed in Chapter 5 of our existing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4066)|
| 1:07:56| not in the Appendix B ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| So the word kept and kept is used repetitively throughout Chapter 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| so it's just to get conformity with that chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| Are there any comments from the public before council votes on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| I can't see in the shadows back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Someone who hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| You can't see what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| Mayor, we're working on the lights right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| We're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| State your name and address again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| David Hamilton, 1810 Merchant Drive, on the home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| And I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Sir, we're talking on kennel right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Is there going to be a Chapter 2 discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| We will get to home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| As to kennel, I think that a more appropriate approach would just be to refer it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| Chapter 5 of the existing ordinances and not make a definition of kennel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4143)|
| 1:09:10| potentially could be in conflict with the existing ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| I agree with the amendment that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| The problem with Chapter 5, which is the animal code, is it says here's a definition of kennel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| which uses the word kept repeatedly, as has been pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| And it says wherever you want to put a kennel, go to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| Chapter 5 doesn't tell you where to put a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| It just tells you what a kennel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| The only way the city of Knoxville enforces if one of your neighbors –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| when I was on council, you get a call, somebody's neighbor has ten dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| they're barking, they smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| The only way we could enforce it was by saying you're in a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| That does not allow kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| You can't keep more than five dogs or four dogs, whatever, over the age of six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| If you don't have an adequate definition that comports with Chapter 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| you will have no way of limiting the number of dogs on a residential lot in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| And you can say, well, call the police when they're barking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| But the truth of the matter is when you go to court, they argue, well, the police showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| Of course the dogs were barking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| So you need this and ask that you approve that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| You agree with the kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| Did you have a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Mine is not about kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| Well, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| So right now, any other discussion on amending this to say kept instead of boarded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Let me see if Council has any more questions on Article 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4252)|
| 1:11:01| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| One of the things that we talked about and was identified as a change was the definition for zoning administrator on page 227.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4264)|
| 1:11:12| 2-27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| And I'm just looking for some clarity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| And I think Peter might be the right one to ask since he is the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| If you go to page 14-2, it starts to define what the zoning administrator and the director of plans review and inspection are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4285)|
| 1:11:35| among other things, and giving the powers to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| In this definition, those things are kind of jumbled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| Is there some clarity that's needed there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| If they're considered to be the same person, you know, why are we having two separate lists of powers for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| Are we anticipating sometime in the future they might be two different people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| That's the point of clarity I was asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| I'll address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| It's anticipating that they could be two different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| For example, in many cities the planning director is designated as zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| and then there's a separate chief building official, which is in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| is the director of plans review and inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| So it's leaving that option open, not combining those two titles, but leaving them separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| so that if there is some change in designation of the zoning administrator in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| that would not require a revision of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Can I, I feel like we're skipping around two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Animal care facility, small animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| You're on page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Beginning of the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Two dash three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Animal care facility, large animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| Small animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Small animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Facility, so the next to last sentence is animal care facilities do not include animal breeders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| I would suggest striking that last sentence and just saying animal care facilities do not include animal breeders and kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4391)|
| 1:13:21| Or kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| You're saying strike facilities for animals boarded for overnight and short-term stays are considered a kennel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| Animal care facilities do not include animal breeders or kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| I'd second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| That full last sentence says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| So just for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Did you, let's make sure our, did you get that, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Under animal care facility dash small animal, the last sentence would be, you would strike out facilities for animals boarded for overnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| and short-term stays are considered a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| Strike that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| And then instead after the sentence before it, animal care facilities do not include animal breeders or kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4439)|
| 1:14:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4449)|
| 1:14:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Or kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| And then you strike the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| I need some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Do I have, that was a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| I made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| There was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Just, I'd like some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| You're saying to not include animal breeders in a, as an animal care facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| That was already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Animal care facilities do not include animal breeders because if you turn and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4484)|
| 1:14:54| I think that is covered in chapter five of the animal code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4494)|
| 1:15:03| Animal care facilities do not include, I'll have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4503)|
| 1:15:32| Animal breeders, that's what, I'm sorry, I'm looking at a B for breeders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| Does that make sense for that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Let's try to, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4543)|
| 1:15:52| No, I'm not hitting the black button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Now am I working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Okay, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| I've been silenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| No, no, we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| I know, I put it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| That's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Only in rare circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| That's all I have to say about that sentence and that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Okay, so did you get, did your answer get, I mean, did your question get answered, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| That it's included within the other term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| So council is clear that we're striking the last sentence in the definition of animal care facility-small animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4580)|
| 1:16:28| and instead the second to the last sentence now is, or the last sentence now would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| animal care facilities do not include animal breeders or kennels, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| So we have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| That gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| Do you have another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| Yeah, I have a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| Okay, so while we're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| can we turn a couple of pages back to 2-1 and talk about 2.1D and E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4615)|
| 1:17:04| The terms must, shall, and will are mandatory while the word may is permissive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| Our existing code uses may as a permissive term exclusively, so there's several points of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4630)|
| 1:17:19| And this has come up in my neighborhood before because in our historic design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| it's defined out as specifically the terms should, shall, and must mean compliance is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| So one concern that I have, other than a couple of examples of confusion where may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| and may are used in the same sentence and cause confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| is we have other documents within MPC or planning commission that are defining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| and using different terms, should, shall, and must for compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| So as an example, and this is going to require some flipping around, 10.3A, which when I get there, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4675)|
| 1:18:12| See, this is the problem with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| Page 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| 10-4, section 10.3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| No accessory structure may be constructed prior to construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| I just think it's confusing and it would be more clear if it said shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| And then number two, a building permit may be required for the construction of an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4712)|
| 1:18:40| So maybe it's required, maybe it's not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| So I think it should be a building permit shall be required for the construction of an accessory structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| per the building code, unless there's an exception to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| I can think of one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| I'm thinking of keeping these and I'm not going to, and that's considered an accessory structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| and I'm not going to get a building permit for that accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Is there another thing we could say besides may?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| I think, well, I'll let Peter answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Some of these accessory structures could be considered, I think, aviary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| And I'll let Peter answer with regard to chicken coops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| I think they may be regulated by the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| But I'll let Peter answer since he's in charge of the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| I do agree that in 10.3A.1, that should be shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| No accessory structure shall be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| So you may, in 10.3A.2, I'll wave up that answer to Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| I'll leave the answer on whether a building permit is mandatory and not up to Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4787)|
| 1:19:55| I think as long as we reference the adopted building codes, we'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| There are exceptions in the 2018 residential code and building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| But we still want to review them for zoning compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| And so I think it's worthwhile to have language in there that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| they may be required subject to the adopted building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4814)|
| 1:20:22| So you want to keep the word may in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| 10.3A.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| That way, if it meets the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| No, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| You want to keep the word may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| I'm on 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| 10-4, 10.3A.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| You want to keep it, a building permit may be required for the construction of an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| And I would add language subject to the adopted building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| When it says per the building code, that part's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| I think that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I know that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| I think the problem is the word may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| I'm not saying it's inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| It's how you use the word may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| And in other places and other documents, we use it as permissive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| May, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| It depends on the size of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| And that's why it's subject to the adopted building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| Because there are small structures, less than 200 square feet in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| without a permanent foundation, where a building permit is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| How about a building permit can be required for the construction of an accessory structure per the building code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| That sounds wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| I'd like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| So, can you hold that when we get to 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Just so we've got these all in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| So, don't forget that when we get to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| And will you want to comment on that when we get to 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| I want to give you one second for it, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| Nick Delvaux with Crestwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| When it's may and not, it means you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| And you might just rearrange the sentence that's bothering you to say the accessory structure may not be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| You're saying you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| I mean, I don't think you're going to have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| If I may, on Part E, we do have may not being prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4927)|
| 1:22:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| And I think that's the part of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| And this goes to Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| So, actually, we're back to Article 2, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| We're back to Article 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Page 2-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| But if I turn to – hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| I'm going to turn to 4-2, page 4-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| Not to be confused with Section 4-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| I just want to give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| Page 4-2, Section 4-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| They happen to be one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| Part B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| That's to do with uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Under uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| In the R and 4 district, townhouse and multifamily dwellings may be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| or may require a special use approval based upon the development form and number of dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| How about in – but you guys are asking me not to make these amendment suggestions so we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| I just – in the R and 4 district, townhouse and multifamily dwellings – I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| Multifamily dwellings shall be permitted – dwellings shall be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| but can require a special use approval as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| I'm just saying it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| We have other documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| You just told me it's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| I can't figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| It seems like townhouses shall be in the R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| So, if I have a lot that's owned R and 4, I have to have a townhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| If it's not permitted, I think yours is – your statement makes it very mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| that the only thing permitted would be those types of developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| What we're saying is that they may be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| If you wish to do that, you can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| but they may require a special review if they meet certain standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5040)|
| 1:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Someone want to speak to that topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| We'll get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| You want to, Carlene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| The problem with may is sometimes it's used as permissive and sometimes it's used as speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| And sometimes it's just used kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5071)|
| 1:24:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| Oh, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| Does that work now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| I'm going to lower my arm rest because it hit it accidentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| But if you look at Article 2 –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| Oh, I'll raise it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| Article 2, Section 2.3, the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| Industrial – heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| It goes on to say manufacturing from process, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| Then you have the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| this manufacturing may produce noise, vibrations, illumination or particulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5112)|
| 1:25:20| that is perceptible to adjacent land users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| I don't think you mean it's permissive to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| I think it's saying maybe you might anticipate these impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| So that's where the use of may, you know, has so many meanings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| It's permissive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| You may do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| It's speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| You may need a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| And here it's kind of wacky that it – what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| Are you saying it's permitted to put out particulate matter to adjacent properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| Frankly, in contrast to a later section that deals with environmental impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| So I think every place in this document where the word may appears needs to be looked at carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| and I don't think you have enough time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| She may do it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| Yes, Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| So in our current zoning ordinance, we use the word may frequently as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5177)|
| 1:26:26| Just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| Under the I-2 restricted manufacturing, in the general description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| it says these industries may require direct access to rail, air or street transportation routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| So there is the use of that word in our current document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| I'll just add that I think that's a challenge with the English language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| and what we have to do is look at these sentences in context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| and I know it's unusual, but actually use common sense when we review these sentences and think about how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5215)|
| 1:27:02| I don't think that's unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| We use all kinds of common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Everybody in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Keep in mind that may can be permissive, but it also may be just maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5227)|
| 1:27:15| And just read the sentence in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| That's why we have a very talented zoning administrator who can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| if there's a question about the use of the word, then he can render a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| We can't redefine the English language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| What I would ask is why don't we, those are really good points, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| And what I would ask is perhaps Councilwoman Ryder, if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| and maybe Peter and Gerald, if you want to talk about this some more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| and if you, you know, if there's anybody else who is concerned about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| and if there's something that should be brought back in two weeks on May 30th to consider, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5270)|
| 1:28:00| Since, like you said, we're not going to solve it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| But it's something to consider, and if you all would look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| and see if there's any more clarity that you can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| Maybe you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| We may do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| On page 2-26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| I need to ask a question regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Christine, so you're taking a note of that, that we have to circle back on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| Councilwoman, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| 2-what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| 2-26, under window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| I just need to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| It states here a type of attached window, attached sign placed within a window facing the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| placed in a window for the purpose of advertising products, services, or the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| and may be comprised of applied letters, symbols, neon, or similar lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| but may not obscure the view of the interior of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| Are we saying that if I'm a business owner and I want to have a sign on the window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| there has to be visibility to the interior of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| I cannot have that sign to encompass the entire window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| That's correct under that definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| but what we'd have to look to also are the standards for window signs themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| And one of the great things about me not being the zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| is I don't deal with the sign ordinance, so I'll defer to Peter on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| I'd just like to know the rationale as to why a business owner could not have a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| that encompassed the entire window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| What is the rationale behind having to have visibility inside the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| Part of it is safety, just to be able for those passersby to be able to see into the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| and if there's something suspicious going on, they can notify the correct authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| Also, to create some, from a pedestrian standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| just some interest in the building that they would look in, and it's not covered by a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| I can see what the merchandise is, what the business activity is, and I'll let Peter provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| For point of reference, this came out of Article 8 of our current zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| and it wasn't changed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| Cameros was given the directive not to change any of the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| the sign portion of our ordinance, and so that language is verbatim as to what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| So have we seen any complaints as it relates to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| I did get some feedback on this in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| so I just kind of wondered this could be potential new business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| or people that are looking to start businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| We get all sorts of complaints about signs, pros and cons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| and that's more of a policy decision that was made back in the fall of, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5439)|
| 1:30:48| Summer of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Summer of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| And that was something that Cameros didn't open up that Pandora's box with this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Councilwoman Sincerez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| Any other council questions about Section 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| I mean, sorry, Article 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| Takes the village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Now we'll hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| Name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| And I'm talking about amusement facilities, not about animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5482)|
| 1:31:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| What page are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| We're on a definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Well, unfortunately, I'm working from Draft 4, but it's a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| So in Draft 4, it's 2-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| I think it's probably around 2-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| 2-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| Definition of amusement facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| 2-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| Okay, so this is triggered by a change that is in the use of matrix in Article 9.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5514)|
| 1:32:03| where commercial CG districts, 1, 2, and 3, were previously excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5523)|
| 1:32:13| They did not permit any outdoor amusement facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| And now it's been added in the use matrix as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| But the reason I'm bringing it up here is I think the answer lies in a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| a refinement of the definitions, particularly for outdoor amusement facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5549)|
| 1:32:36| If you look at that, you're talking about various facilities that really don't apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5556)|
| 1:32:44| or would not be suitable to an in-town type of corridor, as opposed to a highway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5564)|
| 1:32:53| So things like stadiums, fairgrounds, batting cages, miniature golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| But in contrast, you could have, like, indoor facilities that also might want an outdoor concession stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5580)|
| 1:33:15| an outdoor freestanding outdoor restaurant, freestanding outdoor retail sales in the CG type district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5595)|
| 1:33:28| What I would suggest is that you consider having two different categories here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| One is amusement facility limited outdoor, and the other is amusement facility outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5613)|
| 1:33:42| It's something for you to think about because it's going to come up when you get to Article 9.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5622)|
| 1:33:51| I would also point out that the amusement facility for indoor is similarly a very expansive category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5631)|
| 1:34:01| and you're applying it to both CG and CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| And many of the things that are listed there would not apply, would not be appropriate in CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| but would be appropriate in CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Okay, so do we want to, when we get to Table 9.1, then come back and look at this as they're looking at what's permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5657)|
| 1:34:26| Yeah, I may not be here at that late hour, but I wanted to offer that there may be a change in the definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5666)|
| 1:34:38| that will make this more doable when you get to 9.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| Just to make a note, when we get to the one that I know we're going to do, 9.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5684)|
| 1:34:59| Okay, consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| And Mayor, that's on page 9-2, or yeah, 9-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| It's amusement facility outdoor on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| and then you go to CG, and it's got an S with an underline, so it was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| Okay, so will you help us remember when we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| Jamie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| Mine's more of a general comment, so I don't know where to insert mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| but I wish I would reconsider having copies made, hard copies of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| because either I don't have very good eye-hand coordination or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| but I'm not really good with the computer and coming back to version 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| Of this, you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| I have version 4, and I think the majority of the people out here have 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| and it's really hard to follow because there's a lot of substantive changes from 4 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| so I would just request that you make maybe a limited number, but some copies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| because this is really difficult, and this is the most important version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| That's what we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| Well, look, so what's going to happen is, after today, we will have online, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5768)|
| 1:36:15| this as, not immediately, I mean, they're going to have to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| but we're going to be putting in the, you'll see the amended, as this has been amended, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5779)|
| 1:36:29| I did say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| That's why she's right now, Christina is making the changes as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| So that way you will see the full document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| It will be online, and then we can consider making, so you do have a copy of 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5797)|
| 1:36:43| Four, but it's really hard to post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| So I guess what we'd like to know, maybe if somebody would like a hard copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| if you could let Fiona know, see Fiona over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| If you would let her know if you want a hard copy of the next, of this or of the amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5817)|
| 1:37:05| Well, if you're trying to follow with 4 and do what y'all are doing, I got to 229,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| and mine doesn't go that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Yours went to 235, and I'm sitting there thinking, where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| If you would see Fiona, we'll get you a copy of that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5839)|
| 1:37:26| I can say, you know, it's page such and such in draft 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| How many people have draft 4 with you that you're trying to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| Are there some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| We've got draft 4 here, so if Rob said he'll try and help just for tonight, it doesn't solve the bigger problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| David Hamilton, 1810 Merchant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| At 213, home occupation, I was here at the meeting where they had the phrase commercial debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5869)|
| 1:38:00| This was the interstellar communications issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| I'm sorry, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Please keep talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| The interstellar communications issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| The language that you're going to, I believe, is overbroad, because it's capturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| and making an issue of every small piece of economic activity when the whole idea should be that commercial activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5892)|
| 1:38:23| which might intrude upon the neighborhood in some situation, such as people driving to your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5903)|
| 1:38:32| You don't want to have a whole bunch of people driving there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| You don't want to have commercial activity in the form of UPS trucks stopping and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5915)|
| 1:38:43| and coming not just once a day but multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| So I think that this provision, as written or proposed, is overbroad because you're not trying to stop somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5927)|
| 1:38:56| from writing a letter as connected to their business because that has no impact as to any exterior neighborhood relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5936)|
| 1:39:08| It's only when it has an impact for neighborhood relationships that governmental intrusion is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5948)|
| 1:39:16| And I would recommend that the language of the home occupation include this idea of commercial activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5956)|
| 1:39:26| which requires persons coming to the house or coming to the residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| and otherwise potentially disturbing the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| That's where it becomes a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| Before then or after then, the whole discussion of me typing a memorandum of law at the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5978)|
| 1:39:47| should not be a governmental interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Another comment, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| Sandra Korbelik, 5212 Daphne Drive, Building Height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| Building height is referenced in Section 2.E.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6004)|
| 1:40:13| What page? Say this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Well, I have draft 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| It reads measured from grade of the front of the building line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| And I question what is the definition of grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| Is it existing? Is it finished? Is it as measured from the street right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| And then building line, is it point by point or is it an average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| I just don't understand the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| And it's page 2. or 2-32, Section E, in the middle of that page, references building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6047)|
| 1:40:54| 2-32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| 2-32, Section E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6056)|
| 1:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| So 2-32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| E.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| It's just I've seen people who have, you know, beefed up a finished grade so they could have a taller building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| And I just wonder how the city measures building height from grade since grade is not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6077)|
| 1:41:25| Peter, can you discuss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| I'm not familiar with folks that are just building up the grade next to the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| I believe we just look at it's going to be a, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6097)|
| 1:41:48| Looking at one of your folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| What do you call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| You need a lifeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| Calling in our lifeline here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| We just look at it from the front of the structure and we measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| But obviously, I'm thinking of scenarios such as like Cumberland where you've got a grade differential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6123)|
| 1:42:14| I would imagine we would measure from the area where it's the tallest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| So if on the west side it's taller than the east side due to the grade differential, we would measure the taller of the two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6139)|
| 1:42:28| Well, I thought of that and I wondered if that was fair since you're not taking an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| The way I would look at it is the building height is intended, especially on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| We want to have a pedestrian-friendly district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| And building height comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| And as a pedestrian walking down the sidewalk, you're not going to say, oh, that's a tall building because of the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6166)|
| 1:42:54| It's what stairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| Yeah, I know, but where are you measuring from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Is it an average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| I mean, I didn't know if it was fair to the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| You can do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6187)|
| 1:43:16| Apparently, we are measuring the average based out of the current zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6196)|
| 1:43:33| It's one of those little things that can make a really big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| No, thank you for bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| And I actually don't need an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| I just wanted to raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| I think it would be appropriate to add language in E if we want to be consistent with the current ordinance to basically add language to average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6225)|
| 1:43:54| Okay, I want to suggest, do you want to do this now or do you want them to bring this back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| You can bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| Okay, if you would bring it back, add that where we want to bring back on May 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| just to take note that we will be clear about how we determine building height, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6245)|
| 1:44:15| Thank you, Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| Danny Kirby, 6332 Bomb Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| I'd like us to take a closer look at the definition for public safety facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| The way it reads now, it basically says a facility operated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| and for the use of public safety agencies such as fire department and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| And there's the including the dispatch, storage, maintenance of police and fire vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| Gerald and I have traded some e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| I think he was under the impression it was just police buildings and fire department, fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6289)|
| 1:44:57| The way I read that, I don't believe that's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| and it's important because it's allowed in every zone, all the residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| a public safety facility is allowed as a special use and in every commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| So I think it's important that we know exactly what a public safety facility consists of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| That's what I would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| So you're not suggesting it change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Oh, no, I think it does need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| I think right now it's pretty vague as to what a public safety facility is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| When it says such as a police department or fire department, it could mean other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6326)|
| 1:45:33| It says a facility operated by and for the use of public safety agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6333)|
| 1:45:42| I just think that that ought to be further defined to mean police department or fire station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| not all public safety agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| And, in fact, I would probably go as far as to say, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| this even says public safety facilities include shelter and training facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| for canine and equine units of public safety agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| and those are allowed as special uses in the residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| So I just think that needs to be cleaned up so everybody knows what can possibly come into their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| and as a commercial developer or property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| you know what can go next to you when it comes to public safety facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| And I've pointed this out to Gerald as well, that public safety facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| although allowed in all the commercial zones and the residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| are not allowed in institutional zones for some reason, which doesn't seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| So I think we're taking a look at that portion of it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| So I'd look for direction from council on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| I have a question about it when we get to page 9-5, if we want to try and stay in order when we get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| When we get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| We'll come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Would you like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| What Mr. Kirby said would be, in that first sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| a facility operated for and use of public safety agencies limited to fire departments and police stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6413)|
| 1:47:00| I think that would address Mr. Kirby's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| Another note is that in the residential districts, it is a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| so there would be a review by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| They could address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| I'm not sure I'd like to think about the K-9 and equine training facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6433)|
| 1:47:19| and come to you on the 30th with something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| But the first step would be to state limited to fire department and police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| And I guess I would just ask you to consider, I mean, if you have KEMA, you have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| there are other public safety agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| We should really consider what all of them are and not automatically just limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| I mean, as you're thinking about this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| I don't think I have an issue with ones being specifically stated in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| I think it just needs to be made clear as to what's allowed as public safety agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6472)|
| 1:48:01| Okay, so they will look at this and try to see if there's a further clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| but we need to consider what public agencies may need to be housed in these different zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6485)|
| 1:48:12| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Carleen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| So this comes under the heading that there's no bigger waste of time than appeals of interpretations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| where you can tie up for 500 bucks, you can tie up a project for three or six months, and nobody wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6503)|
| 1:48:31| And, you know, there's never a good reason to do it except we didn't write things clearly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| So I would ask under page 2-1, Article 2, Section 2.1, Rules of Interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6518)|
| 1:48:45| that we add back in, and this is in the weed stuff, the words person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| Person includes a firm, partnership, or corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| 2-1 where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| Article 2, Section 2.1, Rules of Interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| So what has been deleted from the existing ordinance are the following two clarifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6545)|
| 1:49:12| and I think they're important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| One of them says a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| The word person includes a firm, partnership, or corporation, as well as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| So wherever the ordinance says person, it means all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| And the other is the word, quote, used, or, quote, occupied, as applied to any land or building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6566)|
| 1:49:35| shall be construed to include the words, quote, intended, arranged, or designed to be used, or occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| And, again, I've been around long enough, you know, where we've had interpretation questions and appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6583)|
| 1:49:51| that basically get you how many angels are there on the head of the pin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| And the clearer we can be in this document, the better off future councils will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| and every property owner of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| And for that reason, I think it's important to include these definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6605)|
| 1:50:11| and I don't understand why they were omitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| Do we know why they were omitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| So can we add that on the list of things to look back at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| Is there a reason why we have them omitted here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| That would be something to look into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| Will we come back to that, or do you need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| We don't need a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| I think we just want to know before we would vote whether to put it back in or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| So I'd ask them to take a look at it and see whether it's something that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| You do recommend to get back in, or if not, why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| So that's on two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| I'm having a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| How about y'all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| We've got some water for counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| Yeah, and remind counsel, we will have something to eat here in a little over an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6663)|
| 1:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| So let's work up an appetite here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Mary, if I can have just one second to save all these so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| To save them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Okay, yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| So what we want is we have it all on tape, so it won't be lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6681)|
| 1:51:35| but it will be a lot easier not having to retype it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| So next we are moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| And next when she gets that saved, we will be on Article 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| So we'll give everybody a chance to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| That's just a two-pager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Yes, and Draft 5 has no revisions to Article 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| This deals with just identifying zoning districts and the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6713)|
| 1:51:59| establishment of the zoning map, and interpretation of boundary lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| Okay, so you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| You're on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Okay, so Article 3, zoning districts and zoning maps, no changes in this draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| Are there any discussions about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| Not even a full two-page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Not even a full two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| So are there any comments from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| Larry Dearing, 200 Adair Drive in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| And I would like to address the minimum lot size proposed under RN1 and RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| Could somebody help me on a page number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| That's in Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Okay, we're going to get to that in just a second, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Okay, don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| And remind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| I want to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| Okay, Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| We're now on Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6771)|
| 1:53:01| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| Just an observation on Article 3, Carlene Malone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| and I think it becomes important as you look at the zoning districts coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| You'll notice, for instance, there are five subzones for downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6796)|
| 1:53:25| which is a fairly small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| And it acknowledges, those five subdistricts acknowledge the small differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6807)|
| 1:53:38| that exist among those five downtown Knoxville areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6818)|
| 1:53:45| What you have in residential, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| and I think this is why so many of the suburban neighborhoods feel they've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| basically, short change, short shrift, back of the hand on the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| All single family detached neighborhoods, R1, R1A, R1E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6838)|
| 1:54:10| have been squeezed into two zoning districts, R1 and R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6850)|
| 1:54:17| Okay, that's what we're going to talk about in four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| And that's, okay, just as an observation, where you have here the zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6859)|
| 1:54:27| keep that, please, keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| Okay, thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Okay, now we're on Article 4, Residential Neighborhood Districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| Starts on page 4-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| So, Gerald, what, and we do have a staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| Let's talk about other changes, and we'll get to the, that's in this document here already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6884)|
| 1:54:50| The first change is on page 4-1 in Section 4.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6890)|
| 1:54:57| The neighborhoods, residential neighborhood districts are defined as low density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| medium density, or high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| And that was in response to public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| And on page 4.2, clarification of RV bodies and standards for townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6909)|
| 1:55:15| and multifamily dwellings in the RN4 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| That's Section 4.2.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| In Table 4.1, there's clarification of the front setback in the RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| That's on page 4.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| Wait a minute, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| Okay, on 4-2, are there any questions about that under 4.2 uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| Did we straighten out on 4.2B, the may or may require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6937)|
| 1:55:45| Yeah, I think I was told to get some comments in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| You were told what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6948)|
| 1:55:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| Did you get that answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| We're actually looking at those at May, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| That's one of the things we're looking at, the use of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| So 4.2, I just, is it possible, or I think it could be warranted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6975)|
| 1:56:23| could the delineations here between 1 and 2, is it possible to maybe put those into a chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6983)|
| 1:56:30| It's nothing elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| How about, you know, in my spare time, I could see if it's, I'm not trying to make work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| I just think it's slightly confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| Where are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| 4.2B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| Okay, between 1 and 2 there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| We'll look at that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| And you're asking for a chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| I'm just looking to see if there's a more clear way to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Clear a way to represent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| You all have that, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| Then there's 4.3, three-dimensional standards, no changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| We get to Table 4-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| And there's a staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| There's a staff recommendation on the plot size for two-family dwellings or duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| and the RN-2, RN-3, and RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| And this results, the Planning Commission discussed this during their workshops and their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| Also, the City Council at one of your workshops had a straw poll on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| And to be quite honest, when I get a straw poll, I don't know what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| Is that mandatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| Is that what you wish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| So what I need is confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| What we need now is confirmation on the lot sizes for two-family and RN-2, RN-3, and RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7078)|
| 1:58:05| What staff is recommending is that in RN-2, the lot size for a two-family go to 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7085)|
| 1:58:12| and RN-3, 7,500 square feet, and RN-4, 7,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7092)|
| 1:58:18| This creates a hierarchy of lot sizes for two-family dwellings in those zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| that are compatible with the or have some relationship to the lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7103)|
| 1:58:29| minimum lot size for single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| And they still provide opportunities for two-family dwelling development in all those zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7112)|
| 1:58:40| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| So I will clarify for my colleagues here, if you guys recall at the last workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| the dimensions here in the chart on 4-3 in the fifth draft do not reflect what we agreed to in the straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7126)|
| 1:58:58| I was very, there were, neighborhoods in my district were the ones asking for those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| because a lot of the single-family housing in my district got zoned higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| They got up-zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| And my concern is things basically becoming, they get a bullseye on the back for demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7153)|
| 1:59:24| and the ground beneath them becomes more valuable than the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| This particularly becomes a problem with shotgun houses, houses that aren't in good condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7168)|
| 1:59:34| smaller houses, working class houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| This is something that you see in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| And that was where my concern came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| In meeting with different neighborhood groups in my district with different philosophies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| and meeting with Director Green, based on changes to the map, which I believe there was an amendment to the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7187)|
| 1:59:55| which I haven't gotten a copy of, but we've sat and had some discussions with different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| I'm amenable with those constituents to what Director Green just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| which is 10,000 in two-family, R and 2 for two-family, 7,500 in R and 3 for two-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7206)|
| 2:00:15| That was the sticking point at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| And then R and 4, two-family, 7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Because I made pencil notations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| And these are based on not up-zoning single-family housing to high density in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7227)|
| 2:00:35| That's one of the things that we've discussed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| The other thing here that I emailed Director Green about last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| and I believe Mr. Dearing, who just tried to come to the mic, is going to probably speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7243)|
| 2:00:50| is I'm concerned for areas like Adair Gardens, Sanders Drive, I may have said that incorrectly, Rose Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7250)|
| 2:00:59| Those are very fragile areas that have fought off commercial encroachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| They're sandwiched between two highly-traveled commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| They've fought off a large grocery store in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| We have parcels there that are zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| They range from 17,000 to 30,000 square feet with single-family, working-class, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7275)|
| 2:01:22| And they've now been zoned to R and 2, which puts them at 5,000 square feet lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7282)|
| 2:01:27| This is a way to get these houses demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| And that's my concern is, is there a missing zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| And that was my question to Director Green in my email last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| Is there a missing zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| Because we make a leap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| E-N is 22,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| R and 1 is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| And then R and 2 falls down to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| I just don't feel that we're doing those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| Those are stable, and we can destabilize them with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| And they're working-class, affordable housing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| So I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| And if Director Green wants to speak to that, he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| I don't know if the solution is to just zone them R and 1, which is what they were in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| They were R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| Or if there's something missing or there's some other way to skin the cat and not put them in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| Just looking at the map quickly, that's one area where when we mapped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| and a lot of this was done by our GIS staff who looked at the smallest lot in an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7348)|
| 2:02:36| or if there were two or three, and their approach was not to create non-conforming lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7356)|
| 2:02:42| So if there were two or three smaller lots, for better or worse, that dictated the zoning for that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| So there were a couple 6,000-square-foot lots in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7368)|
| 2:02:52| So the designation was R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| Maybe a better approach is to, since those lots are currently non-conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| with a minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet, zone it R and 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| because the majority of the lots would be compatible or conforming under R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| And that would offer even more safety than creating a mid-range district of 7,000 or 7,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7390)|
| 2:03:18| because a 17,000-square-foot lot could be divided into two 7,500-square-foot lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| or it could not be divided into two 10,000-square-foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| So I think the R and 1 designation in that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| may be the most viable tool for protecting the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7410)|
| 2:03:37| Anybody else have a comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| I think this is where you've got to see the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| I mean, we're trying to make rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| We don't know where the map is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| So it depends on if you pull the map back, then that might all be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| Until you know where that is, it's kind of hard to pinpoint that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| I've noted it when we discussed the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| So her third option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| So we've got to hold on to that and keep that front and center when we're talking about the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| So her third option is to make it zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| Then these issues may or may not be in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| I think that's kind of hard to know that until you really see what the map is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7447)|
| 2:04:17| Is that good with you, Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| So I guess, A, if you have areas in your district that have the same issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| I'm saying that it's up to us to look at that to protect our neighborhoods so we don't lose our housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7471)|
| 2:04:38| And I think one thing we sometimes lose track of is every single-family residential district now has a lot size of 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7478)|
| 2:04:46| We've heard lots of issues that you're making my minimum lot size 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| And that's a concern for the residents of certain neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| But their minimum lot size now is 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| And I think we're making them viable or available for subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| We need to step back a minute and remember where we are now, where we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| instead of where we think we are and where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| We need to look at times, just look at our existing zoning code and see where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| and not that imaginary place where there are bluebirds singing and butterflies and the sun is always shining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7515)|
| 2:05:21| because we have challenges throughout the community that are addressed more readily with our new zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7521)|
| 2:05:27| than with our current or proposed zoning code than with our current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| Well, that's important to bring that up whenever we're in this discussion, where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| But, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| Is that fine for when, as we're looking at the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| Yeah, I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| I thought somebody was mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| Like I said, we're having a great time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| By the way, I've ordered six extra pizzas, so y'all can eat when the pizzas come too, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| It's on my tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| Personal tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| I just want to say this conversation may come up when we look at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| And I reserve, and maybe we need to consider that we are discussing this when we look at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7565)|
| 2:06:12| Mayor, I'd like to comment on what Councilperson Ryder had just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| One thing we've talked about in this area in residential before is about how RN1 is a combination of R1, R1A, and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7577)|
| 2:06:28| And I think some of what was just mentioned is how the infrastructure is different in those different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7588)|
| 2:06:36| And so your point about whether we need another residential zoning I think is a legitimate thing to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7596)|
| 2:06:43| We've talked about it before in previous workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| It hadn't gotten a whole lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| But I would certainly think that the infrastructural differences in all of those areas is really hard to combine into one zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7607)|
| 2:06:55| And so adding another zone would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7615)|
| 2:07:04| Okay, so we're going to keep this in mind as we move forward and look at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| Does anyone want to make a motion on the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| Yeah, we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| Okay, before we were on the minimum lot areas, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| If you look on this sheet, number two, revise the minimum lot area for all references to duplexes basically as follows, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7639)|
| 2:07:33| That's what we've already discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| Did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| Does anyone from the community want to speak to that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| Okay, Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| Do you have a motion and a second on that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| Are we on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| Do I have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Thanks for keeping me on track, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| Bob Wetzel, 1015 Lutzville Street, 4th and Gill Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| and several other meetings discussing the idea of having a 10,000 square foot minimum for duplexes in R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7679)|
| 2:08:08| And this kind of moves away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| And we met in 4th and Gill last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| We are okay with the amendment as proposed here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| Just understand that that will mean that we are going to be requesting when we get back to the maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| that there will be more R and 2 requested for 4th and Gill than R and 3, probably about a two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| It goes back to development patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| That part of the neighborhood that was developed before 1850 has some smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| So they're kind of fine with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| So, anyway, know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| So we're supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| And I would also just like to make, this makes a really good point on why we need to get the wording right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| and then come back and do the maps once we know what rules to apply to what sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| So I think you're all on the right track in thinking that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| And we're happy to have 5,000 square foot minimum lots in R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| because that's pretty much the size of half the lots in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7738)|
| 2:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| Sir, did you want to speak until you come up before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| And then Commissioner, is that Commissioner Gill back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| You'll be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| Larry Deering, 200 Adair Drive, Knoxville, Adair Gardens in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| And I want to thank Councilwoman Ryder and Mr. Green for covering a lot of the points that I was going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| The original draft for Recode Knoxville called for 7,000 square foot minimum for R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| This draft has 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| And the lots do range in size in Adair Gardens from 7,000 to over 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| And if a 15,000 square foot property could be divided in three houses built on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7780)|
| 2:09:46| it would totally change the character, the livability, the desirability of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| 5,000 square feet minimum lot size in that neighborhood would definitely be a blueprint for destruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7791)|
| 2:10:00| All we're asking for here is to keep what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| It's worked since 1928.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| So that could be accomplished either by restoring the 7,000 square foot minimum lot size to R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7806)|
| 2:10:13| or proposing that Adair Gardens be under R and 1 instead of R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7813)|
| 2:10:19| Because the minimum lot size in the proposed R and 1 is 7,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| And I like anchovies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| I like anchovies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| I'm not sure if there's anchovies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| And I don't know how far that pizza is going to go, but you all are going to have to share, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7836)|
| 2:10:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| Thank you and good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| I'm Commissioner Evelyn Gill and I'm at 2504 Linden Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| And I just simply wanted to advocate for the R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| We live on three, what is three city lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| So we have a large piece of property and I think some of the zoning under R2 would negatively impact the area in which we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7852)|
| 2:10:59| So the consideration for that is a welcome change because there are specific pieces of property that have extended lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7859)|
| 2:11:08| and this would impact us in a negative manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| So I'm here to help advocate for R1 and not the R2 designation in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7870)|
| 2:11:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| So right now we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| I'm talking to the next one, Evelyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| So we have a motion right now on the minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| Do you want to discuss that, Elizabeth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7891)|
| 2:11:32| Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| My name is Sarah Elizabeth Rowland, 615 Balsam Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| I'm here with the Knox County Democratic Party Progressive Action Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| The PAC agrees that the minimum lot sizes for duplexes should progressively increase from larger to smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7903)|
| 2:11:50| as you move from RN2 to RN4 as proposed in the Planning Commission's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7910)|
| 2:11:55| That reflects the concept that suburban zones have bigger lots and as you progress higher in center city zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7915)|
| 2:12:03| that you have more density in smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| We can support increasing the duplex minimum lot size for RN2 to 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| and lowering the duplex minimum lot size for RN3 and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| However, we urge council to make sure there are more lots designated on the map as RN3 and 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7934)|
| 2:12:21| because right now there are very few and this will particularly be a problem if we revert to zone neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7941)|
| 2:12:29| because as you all know there is no zone RN4 or 3 on our current zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7949)|
| 2:12:38| We suggest that vacant lots in the city center, the heart of Knoxville, be identified to zone as RN3 and 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7958)|
| 2:12:46| so that we can avoid the concern of teardowns while still ensuring missing middle housing within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7966)|
| 2:12:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| Carleen, did I see you wanting to speak to that minimum lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| Yes, Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| I certainly agree with the increase in the square footage for two family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7988)|
| 2:13:15| I want to get back to something Councilman Ryder said and something Mr. Green said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| having to do with lot size for single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=7999)|
| 2:13:25| And for decades, Knoxville's minimum lot size for single family in R1, R1E, R1A, and R2 were 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8005)|
| 2:13:36| What happens when you say you have to be 10,000 square feet or 5,000 square feet with nothing in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8016)|
| 2:13:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| When you have nothing around 7,000, it means all of these properties that for all of these decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8028)|
| 2:13:58| were developed around 7,500, the legal minimum lot size, which are many for single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8038)|
| 2:14:08| suddenly become R and 2 because they can't make the 10,000 square foot minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8048)|
| 2:14:17| So suddenly you have all this housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| Adair Gardens is an excellent example, but there are examples across this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| where they were developed at 7,500 and now they're 5 because they're not going to be 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| And that whole drag of all of this housing to 5,000 may be a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8070)|
| 2:14:37| but it may also set up the economic conditions, the incentives for the destruction of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8077)|
| 2:14:45| and the character of our neighborhoods because the land, as Councilman Ryder points out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8085)|
| 2:14:53| the land is worth more than the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| I'm not sure that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| And usually if you look at Nashville and other places, the housing that has replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| when the lots of houses demolished and lots subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8105)|
| 2:15:10| the housing that has replaced the existing housing is more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| It's not providing affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| It's providing more expensive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| So let's be very careful and begin to have some appreciation of the number of housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8119)|
| 2:15:27| that we're moving because they can't meet 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| Maybe we need to go back to the 7,000 for R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| Maybe we need a zone in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| But we need to look carefully at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| Again, as I said earlier, we're taking all single-family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| The city of Knoxville, unless they're on 22,000 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8142)|
| 2:15:48| was crowding all of them into two zoning districts, R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8148)|
| 2:15:56| And then, as Elizabeth just said, we don't have many R3, R4, and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8156)|
| 2:16:03| but we have zones proposed, R and 3, R and 4, R and 5, R and 6, R and 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8163)|
| 2:16:10| for a very small amount of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| I think this needs to be seriously looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| Any other public comment on minimum lot size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| I'm sorry, Councilwoman St. Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| Between what Councilperson Ryder said and then what Elizabeth Rowland brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| I don't want the destruction of houses and the land to be more valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| but what about the empty lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| If there is a space that's already available and a duplex can be built on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| that provides two affordable homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| So I'm not sure how we can make distinctions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| So in meetings, I've had meetings with Elizabeth Rowland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| I've had meetings with Representative Wetzel from Forth and Gill and Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8214)|
| 2:17:01| The neighborhood there was upzoned entirely to R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| and we went through a compromise process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| and we picked the areas with the most green lots, buildable lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| Some of the owners of the buildable lots asked for R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| There's also been emailed to me today one area that's developable, green land, empty space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8237)|
| 2:17:24| The owners asked for, I think, a CG designation or a CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8248)|
| 2:17:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| Because there are more uses than what's allowed in R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| It's that plus some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| So we looked at the map and went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| and versus a broad brush of the whole neighborhood becomes one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| we looked at this is the old school is empty green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| That's been, I think that's R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| So we went through and we looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| and this is conversations I've had with both groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| to look at where is developable land and where is existing housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| because we're not doing ourselves a favor by zoning existing housing for something that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8279)|
| 2:18:06| Because if you demolish it and make it something else, it's not going to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| I'm not buying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| It's just not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| And so we went through and we looked with a fine-tooth comb at those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| And, again, when we get to the map, we can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| And I encourage you all to look at your areas if that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| And if I may add, we've received comments from some community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| about the approach of just designating vacant lots as R and 3 and R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8311)|
| 2:18:37| And there's some pushback on that because of the impact that could have on a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| if you had a number of vacant lots in the center of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| There are gardens and they were zoned for duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| and that may not be in keeping with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| So taking a longer-range, more strategic approach to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| Ms. Malone said we have R and 3 and R and 4 that aren't used much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| This is where we look at our vision for the longer-term future of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| We have those tools that are available for those property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| So in the future, the city, the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| or the neighborhood can initiate a rezoning of those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| We now have the tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| We can't think of this as something that is just for today only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8355)|
| 2:19:21| It's that vision of what we want our city to be in 10, 15, or 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| and providing the tools for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| So some of these zoning categories are not used a great deal now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| but they provide an opportunity for us to meet needs in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| and provide options that we do not have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| Right. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| It just seems like there's some things that we are planning ahead for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| that we may not have a need for right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| and then other things that we're saying if the need arises, we can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| But some of each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| It's balancing those and keeping in mind that this is a dynamic document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| The map is dynamic, and we have the option to change those as the needs change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| I can't predict the future, and I don't know that Peter can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| although working with him, I've found that, well, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| the three to my right are much smarter than me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| and I don't know that they can predict the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| But we need to keep in mind, provide those tools we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| anticipating the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| but also acknowledging that we will need to revisit this from time to time to adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| Are you going to speak to this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| Yes, very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| I wanted to just follow up on what Councilwoman Ryder said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| We are really happy with the help she's provided to work with Forth and Gill and us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8434)|
| 2:20:41| and I understand Bill Morris did a similar process on their own when they submitted their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8441)|
| 2:20:47| We'd like to see that kind of thing happen across the city center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8447)|
| 2:20:54| because those are just two neighborhoods and it's not comprehensive enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| And we also hope that we can make as much progress in this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| because if it's postponed to a future date, and I understand it's a living document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8462)|
| 2:21:08| but it's hard for individuals, especially people that have full-time jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| to maintain this level of activity in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| So we'd like to get it right the first time if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| Any other discussions on Table 4.1, revising the minimum lot area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| Councilman Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| So you're going to vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| This is what you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| As it's written, I'm not going to support the 10,000 square foot NRN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8491)|
| 2:21:37| I would propose leaving it at 7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| You know, with that, I think it really plays to the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8501)|
| 2:21:48| And when we get back on 9.4 or 9.3 and we talk about permitted and special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8508)|
| 2:21:55| you know, I'm going to talk about whether NRN3, it would be a special use or permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| and I'm going to suggest that it be a special use and not a permitted use for this very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| So at least you have buy-in from the community or buy-in from your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| So based on that, I'm not going to support taking NRN2 to 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8529)|
| 2:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| Just one clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| I have a note, and it could be wrong, but the current NRN2, the current equivalent, is it at 10,000 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8544)|
| 2:22:33| R1A, it's 10,000, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8556)|
| 2:22:37| Just FYI, that is what the current equivalent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| You may still not like it, but I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| I think the ability to have mixed types of houses is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8561)|
| 2:22:49| And I like the duplexes, and I think given the ñ still don't have many people that want to build them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8569)|
| 2:22:55| and they're still ñ but I think it gives you options that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| I think you need that mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8581)|
| 2:23:02| Councilwoman Ryder, did you want to respond to that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| Well, I was going to do some math because I feel like we talked about this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| So a 50-foot wide lot times ñ so the last time, I'm going to have to go back in my memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8589)|
| 2:23:19| but the last time we discussed this, when we did the straw poll at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| there are lots of lots, particularly on my street, that are well over the ñ yeah, they're over the 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| The same thing with Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| Where did Mr. Wetzel go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| Back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| We identified there are lots that get zoned R and 2 that are eligible for the 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8616)|
| 2:23:43| So I don't know if you want to comment on that, but it doesn't preclude ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| Yeah, a couple of comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| First of all, currently in R1A, it is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| Going back to zoning neutral, R and 2 is the closest thing out there to R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| So I would argue we keep it at 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| In the R and 2 portion of the neighborhood, there are probably ñ I think there are 15 or 16 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| that would be eligible for subdivision into duplexes where you would have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| These would be lots with historic structures on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| And that's what we've really been concerned with trying to preserve, historic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| We lived through a period when they all got subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| and we brought them all back, or not all of them, but a number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| So that's what we're actually trying to preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| So there are lot sizes with buildings on them that are 10,000, 12,000, 14,000 square feet in Forth and Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8666)|
| 2:24:34| that you could build duplexes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| And in the R and 3 section, proposed R and 3 section, where most of the vacant lots are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8676)|
| 2:24:41| there are five or six lots that are above the 7,500 square foot limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8681)|
| 2:24:47| that you could build duplexes on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| But once again, they're all occupied by historic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| What you've seen with what we've done in Forth and Gill is take the south end of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| where there are the smaller lots, but the most vacant structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| and say that's good for R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| North of Lavinia would be R and 2 because most of the lots there are 7,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| but there are many that are more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| Typically it's 50 by 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| When they sold them out in the 1880s, 1890s, sometimes people got 75 by 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| Sometimes people got 100 by 150, kind of like it goes on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| So I would very much encourage you to keep the 10,000 square feet as a duplex minimum in R and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8719)|
| 2:25:25| 7,500 in R and 3, and the 7,000 in R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8725)|
| 2:25:29| That's kind of where this process started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| We kind of threw it a curveball and put it in a different direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| but it's come back to where it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| I think it's a good place for it to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| I just will point out that R and 2 and R and 3 both are single family, 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| There's differentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| Of course, there's townhouses, and I don't think there's multifamily in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8746)|
| 2:25:52| But the difference is two family is 10,000 is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| The amendment is 10,000 in R and 2 and 7,500 in R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8756)|
| 2:26:02| And this was something that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| If somebody has a lot and they want to build a duplex, they go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| It's a zoning neutral thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| And they can go and pay their fee and put a sign out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| and ask for a zone to R and 3 to be able to do a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8774)|
| 2:26:19| Yeah, so what's being proposed is it be a permitted use, not a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| I would suggest that in R and 3 it ought to be a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| And so R and 1, 2, and 3 would be a special use and not a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8788)|
