| 0:00:30| This meeting to order our moment of silence and Pledge of Allegiance will be led by Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| Please stand for a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=35)|
| 0:00:53| Please face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=53)|
| 0:00:55| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=55)|
| 0:01:16| To continue our emphasis on our vision and mission, I thought I would take a couple of moments at each meeting to explore the meaning and provide clarity around these statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=76)|
| 0:01:28| Our vision is to grow lifelong learners who contribute their talents, strengths, and skills to build a stronger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=88)|
| 0:01:36| I've discovered several definitions of lifelong learner, or lifelong learning, and wanted to share a favorite one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| Lifelong learning is the ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated pursuit of knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| I definitely want all of our students to have that passion for knowledge, and I'm glad that our vision includes that reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=108)|
| 0:01:57| We'll continue to look at this more closely as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| Our board will meet in quarterly work session on Wednesday, October 28th at 5 p.m. in this boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| And we look forward to receiving our annual legislative update from our class representatives with Millsaps-Gowan Government Relations at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=130)|
| 0:02:18| As Superintendent Thomas announced at our work session last week, Knox County Schools will be offering families the opportunity to switch their learning model between virtual and in-person between Monday, October 26th and Friday, November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=138)|
| 0:02:37| Families who are happy with their current learning model will not need to do anything, but those wishing to make a change will be asked to do so using an online form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=157)|
| 0:02:48| More detail will be shared soon, so be sure to look for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| Finally, next week, October 12th through the 16th, is Knox County Schools' fall break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| And I'm sure that the board will join me in wishing all of our students, families, and staff a very restful and very well-deserved break, more so than any other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=178)|
| 0:03:10| So, with that, do we have any changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=190)|
| 0:03:23| Okay. Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| We have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Ms. Christie. Any discussion? All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| And today, I would like to refer now to Superintendent Bob Thomas, and he will have the next portion of our agenda. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=220)|
| 0:03:51| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. The fun things we get to do. Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| We like to take a few minutes and recognize, make sure that we recognize the tremendous achievements that have happened this year, so far this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=236)|
| 0:04:03| And this is early in the year, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| But first, I had the privilege of going to Carnes Middle School on September 9th to celebrate with Mrs. Kami Lunsford, who was named Tennessee Teacher of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=245)|
| 0:04:14| My goodness. Tennessee Teacher of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| As you may have seen, Education Commissioner Dr. Penny Schwinn presented Mrs. Lunsford with the award, and it was a great opportunity to highlight her achievements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=256)|
| 0:04:28| I think you also got a check for $3,000, I believe, too, so that doesn't hurt matters at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| For those of you who've never met Mrs. Lunsford, she's an example of the enthusiasm, the passion, and the innovative thinking that happens in classrooms across our district every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=274)|
| 0:04:44| Officially, Mrs. Lunsford is a chorus teacher, but her students also get to use instruments like guitars, ukuleles, and drums in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=284)|
| 0:04:53| That kind of unique instruction is crucial for keeping students engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| And we're very proud of Mrs. Lunsford's creativity on behalf of her students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| And at this time, we'd like to present an award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| I'd like for the whole board, since Mrs. Lunsford is a Tennessee Teacher of the Year, to get in the photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| So if we could all get in the photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| And Brent's here, too, so there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=311)|
| 0:05:38| All right, here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=338)|
| 0:06:03| One, two, three, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=363)|
| 0:06:16| So I just wanted to take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=376)|
| 0:06:46| To thank you for the honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| And I'm going to try to do this and not be emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| But thank you for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| I feel super honored right now, as you can imagine, a little over-honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| Every teacher should get this award this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| We should be in buses, knocking on doors, and handing out checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| But it's funny, I do want to share with you my thoughts and just some positivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=428)|
| 0:07:20| Because I know your lives have been as hectic as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| And so I just want to share, like, up to the minute, while he was talking, my heart started to race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| And I'm a music teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| I'm a performance teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| I teach kids how to perform under pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| And that heart racing that just happened was not the nerves because I'm about to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| or I'm about to have a picture taken or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| It was pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| I want to share with you that in March, it felt a lot like a natural disaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| when we got unplugged from our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| And for the whole spring break, y'all let us enjoy our spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| We didn't get a single email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Now, we weren't enjoying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| I was biting my nails the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| But still, no email and no expectations and nothing crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| And then the first time we heard a direction from the board and from Bob Thomas and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| it was we're concerned about kids eating and being safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| And that's when I was proud, way before I got this fancy award, that I was a teacher at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| especially during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| So thank you, Bob Thomas, for the hard work that I know that is happening in your office all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| And for you all for bearing the weight for what's going on, what a time to be alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| I say that all the time and usually sarcastically, but especially here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| I'm super proud to be with Knox County during this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| during this most important time for education and for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=553)|
| 0:09:21| Thank you, Cammie, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| And she does speak for many teachers in Knox County, and that's very sweet to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| And she's a great representative for teachers this year, and I'm very proud of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| So, Mr. Thomas, we'll turn it over to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| And the second exciting event that happened last month was at Sarah Moore Green Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| which was recognized as a school of promise by the National Institute for Excellence in Teaching, NIET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| And is Robin still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Robin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Robin, get in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| If you're team, yeah, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Come on, team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| So we took a picture earlier, but just to get the team in front of the board here so while we recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=603)|
| 0:10:12| Sarah Moore Green is just one of two schools in the whole country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| one of two in the whole United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| and NIET is honoring as a school of promise this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| And I believe, Robin, you got a check from NIET for $5,000, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| And I think they challenged you to go for the $50,000 check that's next, the next award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| So what they'll be going for is the $50,000 check in the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| But this distinction recognizes early success in implementing NIET initiatives to improve teaching and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| After consecutive years of level one student achievement growth, the school earned level five in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| That's the highest growth rating possible in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| While testing was suspended this spring, NIET and Sarah Moore Green continued to model a spirit of collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| and innovation throughout the COVID-19 transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| So congratulations, Robin and team Sarah Moore Green for your accomplishments and have a certificate for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=669)|
| 0:11:17| And thank you for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=679)|
| 0:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Thank you all so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Again, this has been a very challenging year, but these recognitions show that our teachers, principals and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| are continuing to do outstanding work, even in difficult circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| So thanks to Ms. Lunford and Ms. Curry for all the work that they do for our students and their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Thank you all so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| And even with the difficult circumstances, it's so nice to have things to celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| And we do have a fantastic district with wonderful teachers and leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| And so we're all very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| It's fun to celebrate for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Okay, board members, before the reading of the voting items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| I wanted to note that our board committee and role appointments for 2020-2021 are part of the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| Thank you all for your willingness to serve our district in each of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Also, you have a copy at the table of a memorandum from me regarding item 11B and the appointment of a special question committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| A copy of the memorandum is also attached to the electronic agenda for the public's reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| Dr. Russell is here this evening if there are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| But I did want to let you know that he has confirmed to the board office that over 15% of our professional educators have expressed an interest in collaborative conferencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=763)|
| 0:12:53| So we will need to finalize this appointment this evening in order to hold a first committee meeting the week after fall break to meet the timeline requirements under PECA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=773)|
| 0:13:04| Finally, you received an email communication from Superintendent Thomas regarding his recommendation that we cover the entire cost of the increase on health care on the health insurance premiums effective January 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=784)|
| 0:13:19| An additional attachment was added to the electronic agenda reflecting that new detail for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| Superintendent Thomas can speak to that item or answer any questions about that when it's read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| But I wanted to make sure that we note that for the public's benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=811)|

| 0:16:44| Mr. Watson. That's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| No worries. You've been saying Owen a lot, so it's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| I have. It's fine. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Yes, thank you. Mr. Dupler, just for the public, the language in line 8 and 9 around a child abuse coordinator was really added out of changes in the law, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1012)|
| 0:17:05| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| Yes, absolutely. Child abuse coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| The law was changed this summer from the Tennessee legislature, and they mandated – the legislature mandated a child abuse coordinator be named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1034)|
| 0:17:24| Yes. I think it's important whenever we're setting policy that names roles in schools that we also have a mechanism in that policy to ensure accountability to that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1044)|
| 0:17:35| And I don't think it needs to be anything hard and fast, but I would like to recommend after discussion an amended motion to add some language to that to ensure some accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1055)|
| 0:17:47| Do we have any other comment? Okay. Would you like to offer a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| It's an amendment to the motion. Is that correct, Mr. Dupler? Is it the way I'm doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| You could do either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| I want to go for amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| Okay. Yeah. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| We're going to try that one out. I don't get to hear that one a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| So my amendment to the motion is that in line nine, it would read after the sentence about the child abuse and alternative child abuse coordinators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1087)|
| 0:18:16| It says the director of school culture shall maintain a list of child abuse and alternative child abuse coordinators, including the name of each school and assigned coordinators throughout Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1096)|
| 0:18:26| This list shall be updated annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1106)|
| 0:18:35| Did everybody get? Yeah. Can you? Yeah. Okay. Let me pull this thing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Okay. So hold on one second. So we're on line nine. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| I believe that's correct. Let's see. It would be. Yes. Line nine after the sentence that says alternative child abuse coordinator before when a report is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1122)|
| 0:18:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| So it would say the director of school culture shall maintain a list of child abuse and alternative child abuse coordinators, including the name of each school and assigned coordinators throughout Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1132)|
| 0:19:03| This list shall be updated annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Do you see any issue with that amendment, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Not at all, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Do we have a we need a second on that? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Okay. So we have a an amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| We have a second by Miss Satterfield discussion on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| Okay. All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Any opposed. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1172)|
| 0:19:41| That amends the motion, but now you need to have a have a vote on the actual motion complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| The amended with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Do we have the original motion was made by Miss Owen and seconded by Miss Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| So if there's no, is there any other discussion or question on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| I have a question on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Was it updated annually or at least annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| Updated annually shall be updated annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Any other question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Any opposed. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| Item 8 J approved first reading of Knox County Board of Education policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| J 580 student suicide prevention as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| We have a motion by Miss Christy a second by Miss Owen discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Yes, for the same purpose of the last policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| I think again when we identify things in our policies that need to be named at each school we had need to have mechanism for accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| And so I would propose an amended amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| That states the director of school culture shall maintain a list of suicide prevention coordinators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| Including the name of each school and assigned coordinators throughout Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| This list shall be updated annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| And I propose that that's inserted in line 21 after suicide prevention coordinator is stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| So at the very end of that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| So it would just be on line 21 at the end of that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Can you read it one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| So let me do this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| The director of school culture shall maintain a list of suicide prevention coordinators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| Including the name of each school and assigned coordinator throughout Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| This list shall be updated annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Any question on that Miss Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| I think I have a question for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| If it says shall be updated annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| Would that keep us from updating the list more often than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| I mean it would not prevent sooner updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| But it would mandate at least that once per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Should we include at least or does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| I think you can go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| I mean if you're afraid that by just saying annually it will only be done once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| And you want to do it more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Then maybe add at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| I'm thinking that if the coordinator left Knox County schools in the middle of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| Then that might not get updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| And I'm fine with adding that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| My intent in saying updated annually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| We all know that there's turnover in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1365)|

| 0:31:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| So it's just to show appreciation to our employees for all of the hard work that they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| and to help as much as we could in terms of helping them not go backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| You know, we gave a raise a couple of years ago, but this would have been an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| obviously in their premium, which would make their earnings a little bit less for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| So just after a lot of conversation with Mr. McPherson and prayerful consideration on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1904)|
| 0:31:53| the best course to take, I thought I wanted to come back and just recommend to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| that we pay the full increase and absorb that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| You know, we're in the bottom 30%, I think, when it comes to benefits, 30% of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| in terms of our benefit contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| So this doesn't help us much, but it does help us by six tenths of a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| So it's going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| The average before this, if we do this, the average prior to this action would on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| 70.5% is what the board pays towards employee insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| This would actually raise it to 71.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| So six tenths of a point in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| And I think it's important to note, too, that the board, this gets lost in the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| a lot of times, but the board pays just out of the general purpose budget almost $35 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| towards employee, just medical insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| And if you look at federal programs and Title I, it's probably upwards of 36, between 36,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| $37 million that the board pays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| I think a lot of times that gets lost in the conversation, what the board does do toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| And just would appreciate you considering this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| And I think our employees would be very appreciative of the board picking up the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| That way they won't see an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Just a comment, and Superintendent Thomas, please correct me if I'm wrong, but the percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| that we pay is not just for the employee, but it's also potentially the spouse and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| children, too, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| We have several different plans, employee only, employee with children, maybe, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| an employee with a spouse, possibly, no children, two employees and spouse, which would include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| maybe a spouse not working, two employees where both parties work, both spouses work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| and then family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| So, yes, there's a percentage paid on all of those various plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| We've got the premier PPO, the standard, the limited, and the CDHP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| So, actually, four different plans, but about six versions within each one of those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| So, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| The reason I wanted to bring that out is I think it's really important to note that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| think that says something that Knox County Schools values our families of our educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| as well, that we're not just looking out for the employee themselves, but also the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| So, although, yes, we're potentially at 71.1%, I think it's great that we're looking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| for the entire unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Item 11E, approved restoration of five workdays for 255-day employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| We have a motion by Ms. Babb, a second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2081)|
| 0:34:49| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Mr. McMillan, you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| I won't be long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| I just want to make a comment and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| Superintendent, these raises on insurance and other things that we've moved, transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2103)|
| 0:35:13| of money, that won't have any, or this would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| I know this wouldn't have any impact on, I believe you mentioned, given the, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| didn't have money, given a one-time bonus, does that, it doesn't affect that or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| And thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Again, I meant to say that when I was talking about the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| We will still look at another couple of data points in terms of if we're able to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| a bonus to employees, certainly like to bring that back to the board for consideration as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| So neither one of these actions will impact that, but we do want to look at another data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| point or two before we come back and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I don't want to belabor the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| I think we probably will be okay from the latest figures of buying on a national basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2166)|
| 0:36:19| I think they had a report come out yesterday that showed something like what Ron talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| about last week with like a 130% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| I guess that will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| We'll hope it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| The only thing, and certainly I don't have a problem with the people having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2195)|
| 0:36:43| It's just a matter of when they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| And I personally would prefer us wait until spring, right before spring break or April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2206)|
| 0:36:59| 1st, but I realize that I'm only one of that opinion, so I'm sure it will pass and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2219)|
| 0:37:12| But I want to make sure that everybody understood that I did not have a problem with these employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| I have no idea what our ratings are for these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| I don't know how many people are watching it in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| And I know we had a meeting last week where some of this was addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| But for those who are watching, I think it would be great, Mr. McPherson, if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| just briefly tell us why we even have the ability to make some of these decisions right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| So we, and I'll try to be really brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| So when we drafted the budget this year, we did it from a very conservative basis based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| on everything that we were hearing from economists locally, at the state, nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| And as it turns out, consumer spending, though it was not quite at the level as the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2282)|
| 0:38:12| year and some of what I would call the COVID months, it was far, far better than what anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| had predicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| And when July rolls around for the current fiscal year we're in now, it's like just off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| the charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| It was so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| So it's kind of just blowing everybody away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| People are spending more than they've ever spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| It's significantly higher than it was in the previous year without COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| And so certainly we can't predict what the trend is going to be from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| But we weathered the storm quite well during the spring months when COVID first hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| And those were the months that people, I think, were most worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| So, so far, so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| We've been rolling right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| And so we felt pretty comfortable making these changes at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| And one of the things, too, I appreciate what Mr. McMillan is saying, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| You kind of want to wait and get some more information under your belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| But what we actually run into is, keep in mind, this is not a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| This is just simply restoring what was taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| If we wait too late, what happens is we go through the year and those days are already gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| So we're not giving folks additional money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| You know, we're just restoring those days that we're asking them to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| And so what happens is if we wait too late, then there's, you know, those days don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| there's a five extra days somewhere that they got to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| You know, so that's so that, you know, that was another consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Mr. McMillan, did you have a follow up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| Is July the latest figures that you've seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| State sales taxes run, they run about two months in arrears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| So, you know, obviously businesses file their sales tax returns to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| The state keeps 7% of the 9.25% and they remit the local portion back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| That's usually about a two-month turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| So we're always operating about two months, you know, behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| Well, these figures that I heard yesterday, I believe, or Monday, were on a national basis, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2410)|
| 0:40:19| and purchasing power, of course, you know, there's no way to know how that impacted us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| us being the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| But I was just saying, you know, kind of this sort of went along with what you were saying last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2429)|
| 0:40:40| that it surprised everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| I think those yesterday on national weights surprised everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| Yes, sir, I appreciate you saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| You know, one other thing, too, is not only have we exceeded the prior year amount in collections that, you know, non-COVID months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2449)|
| 0:41:01| we also budgeted, once again, very conservatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| So we budgeted an amount less in sales tax revenue than what we actually received this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| So we kind of got two factors working in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Number one, we're running far ahead of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| Not only are we running far ahead of budget, we're running far ahead of actuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| So it gave us an extra level of comfort there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| I'm thankful that we can do this now, and I would hope that we would be able to do something for the teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| and they certainly could use some encouragement right about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| And I know we say that we're thankful for them, and we are, but money talks, so that would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| So if there's no other discussion, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Mr. McMillan is opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| And Ms. Fab, we'll turn to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| Tanya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Again, I'm president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| You have really filled our hearts this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| There's three items on here of you passing them have showed your interest in how much you really care about Knox County educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2529)|
| 0:42:19| It doesn't matter if you are in supervision or if you are helping a student get off the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| but we're trying to make sure that we're doing the very best for our families here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| and doing the very best for our own personal families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| Just taking that little bit of the percentage of when we first heard of the increases back in February from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| that 7% of our insurance that we would have to come out of pocket in December was heartfelt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| But when you think about just last week that you came to us and said that we could take off that 7% and you would only have a 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2568)|
| 0:42:59| it still was gut-wrenching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| If you ever had an opportunity to sit in a classroom, which I know four of you have possibly actually taught in a classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2581)|
| 0:43:09| but I know the rest of you have actually volunteered in classrooms, but it is totally different from what you have done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2589)|
| 0:43:17| This year alone has become, as Ms. Cammie stated earlier, the teacher of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| It's a natural disaster for educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| We love our kids, but we cannot do our job with the undue stress of added expenses of our insurance and no raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2607)|
| 0:43:38| or working and not getting paid if you're an administrator for five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| These things that you just passed, I know there are tons of educators in Knox County that just cried today because you said thank you to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2624)|
| 0:44:01| It is rough, and we can't do it without your support in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| Is it all possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2649)|
| 0:44:22| I didn't ever think I would get this emotional because I too am not sitting in their seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| When you think about the kids that are coming in a classroom and it's changing every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| I asked a group of teachers today, when you think about your first year teaching, was it rough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2677)|
| 0:44:45| This year has become a first year teaching for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| When the superintendent was in the classroom back in the day, and we won't say how long, but we know that he thought this was the worst day ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2690)|
| 0:45:01| But he and I have continuous conversations that this is something that we would never wish on our worst enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2701)|
| 0:45:10| Again, we can't say thank you enough for taking that insurance of families that had to pay close to $125 more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2710)|
| 0:45:21| and they have family members that don't even have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| Or educators to this day that are in the hospital over COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| Again, we can't say thank you enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| Keeping this line of communication open for your educators is one of the best valuable things that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2737)|
| 0:45:46| And again, we can say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| And I know that your administration, the administrators of Knox County, will say thank you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Stacey Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2758)|
| 0:46:08| Is Stacey Beeler here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2768)|
| 0:46:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Angie Goethert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| And please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| Hi, my name is Angie Goethert, and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| Is that all you needed from me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| I am a daughter, a wife, and a mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| I've been a Knox County resident for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| It's a wonderful place to live and raise family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Since all this began in the spring, the city and the county have changed drastically, and that is disheartening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| As I begin this, I must let you know that I may get emotional, and I apologize if my emotions get the best of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| I do not deny there is a virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| There have been those that have gotten sick, and some have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| Protecting the elderly should be our top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| What I have seen is that this virus has many more unintended consequences that have nothing to do with being sick, hospitalized, or dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2827)|
| 0:47:16| First, I'll start with the high schoolers that our children share their lives with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| The stories they tell of being terrified that they'll go on red is heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| They constantly share that the teachers say when we go on red, not if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| Add to that the fear of being removed from the building due to the chance that they may have had contact with someone who tested positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| The students that are in that building are willing to do anything to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| The emotional trauma that our children are suffering from a virus that they may have already had or test positive for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| with a test that may show they had the virus months ago, and they are no longer infectious, is terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| I fear the mental health of these children will take years to get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| Unfortunately for some, as we know too well, will never recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| I need to talk about contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| How can it make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| If someone tests positive, which we don't know if they are infectious or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| causes a process of quarantining any close contact in the last 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| According to the CDC, a person who is positive, if infectious, could have shed the virus for many days before a positive test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2896)|
| 0:48:24| What about all those contacts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| The last 24 hours could have been past the time when the positive case was contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| Why not stay home if you're sick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Allow the healthy to remain in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Keep an eye on those people around that person, but sending them home is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| Again, the unintended consequences for the healthy are lost learning and falling further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| No one wants that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| The contact tracing must stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Online learning is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| If there is someone who has a true medical issue, I would hope we could figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| But allowing thousands of children to learn online is not serving them or the children in the building well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| Students receive text messages every day of how their online friends are finished or on vacation or out and about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| If they're afraid to be in the building, why are they out and about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| Also, if they're afraid to be in the building, why are they allowed to participate in extracurricular activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| These actions tell the students in the building every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| just wear your mask, stay away from your friends and accept that there is an entire group that does not have to do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| But they still get to do all the fun things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| The students in the building resent those that are online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| The unintended consequences is the loss of true empathy for those who may have real issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| when they are buried under those that say online is easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| The high schoolers also shared they're constantly told to pull their mask up and stay apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| Many times they are strongly spoken to about their mask when they're eating or drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| How can they be expected to wear a mask while doing these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| Also, they've witnessed teachers outside talking on their phones, crying and hearing them say they can't do it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| The fear is rampant and we cannot continue to scare our children and our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| The unintended consequences of changing people to live in fear is beyond costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| One of my friends who teaches in Knox County called me in tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| I did my best to calm her down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Once she could speak, she told me that I was really the only one she could talk to other than her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| She fears if she speaks to other teachers or administrators at her school, she could lose her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| What she said next was heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| One of the little girls in her class started to cry and become inconsolable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| She finally sat on the floor holding her in her lap, trying to get her to calm down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| When the little girl finally spoke, she said, I can't see anybody's faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| And I'm scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| At that point, she took down her mask and smiled at her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| And then she asked the other students to take their masks down too so that the little girl could see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| The other kids smiled at her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| She was able to get everyone settled and back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| What are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| This little girl is scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Again, unintended consequences for this little girl may not be known for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| What we're asking of our children while at school is crushing many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| We are instilling a complete sense of fear by our words and our actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| This is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| We are smart people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| We can look around at other places all over the country that are doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| Many of them do not do extreme and harmful contact tracing or mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| If someone wants to wear a mask, they should be able to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| But I think it should always be a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| As for contact tracing, the goal is for them to be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| Removing children who may have been exposed does not accomplish that goal or intended consequences or a failure to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| Thank you for coming to speak for us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| Can I please read the last paragraph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| I have to get this out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| Okay, but if it's brief, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| I am not a medical professional, but since this started, my children have had many questions that I've found myself researching to find answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| I've read from those that spread fear and those that truly want to find answers and are considering the total health of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| The mental health part of all this is being swept away for a virus that, according to science, there's a close to 100% chance of children and adults under 65 recovering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3126)|
| 0:52:15| Our fear, our biggest mistake, was closing schools in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| Our children are waiting for us to be the adult in the room and do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| I grew up as parents from the Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| My mom and dad always said, when we know better, we do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| It's been months, and we know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| We owe it to our children to do better and protect them from the unintended consequences that are happening right before our eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| It's time to take a stand and do better for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Amber Burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3164)|
| 0:52:54| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Amber Burns, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| I'm going to be honest, that's going to be a little bit hard to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| So, I am also a parent of a Knox County kiddo, and I'm also a medical health care provider here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3181)|
| 0:53:09| So, I have a bit of an organization here on my notes, but just to be honest, so I'm in a place every day where people open up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3189)|
| 0:53:19| My patients, I don't deal directly with COVID patients, but I have patients that come in from all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| I see teachers, administrators, bus drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| I see all kinds of people, and because of my job, they talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| There's also a large group of parents, over 400 of us, that have started sharing our stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| And I just want to be honest and say, just like Angie just mentioned, there's some heartbreaking stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| I would like to say, we appreciate our teachers very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| I grew up, both my parents were teachers and administrators in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| I actually taught for four years before I went to school to be a medical professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| I respect teachers. You guys do an awesome job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| I love the teachers my daughter has always had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| There is no, in my opinion, no more important job than teaching and educating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| I was kind of doing a bit of research going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| You know, this used to be a luxury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Education used to be a luxury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Now it's something we have to have for our kids long-term to be able to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| You know, change their economic status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| It is a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| My opinion, it is as important as health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| It is as important as going to the grocery store and getting groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| I fear the long-term ramifications of changing drastically to our education system is going to be really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| Now, I think virtual option is valid for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| There are some people that are affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Most of those people are older adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| I worked with an inpatient doctor recently who works at Fort Sanders in the COVID floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| And I asked him what his opinion was with kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| He said, Amber, it's not the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| It's not the parents that we need to be worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| It is those grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| It is other family members with comorbid conditions that we need to be more worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| School is not a harmful place for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| I would ask that as we move forward, I know you guys speak with the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| we have to learn that data is always continuing to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| School has been open now long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| There is new research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| The people who have made policies came from a place of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| This is a very fearful time for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| But we have more research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| We have more good information now that we can start looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| Now, we're talking about kids specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| They now know that the mortality rate in kids is no higher than the seasonal flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| In kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| We're not talking about older adults, people who have comorbid conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| This is no worse than the flu in kids, in the population that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| The mortality rate is very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Debra is going to talk in a minute and give you more numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| But there has been no deaths in Knox County from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| There have been other very serious things that have happened because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| That may lead to depression, suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| We all know somebody who's been affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| That can be more harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Do I think that there needs to be things done in school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| I'm in the unpopular side that I say I don't have a problem wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| I sent my daughter to Knox County because I thought if she was wearing a mask, at least she could stay in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| I talked to somebody yesterday who does contact tracing and works with the Board of Health in another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| And I asked her specifically, if both people are wearing masks, what is the chance of exposure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| Her answer, very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Ask anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| It's very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| In health care, if both of us are wearing masks, even if that person tests positive later, they go, your chance was very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| You just monitor your symptoms, take your temperature, go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| So what I would say is, you know, when the question comes up, why is Knox County remaining very low in COVID transmission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| It's because we're doing what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| It's not because we're sending all these kids home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| We don't need to do that because their chance is very low, they're wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| The only other thing I kind of wanted to get to, I know the chances of all this changing are actually very slim, but I would ask that we look at new data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| It's helping our parents when we know that we're getting towards a school closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| I would ask for more transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Let us have numbers, more specifically, it can even be percentages for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| I know there's cases in my daughter's school, I have no idea how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Do I need to prepare now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Do I have time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Are we doing okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Be nice to know that, because I've exchanged emails with a few of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| There is no health care, child care options right now available to parents last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| Safety is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| These kids are staying home alone, illegally, because parents have to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| Child care options that are available, like Boys and Girls Club, we're talking about 30 to 60 kids in a group together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| More dangerous outside of school than if they were in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| Smaller group of kids wearing masks, safety precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Deborah Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3483)|
| 0:58:16| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Deborah Howard, Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Superintendent, Madam Chair, board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| I want to read you a quick declaration signed by several doctors that you can find online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| So this is the Great Barrington Declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| Okay, some of this talks about a lockdown, but just ignore that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists, we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies and recommend an approach we call focused protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3521)|
| 0:58:55| Coming from both the left and the right and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| The results, to name a few, include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings, and deteriorating mental health, leading to greater excess mortality in the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3546)|
| 0:59:20| With the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden, keeping students out of school is a grave injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| And I would just say that's the portion that deals with the whole isolation, which I refuse to call it quarantining because that's what you do when you're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3567)|
| 0:59:36| This is isolation that we're doing to our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3579)|
| 0:59:46| Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than 1,000-fold higher in the old and infirm than in the young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all, including the vulnerable, falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity, the point at which the rate of new infection is stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| And that can be assisted by, but not dependent upon, a vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3620)|
| 1:00:29| to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| We call this focus protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| Simple hygiene measures, such as handwashing and staying home when sick, should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| Young, low-risk adults should work normally rather than from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Restaurants and other businesses should open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| Arts, music, sports, and other cultural activities should resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3663)|
| 1:01:12| Dr. Martin Kulldorff from Harvard, Dr. Sunita Gupta from Oxford University, and Dr. J. Bhattacharya from Stanford University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3672)|
| 1:01:22| The Great Barrington Declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| So you can find that online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| I just want to end with a few numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| When I spoke to you all in September, one month ago, we had 791 cases in the age group of 0 to 17, with 9 hospitalized and 0 deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3689)|
| 1:01:39| Today, there's 1,137 cases that we've had, 10 hospitalizations and 0 deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3699)|
| 1:01:48| Nationwide, in that group, 95 deaths in that age range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| I don't like any death of anybody, especially children, but that's extremely low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| In the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 to 2010, there were 358 deaths in that age range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| We didn't wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| We didn't send kids home because they were near somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| Average flu-related deaths range from 2004 to 2019 is between 37 and 187, just on a regular flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3729)|
| 1:02:20| Today, this is the part that I want to specifically talk to, is that the kids aren't getting the teachers sick, and they're really not getting each other sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3740)|
| 1:02:30| They're probably getting it somewhere else, because if you look, before school was even in session, per the Knox County COVID tracker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201007?start=3750)|
