| 2:04:08| I appreciate the conversation with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| Earlier, we were talking about the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| and the sector plan amendment for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| near the old Johnson Bible College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| We're looking at, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| you really need to pay attention to what the sector plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| because that is the guide for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| And the sector plan for this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| has been medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| since the Northwest County sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| was last adopted and amended in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| Medium-density residential allows densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| up to between six and 24 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| The property that we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| the density we're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| is less than that at five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| Based upon the density calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| that would be approximately 57 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| We don't know if that's what's actually going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| onto this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| The fact is, until we have the zoning in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| there's not going to be any investment in the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| that's going to have to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| before this can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| Knox County has a very robust stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| ordinance in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| and we would have to comply with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| And we'd have to work with Knox County engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| to make sure that we're not causing additional runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| that would impact the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| that's already happening in the flood zone for Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| Beaver Creek's the largest watershed in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| And we're aware there are problems there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| and we're aware that we're going to have to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| and engineer around that, which we are committed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| This is the rezoning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| Before we can break ground and develop anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| we have to go through a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| to the concept plan that will be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| We'd have to meet all the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| of the stormwater ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| and work with county engineering on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| So if that's done properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| which there's no reason to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| that it won't be done properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| we won't be causing any additional problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| with the flooding out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| In fact, we may improve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| by being able to address some of the existing stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| that's occurring on the property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| As staff has pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| this is a planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| It's intended to provide imaginative solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| to environmental design problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| That's why we've asked for this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| It's consistent with the zoning that is across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| to the north and the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| So it fits in with what is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7606)|
| 2:06:51| This property, even though it has a West Emory address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| it is really at the New Carnes Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| The New Carnes Valley Drive actually merges into West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| And we have 26 feet of pavement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| We have a three-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| We have-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| It's actually a two-lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| with a small turn onto West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| when you stay on West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| Ms. Maples, please don't interrupt Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| while he's speaking, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| Go ahead, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| And yes, it does merge down to a two-way street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| as it goes further east onto West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| But approaching this from Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| then you're looking at a pretty robust road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| before you get to where it actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| becomes the West Emory Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| So the Marshall family has owned this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| since 1951.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| The areas out there have grown up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| and they would like to be able to maximize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| on their investment in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| and sell it to a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| that can help it reach its potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| This is one of the fastest growing areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| There is a definite need for housing in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| and it's consistent with our sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| And when we're making land use decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| we have to make it with consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| to the standards that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| And we can meet all those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| So we would ask that the commission respectfully approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| follow staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| and improve the rezoning to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| And I'm available if there's any specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| Ms. Griffith, you've got just a few seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| Would you like to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7727)|
| 2:08:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| Brenda Griffith, 8328 Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| Our property is directly across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7736)|
| 2:09:01| from the proposed site you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| Two weeks ago or three weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| you probably would have had to build houseboats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| You all have no idea what goes on out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| And if this high density housing is appropriately zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| then we are in the wrong county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| There is no way that that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| can possibly accommodate that many houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| And you need to get out here and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7773)|
| 2:09:39| and put this study on review and not do any voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| pass on this, table it until some more studies have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| Thank you, Ms. Griffith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| The time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| Commissioners, I noticed that Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| your hand is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| Yes, I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| The first one is, this is directed to Ms. Maples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7802)|
| 2:10:08| and Ms. Sokomsky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Drove out to the area, I was on the Emory Valley area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7813)|
| 2:10:18| where the signs were posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| And are any of your pictures, I'm trying to orient myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| are any of those pictures that you shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| or that Ms. Maples shared from that spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| looking into the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Some of the pictures I shared were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| because we are directly across the street on West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| We're at 8517, and I was just marveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| at how it looks like a lake over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| because we just moved here a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| and I had never seen flooding like I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| But they are of that direct area where the sign is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| A text joking we could have kayaked off of her deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| Thank you for helping me get my orientation for the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7863)|
| 2:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| The second question that I had is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| this is procedural for the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| that have been at this longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| If the vote today approves a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| so that a development can happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7881)|
| 2:11:25| yet then the study takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| any additional flooding studies that are required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| and it limits the property, the buildable property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| beyond the, I think the engineer said 8.75 acres right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| beyond that, and the developer determines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7901)|
| 2:11:46| well, this isn't going to be a profitable endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| What happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| Is it just a kind of peculiar property parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| that's rezoned a certain way but not usable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| or how does that play out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| I'll answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| The rezoning, if approved, would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| And if this developer decides not to exercise an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| or proceed with the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| they could sell it to another developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| who may have a different template for the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| or the developer may, this developer may change the template.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| The PR allows for a range of housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7942)|
| 2:12:27| and allows a variety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7947)|
| 2:12:30| establishes no minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| in anticipation of dealing with situations such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| where the amount of developable land is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| And again, the planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| provides for a great deal of flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7963)|
| 2:12:46| in the design of the development for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| But the zoning would remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| and any development plan would be subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| to any restrictions on developable land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| as a result of any updated flood study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| Commissioner Uden, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| Yeah, I think the applicant's representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| kind of captured some of my thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| that I was going to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| which kind of speaks to Commissioner Adams' questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| You know, until we have a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| that's submitted with some engineering drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| showing if they're going to try to fill the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| showing what kind of mitigation they're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| on the drainage and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| you know, we really don't know completely what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| And, you know, they could try to put condos in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| and shove them all against the road or townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| They could put small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| They could do a thousand square feet of landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| to try to use that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| It's tough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| I don't think staff gets it right all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| We all have differences of opinion sometimes on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| I think that at this point, until we see a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8046)|
| 2:14:12| I think we ought to be able to give the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| because of the staff recommendation of the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| the opportunity to at least submit a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| to see what the engineers are coming up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| And I did used to live out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| It's been quite a while, but I'm familiar with the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| and I do know it floods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| and I've got a cousin that lives out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| And I used to work at Weigel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| and drive out there on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| It is serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| I've gotten calls from plenty of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| commissioners, county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| I'm in this business and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| Commissioner Graf has said a thousand times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8090)|
| 2:14:53| in these meetings that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| we're approving this zoning at one to five for the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| This is, you know, this is not a guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| that you get up to five for the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| It gives the applicant the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| to go through the engineering process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| and the planning process to see if five is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| And I would hope that the applicant will be very diligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| in this period of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| and get their engineers to take time as they do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| You know, nobody wants to make a huge mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| I know the county is gonna look at this very, very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| And, you know, so I would be with staff on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| just to give them the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| And I would make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| to approve the plan residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8143)|
| 2:15:48| Oh, did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8150)|
| 2:15:51| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| Commissioner Hill seconds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8154)|
| 2:15:54| Miss Eason, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| Yeah, I think I'm really concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| about the flooding in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| I have seen the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| and I'm familiar with what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| on portions of Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| I also am always concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| that the county allows a portion of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| of the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| of the FEMA 100-year floodplain to be filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| But like Commissioner Uten says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| until this actually comes back to us on a use on a review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| I don't know if developers intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| to be involved in that floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| So I think that part of my decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| I need to wait until I actually see what's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| I just wanted to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| that I am also concerned about the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| the increased flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| the increased development that we're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| and the increase in heavy rainfalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| that we're having also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| So I think those are things to look closely at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| when the plan comes back to us as a use on a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| Thank you, Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| Yes, this is a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| where planned residential is entirely warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| because of the environmental constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| My concern is whether there's a height limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| in planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| My fear is that they'll stack a lot of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| on the high ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| and it will not be very compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| with the existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8239)|
| 2:17:23| Even the PRs across the street seem to be a lower height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8243)|
| 2:17:28| Is there a height limit in PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| This is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| The height limitation houses and duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8254)|
| 2:17:40| shall not exceed three stories in the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| And then the height of all others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| shall be determined by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| So that can happen at the time of use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| When we get to use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| I'm a new commissioner too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| And how do we have much flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| in guiding the design once it's submitted to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| Very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| Commissioner Nadette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| Yes, my question is for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| At what point in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| or what threshold for this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| would a traffic study be warranted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| And is West Emory Road a state-owned road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| or a county-owned road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| I know that traffic in that area is awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| And so I'm not sure of the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| this property would have on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| This is Liz Albertson again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| I will speak as much to this as I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| and then defer to other staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| that might be a little more experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| in traffic and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| However, if their proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| if the AASHTO standard based on land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| and type of land use and number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| if that generates a possible average daily traffic count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8342)|
| 2:19:09| of at least 750 trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| then they would be required to do a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8354)|
| 2:19:21| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| And then in reference to West Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| I believe at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| it's controlled by TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8366)|
| 2:19:33| No, it's actually controlled by a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8373)|
| 2:19:37| Corn Valley Drive is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| TDOT controls West Emory up into where it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| into the junction here with Beaver Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| and then it travels south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8387)|
| 2:19:51| So this is a county property, county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| OK, so there might be more opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| for changes to be made to the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| faster than TDOT potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8405)|

| 2:22:32| as recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8552)|

| 2:23:09| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| I was at a meeting that Mr. Harbin was at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| along with County Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| and Engineering Public Works staff and planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| So good to see how this was being worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| One thing that was brought up at agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| so I'm just responding to a couple of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8609)|
| 2:23:30| from the agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| One thing that was brought in was the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| of when the sidewalks are put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| I think Mr. Harbin had stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| the developers often wait to put sidewalks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| until after they've completed all the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| and the driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8626)|
| 2:23:46| That way the construction crews do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| they don't put sidewalks in that have the construction crews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| damage the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| But then that creates kind of the issue of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| well, then you've got to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| and cut the driveways potentially for the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| And if you have residents that have already moved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| you get residents who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| well, I actually like the folks in my driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| I wasn't expecting the sidewalk to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| So that's actually, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| a good discussion item for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| I think it was brought in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| when do you bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| which should sidewalks be put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| and the expectations that the homeowners have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| There's also some question I encourage you to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| Mr. Elliott about the routing of the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8669)|
| 2:24:33| They did at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| a lot of work looking at bringing a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| down Coteny Road and then back over to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| And we're looking at really narrow lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| ditches and the expense to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| of actually trying to extend that sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| down the Coteny Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| and then turning at Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| So that was a fact that I didn't hear the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| I thought you all should know as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| Mr. Harvard, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| David Harvard for 334 Paper Mill Drive here in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| on behalf of our client Smith Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| As Mr. Murphy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| we did have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| I did have a meeting with Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| officials from the school department were there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| as well as in-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| And during that meeting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| after discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| Knox County pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| that the sidewalk all the way down Coteny Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| in front of the school is more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8734)|
| 2:25:37| And after discussion with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8737)|
| 2:25:44| they determined that a rear entry for the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| would work better for the safety standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| for the people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| So we've agreed to build the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| down the frontage of Coteny Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| in front of our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| and it'll turn on the south there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| and go into the back of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| Connect our neighborhood as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| to those sidewalks right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| And our developer will be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| to offer all those sidewalks in Laiu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| building sidewalks within the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8770)|
| 2:26:14| So Mr. Daley has been instrumental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| in working with the homeowners out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| the South North Homeowner Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| He said he had over 30 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8782)|
| 2:26:23| that reviewed the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| and they were in agreement with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| And so we would urge per staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| that this approval or this request be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8793)|
| 2:26:33| TODD BANDUCCI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| Thank you, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| I'll go to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| Mr. Roth, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| TODD ROTH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| Thanks, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| I just want to actually say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| that I may have to click off here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| in about five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| I just wanted to say it publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| that I've got a funeral to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| So I'm not being rude if I abruptly leave the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| CHAIRMAN HOVLAND.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| Mr. Smith, Scott Smith, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| SCOTT SMITH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| OK, just a couple of clarifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| I want to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| On the original concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| sidewalks were required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| And it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| they were required internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| but I'm not sure were they required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| down Coatney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| And the problem I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| with the previous approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| was there was no way to get to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| And is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| Somebody tell me if I'm understanding correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| MIKE REYNOLDS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| Yes, Commissioner Smith, this is Mike Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| Sidewalks on Coatney Road were required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| just along their frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| as well as the internal sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| And then there was a condition of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| I guess, talking to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| about making a connection to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| but it wasn't necessarily an absolute requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8879)|
| 2:28:03| So I think there was some hesitancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| of whether or not the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| would actually want that connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| But we know now that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| would accept that connection with today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| So that's how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| CHAIRMAN HOVLAND.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| OK, and what I'm trying to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| is the difference in what was approved technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| and what they want now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| And as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8904)|
| 2:28:25| if he complied with the original requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| he would build sidewalks down Coatney Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| and in the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| but he would not make any connection to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| It would not go past his property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| And what I understand kind of the tradeoff is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| that the county may feel like is worthwhile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| is that now they have found a way to connect in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| to turn the corner and connect in to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| And that is what's better about this compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| And I'm just, is that, am I understanding that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| COMMISSIONER PATTERSON.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| I think that's one way to look at it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| CHAIRMAN HOVLAND.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8941)|
| 2:29:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8942)|
| 2:29:03| COMMISSIONER PATTERSON.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8943)|
| 2:29:03| Yeah, or it wasn't an absolute requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| to connect to the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| CHAIRMAN HOVLAND.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| CHAIRMAN POWELL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| Commissioner Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8950)|
| 2:29:11| COMMISSIONER CORBELIC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| Yes, I'm trying to figure this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| as well as Commissioner Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| So I have a number of questions for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| One is, it's my understanding, and I might be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8963)|
| 2:29:28| that when you submit your original plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8968)|
| 2:29:33| that you submit engineered drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| of your right-of-way improvements, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| would be the road, the gutter, the curb, and the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| And that would include the driveway locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| Is that correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8985)|
| 2:29:46| COMMISSIONER SCOTT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| Well, it doesn't include the driveway locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| It would show the road sidewalks location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| just by doing the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| Yes, ma'am, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8997)|
| 2:29:58| COMMISSIONER PATTERSON.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9000)|
| 2:30:00| So for the areas, which I'm assuming what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| is the phase one of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| you have already engineered the sidewalk along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9008)|
| 2:30:13| whoops, what happened to my picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| Cherokee Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| Can we go back to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9019)|
| 2:30:20| Yeah, that's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9020)|
| 2:30:21| But, and the road on the top, it doesn't have road names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9021)|
| 2:30:27| But the loop, you've already engineered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9027)|
| 2:30:30| and you're installing the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| for the first phase of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| And based on the engineered drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| for the curb, gutter, sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| and relationship to the driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| And the reason I'm pointing this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| is because I think we have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| conflicting philosophies happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| One is the concern for the complete streets theme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9055)|
| 2:30:59| which is where you have pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| as important as automobiles on the public right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| which would mean sidewalks as well as cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| On the other, we have this concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| a very legitimate concern about providing safe access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| from Coach Drive to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| And what I'm wondering is if we could look at a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9083)|
| 2:31:28| of satisfying both of those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| by providing sidewalks in the phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| particularly the entrance way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| where all of the traffic converges to reach coats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| And then for both sidewalks and phase two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| which is primarily dead-end streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| and proceed with installing the sidewalk around the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| And that sidewalk should also be meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| the arborist design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| so that the tree is maintained in a healthy condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9121)|
| 2:32:06| Because roots are primarily surface roots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| for these large trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| So I toss this out for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| Can we look at a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| where the applicant can proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9137)|
| 2:32:18| with his engineered drawings for phase one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9138)|
| 2:32:21| regarding installation of the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| forego installation of sidewalks for phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| and proceed to install the connection to the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9149)|
| 2:32:39| Ms. Korbelik, are you asking staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| or are you asking the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| Oh, I'd like to start with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| Mr. Harmon, would you like to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| to the commissioner's comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| Mrs. Korbelik, could you restate your question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| It's fairly long and I forgot most in that state question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| Sure. Would you be comfortable as the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9182)|
| 2:33:06| and the applicant's representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| to install the sidewalks in phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| forego sidewalk installation in phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| and install the connection to this elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| Would that be a compromise you'd be willing to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9199)|
| 2:33:25| Well, right now I do not have my client here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| I've been instructed by him the compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9207)|
| 2:33:30| that we worked out once again with the county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9210)|
| 2:33:34| with the South Doyle Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9214)|
| 2:33:39| and by the current owners that are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| that seem to be complicit with this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| This is what that we have all agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| is how they want to proceed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| So, you know, anything additional to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| I would have to defer to my client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| who is not online today on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| And then once again, pull in our county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| and the South Doyle Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| once again to explore other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9245)|
| 2:34:08| But I cannot make that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| I cannot agree to that without my client's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9252)|
| 2:34:16| And would your client be willing to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| with the sidewalk installation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| meet arborist standards to protect the health of the tree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| Absolutely. We'll stay outside the grid line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| There's plenty of room on that lot right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| that will be part of that design plan there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| to protect that tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9281)|
| 2:34:46| I have one, two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| The first one is about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9289)|
| 2:34:54| I guess the South Doyle Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| and the agreement that reached this compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| I want to say it sounds like they've come to a healthy point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9300)|
| 2:35:05| in being able to get safe passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9305)|
| 2:35:08| along a sidewalk to the school, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| My question is about the people who own the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9312)|
| 2:35:17| in this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| and the question we discussed as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| Do those individuals know that if they were sold a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| a sidewalk wouldn't be happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9328)|
| 2:35:33| Mr. Harbin, can you respond to Commissioner Adams' question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9333)|
| 2:35:40| Personally, I've not talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| My client says that he's talked to him and they're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9341)|
| 2:35:45| And I'll go ahead and point out too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| that this is a participation support here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9346)|
| 2:35:49| You just can't be silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| The property has been posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| The postcards have gone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9355)|
| 2:35:58| Notifying that this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| And so they've been notified or should be notified right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9361)|
| 2:36:06| that this is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| And also, they have the ability to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9370)|
| 2:36:14| in the South Doyle Homeowners Association too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| So my client has assured me that they are aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| and that they're comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9381)|
| 2:36:25| I don't have firsthand knowledge of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9385)|
| 2:36:26| but I do know they have firsthand knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| that at least the postcards and the property has been posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9389)|
| 2:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9395)|
| 2:36:36| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| And like some other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| I spoke with Commissioner Daley as well as Jim Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9402)|
| 2:36:45| and the compromise that was worked out came about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| because what will happen is Knox County School Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9408)|
| 2:36:52| is going to be building a pedestrian bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| to connect the young campus with the main campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| And that's where this connection point comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9418)|
| 2:36:59| to tie in with all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| So with that, I would move adoption of this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9427)|
| 2:37:11| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| I had a question about how many of the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9433)|
| 2:37:16| in this particular development have actually been sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| How many homeowners exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| in this particular development right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| Mr. Harbin, can you answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9445)|
| 2:37:28| I'm not sure of the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| I think around a dozen or so right now at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| He's in the process of building quite a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| and it's a very popular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| So that could be a few more than that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9457)|
| 2:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| We have a motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| seconded by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| to approve the applicant's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| to remove the sidewalk condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| Condition number three of the concept plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| of January 12, 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| and replace it with the following condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| as recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| Mr. Wise, would you call the roll please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9486)|

| 2:38:23| Mr. Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9504)|
| 2:38:25| Mr. Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9505)|

| 2:39:29| I'm back on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9569)|
| 2:39:30| Mr. Graff, your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9570)|
| 2:39:36| Before I say anything or my vote, are we setting a precedent here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9576)|
| 2:39:43| of coming back and redoing things because of changing policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9583)|
| 2:39:57| I think that's what initiated this was Knox County Commission changed their policy on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9597)|
| 2:40:06| a financial responsibility in the school zone that it wasn't automatically required like it had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9606)|
| 2:40:16| been. And are we saying, well, okay, now other applicants that were required to have sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9616)|
| 2:40:29| do they have the right to come in and be reconsidered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9629)|
| 2:40:35| Director Green, would you like to comment with Commissioner Graff's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9635)|
| 2:40:48| Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| Maybe he's already retired. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| Commissioner Graff, I don't think we've set a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| You know, we, as mentioned, you know, there was ample opportunity for the public participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9659)|
| 2:41:06| and comments and apparently the residents are accepting of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9666)|
| 2:41:17| That's my understanding also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9680)|
| 2:41:22| Mr. Graff, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9682)|
| 2:41:25| Okay, then I'll vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9685)|
| 2:41:29| This is 13-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9689)|

| 2:42:04| Approximate acreage is 23.17. Zoning is agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| Existing land use is agriculture. Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9729)|
| 2:42:15| Number of lots, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9735)|

| 2:42:29| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| All right, Mr. Graham, would you like to go first? Would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| I'd like for the opposition to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| Mr. Murphy, you've got five minutes. Please state your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9758)|
| 2:42:44| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| Thank you, Chairman Phillips. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9766)|
| 2:42:51| I'm speaking on as the chair of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| This property, I sent you a letter which I would ask you to pull up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9775)|
| 2:43:00| I also ask you to pull up the Northeast County Sector Plan and turn to page 35 in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9780)|
| 2:43:05| Those are two materials that I wish to present on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9785)|
| 2:43:09| First, this particular parcel, this currently has a lot of agricultural use right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9789)|
| 2:43:16| primarily for hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9796)|
| 2:43:17| But there's a very important drawing or a figure that I put in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| That's a farmland soils map from KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| And I wanted to point out to you that this piece of property has a large amount of locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9806)|
| 2:43:32| important soil as well as some prime soil that marked some of the areas we're draining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9812)|
| 2:43:38| The proposal is to divide this property up into several large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| And I think this is really an example of what excessive extraordinary sprawl looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9824)|
| 2:43:52| It's a really poor use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9832)|
| 2:43:57| It's extremely low density, one house every three, four or five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| And I think this is exactly what our planning structure and framework tries to guide away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9842)|
| 2:44:12| This is an area that it's in the Northeast County Sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9852)|
| 2:44:16| On page 35, we discuss what's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9856)|
| 2:44:20| And I want to quote from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| Residents voice concerned at public meetings regarding current agricultural zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| how the permanency of one billion unit per acre works against sustaining and protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| these rural landscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| And the residents say that they really, many residents choose to live in this area because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9873)|
| 2:44:41| of the rural character that long-term planning is necessary to balance future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| with qualities inherited in Northeast County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9885)|
| 2:44:49| I really urge you, instead of considering this plan, to consider ways to go about an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9889)|
| 2:44:55| alternate approach here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| Page 35 of the sector plan calls out small lot and cluster rural residential zone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9897)|
| 2:45:05| allow you to preserve some assets like hillsides and farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| We don't have that zoning, but under planned residential, you could actually have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9909)|
| 2:45:14| rezoned planned residential and put in a plan that is actually a conservation subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| That would allow you to develop, put some home sites on it, yet preserve the remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9919)|
| 2:45:24| land for agricultural use, preserve some of that locally important and prime soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9924)|
| 2:45:30| So, I think that, you know, this is really, this is an example where a proposal in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9930)|
| 2:45:36| of you for, you know, very large lot subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9936)|
| 2:45:41| But we have a sector plan, you know, not only this, but the East County community plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9941)|
| 2:45:48| the East County sector plan, South County sector plan, all talk about trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| conservation subdivisions and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| This is a piece of, this is a parcel that is, would be a great idea to actually, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9955)|
| 2:46:01| know, use that as an implementation tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| And I urge you to reject this concept plan instead to encourage, you know, encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| the applicant to work on a conservation subdivision plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| Murphy, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9974)|
| 2:46:15| I'm not saying I disagree with your comments, but, you know, we cannot be arbitrary in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9975)|
| 2:46:21| our decisions on this unless the PR or the zoning allows it accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9981)|
| 2:46:28| As long as the tracks or zoning regulations, we're kind of obliged to follow through with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9988)|
| 2:46:34| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| Mr. Graham, could you give me your name and your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| Hey, it's Mark Graham, 1410 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| Mr. Murphy, I appreciate your comments and Chairman, I appreciate your comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| As, just as a note, Mr. Murphy, the previous owner had a very, very, very high density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10008)|
| 2:46:56| concept for this plan, including the bridge across Cross Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| He sold the property to my client and he wasn't that ambitious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10020)|
| 2:47:09| He wanted a lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| I understand what you're saying as well, that we could cluster that low density, even with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| We wanted to cluster those homes together and preserve the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10037)|
| 2:47:24| What motivated the subdivision at all were evidently a few, a couple maybe of folks were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10044)|
| 2:47:31| looking for a place to board horses and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10051)|
| 2:47:35| So we'll probably see those lots six and seven will probably be residential and the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10055)|
| 2:47:44| is just up in the air right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| They may or may not develop into homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| That's, that's all I have, unless you've got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10071)|
| 2:47:56| Thank you, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| Turn over to Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| Ms. Korbelik, I see your hand is raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| I took the opportunity to pull up a study from UTK, the Extension Institute of Agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10087)|
| 2:48:17| and they've identified for this area in 2015 that the, or rather for Knox County, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10097)|
| 2:48:25| contribution of agriculture back in 2015, the agricultural output by itself economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10105)|
| 2:48:34| benefited Knox County by $1.9 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| And with the multiplier effect, it's $3 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10117)|
| 2:48:41| Likewise, with jobs for Knox County in 2015, agriculture provided 4,940 workers and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10121)|
| 2:48:51| the multiplier effect, almost 13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| And so what I asked the applicant is, is there any way that you can proceed with developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10135)|
| 2:49:02| the property but provide some kind of conservation easement so that this finite amount of prime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10142)|
| 2:49:10| agriculture and suitable agriculture can be saved for the economic good of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10150)|
| 2:49:20| I could, I could pass that on to my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| He's currently, if you've, if you've been out there recently and noticed, he currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10162)|
| 2:49:26| has that, that part, that hole in hay and he gets three cuttings a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10166)|
| 2:49:32| So he's, he's aware of the economical benefits of the agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10172)|
| 2:49:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10177)|
| 2:49:40| Commissioner Easton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| I appreciate the comments that Mr. Murphy made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| And I think, I think it is really important for us to be looking for those areas where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| we have prime soils, prime farms, and I realize that from Commissioner Phillips that we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10188)|
| 2:49:55| don't have too much, too many options in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| So I just, I think I would follow up and say that I do encourage the, the developer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10199)|
| 2:50:05| try and disturb as little of the soil as property as possible in the process of doing the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10205)|
| 2:50:11| and try to encourage, try to either put a conservation easement on some of it or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10211)|
| 2:50:16| encourage the future residents, you know, to disturb as little and plant native or leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10216)|
| 2:50:21| it as hay or even plant native grasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10223)|
| 2:50:24| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10224)|
| 2:50:25| Thank you, Commissioner Easton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| I wanted to also thank Mr. Murphy for his comments and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| I think that those were very helpful and also to highlight specific areas in the plans where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| this makes, where there are reasons for concern and reasons to consider something differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10241)|
| 2:50:48| My question is about the conservation subdivision concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10248)|
| 2:50:55| And is that something that the staff would have pulled out in their assessment or, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10255)|
| 2:51:03| trying to be sensitive to Commissioner Phillips' comment about not being arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10263)|
| 2:51:11| Is that a responsibility or a possibility that the staff didn't consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10271)|
| 2:51:16| The planned residential zoning allows for, again, flexibility in the design of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10276)|
| 2:51:23| So, that could have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| We've done some initial research into conservation subdivisions and trying to identify incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10285)|
| 2:51:33| for a conservation subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10293)|
| 2:51:34| And it's tough to identify incentives for a conservation subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10294)|
| 2:51:39| Typical one is additional density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| But we often provide the applicants in their zoning requests with the density they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10301)|
| 2:51:48| for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| So, there are a few incentives available that we've been able to identify to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10309)|
| 2:51:56| conservation subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| We'll keep working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| But again, under the planned residential zoning, the applicant has the flexibility to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| conservation subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10324)|
| 2:52:06| Thank you, Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10328)|
| 2:52:09| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion that we approve the concept plan subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10329)|
| 2:52:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10336)|
| 2:52:18| We have a motion to approve the concept plan subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10338)|
| 2:52:24| Motion by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| Commissioner Korbelik, I see your hand is still up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10348)|
| 2:52:38| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10358)|
| 2:52:39| I just wanted to respond that one inherent benefit in conservation subdivisions is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10359)|
| 2:52:51| it reduces the amount of infrastructure because the properties, the developed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10371)|
| 2:52:57| generally located in a cluster and that homes receive a 15% increase in appraisal when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10377)|
| 2:53:06| are next to an open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| So, there are some inherent benefits with conservation subdivisions, although incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10388)|
| 2:53:13| are extra helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10393)|
| 2:53:15| I just wanted to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10395)|
| 2:53:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10397)|

| 2:55:48| Mr. Fulgham, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| Would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| Let's let the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| Mr. Murphy, your name and your address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10556)|
| 2:56:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10560)|
| 2:56:01| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918, speaking as chair of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10561)|
| 2:56:08| Not exactly opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| I did send in a letter to all of you on this with two suggested conditions to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10570)|
| 2:56:16| We are glad to see that there's a common area included in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| I think you should add two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10580)|
| 2:56:21| One would be to require any disturbed areas in the common area to be reforested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10581)|
| 2:56:26| And the second condition would be prior to final applied approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10586)|
| 2:56:30| require the developer to submit a plan to KKCP staff for the common area dog park and picnic area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10590)|
| 2:56:36| with those fencing, landscaping, and picnic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| We do think it's really important to include the reforestation as a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10599)|
| 2:56:44| so that that can be an item that Knox County Engineering Public Works looks at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10604)|
| 2:56:50| Potentially, it requires that to be included in their performance bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| And that would actually ensure that that reforestation would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10614)|
| 2:56:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| Mr. Fulgham, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10622)|
| 2:57:06| Billy Fulgham, 10330 Hardin Valley Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10626)|
| 2:57:11| You have five minutes, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| Okay, I'll just respond to Kevin's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| One, he wanted the reforestation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| It will be in the open areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10640)|
| 2:57:26| And also, it is tied to the stormwater bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10646)|
| 2:57:31| So there is accountability and a performance measure in place already to make sure that it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10651)|
| 2:57:38| And then, as far as the amenities, I'm not real sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10658)|
| 2:57:47| I mean, somebody, how does that typically go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| I'm not really sure how to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| I'm not seeing a bond on the amenities yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10671)|
| 2:58:00| Other than that, I don't have any other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| I agree with what staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| I'll just address the amenity real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| I think what Kevin, and you might be able to correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10688)|
| 2:58:14| but I think he was just wanting to have the developer submit plans for the amenity to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10694)|
| 2:58:20| for planning staff to review before the property has a final plan recorded for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10700)|
| 2:58:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| I have a question for Mr. Fulgham, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| Looking at the grading plan and the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| I'm maybe a little confused about Mr. Murphy's comment about reforestation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10724)|
| 2:58:49| because it looks like that 12 acres is not being graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10729)|
| 2:58:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10733)|
| 2:58:54| So are you going to disturb that 12 acres or is that remaining undisturbed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10734)|
| 2:59:00| Yeah, it's undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10740)|
| 2:59:01| You can see right there where the proposed contours are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10741)|
| 2:59:06| Those slopes, cut and fill slopes will be reforested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10746)|
| 2:59:10| The rest of that whole area will be undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| Commissioner Smith, Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10757)|
| 2:59:22| Yeah, I was just going to say it looks like a very nice plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| I don't have any issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10766)|
| 2:59:27| I'd like to make a motion we approve variances one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10767)|
| 2:59:30| because topographic constraints and site conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10773)|
| 2:59:36| and will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10778)|
| 2:59:42| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| second by Commissioner Browning to approve variances one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10785)|
| 2:59:49| because topographic constraints and site conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| and will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10795)|
| 2:59:58| Our chair recognizes Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10798)|
| 3:00:05| Yes, I wanted to ask the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| does he have any issue with submitting a design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10808)|
| 3:00:13| for the picnic area and dog park at the time of the final two staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10813)|
| 3:00:19| at the time of the final decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| Is that a problem for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10821)|
| 3:00:28| Uh, I'm not sure the timing of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10828)|
| 3:00:32| You're talking about right now before a concept plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| or are you talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10835)|
| 3:00:36| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10836)|
| 3:00:36| At the time you're submitting the final, the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10836)|
| 3:00:43| I'd have to talk to my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10843)|
| 3:00:44| but I don't think that that would be an issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| Then we could include that in the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10848)|
| 3:00:51| and you would be comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10851)|
| 3:00:55| Um, yeah, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| I think it, you know, it's going to be part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| I think that we would like some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10859)|
| 3:01:03| in working with the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| the future residents of it as far as the design of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| It would be kind of a travesty to design it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10869)|
| 3:01:13| without getting their input on the exact locations or exact features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10873)|
| 3:01:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10880)|
| 3:01:21| Commissioner Phillips, can we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| I don't know how to go about amending a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| but I would like to add in the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| that the applicant submits design plans to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10888)|
| 3:01:36| How do I go about doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| Well, I think Mr. Scott Smith would have to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| to the amendment to the motion and Mr. Browning who seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10901)|
| 3:01:48| Mr. Wise, would you like to weigh in on that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10912)|
| 3:01:53| We operate under specific rules under the bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| A resident can rules like Robert Schultz in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| And once a motion is on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10919)|
| 3:02:04| it's acted on either up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| And if it fails, then the next motion can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| The only opportunity to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| there is no opportunity officially to amend a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10931)|
| 3:02:16| You might be able to persuade whoever made the motion to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10936)|
| 3:02:20| and as well change the person who seconded the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| if they agreed to any revisions that occurs from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| But for a complete amendment that's not agreed to by the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| you'd have to wait for the first motion to fail and then make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| I'm a new commissioner and I'm still trying to figure out how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| So if I have an idea for an amendment to a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| when do I introduce the idea of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10966)|
| 3:02:49| Well, it's in the course of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10969)|
| 3:02:52| Generally, we encourage motions not to be made early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10972)|
| 3:02:55| in the course of commissioner's discussion until everyone has been heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10975)|
| 3:03:00| So just raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10980)|
| 3:03:01| And it works better in a non-electronic meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10981)|
| 3:03:06| because everyone can see in everyone else's eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| It's a little bit awkward this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10988)|
| 3:03:11| But generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| the commission has been able to reach generally a consensus before motions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| There are occasions when amendments are discussed subsequent to making the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=10998)|
| 3:03:23| and sometimes the movement will agree to the changes after discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11003)|
| 3:03:28| So that's your opportunity is to persuade your colleagues to change their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11008)|
| 3:03:34| to adopt your view of what the motion should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11014)|
| 3:03:39| Okay, the reason I was confused is because the motions are made so quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11019)|
| 3:03:44| that it's hard to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| I appreciate your advice, Mr. Weiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11026)|
| 3:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11029)|
| 3:03:50| The staff, I mean, the chair recognizes Mike Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11030)|
| 3:03:53| Mike, I see you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| Yes, thank you, chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11035)|
| 3:03:58| So we're only discussing the variances right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| So there's no need yet to amend the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11041)|
| 3:04:06| It's, we're just talking about the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| So once we get to the next piece of a concept plan motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11048)|
| 3:04:15| that's when you can add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11055)|
| 3:04:16| That's really where we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| Also, I want to mention in regard to the design of the amenity area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11058)|
| 3:04:25| Since there's no specific standard that the amenity has to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11065)|
| 3:04:31| other than submitting a plan to staff for review before a flat is recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11071)|
| 3:04:39| They give us something before a flat is recorded that is sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| that staff feels is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11083)|
| 3:04:46| And then, you know, two years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| or one year, whatever it is, if they decide to install it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11089)|
| 3:04:54| and they have discussions with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11094)|
| 3:04:56| or maybe the developer about the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| if the design changes a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| but still meets the intent of the original approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| that can still be reviewed and approved by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11102)|
| 3:05:06| So they're not going to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11106)|
| 3:05:08| beholden to that absolute design that first one to come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| They can still kind of modify it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11111)|
| 3:05:14| as long as they still meet the intent of the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| I appreciate Commissioner Corbett's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| because I'm feeling some of the same issue of wanting to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| and then the motions already made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| So I look forward to the in-person opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11131)|
| 3:05:35| I'd also like to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| following Mr. Reynolds' suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| that we do make an amendment to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| so that we can see the plan for the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| We have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| motion by Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| second by Commissioner Browning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11154)|
| 3:05:57| approve variances one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11157)|
| 3:05:58| because topographic constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11163)|

| 3:07:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11259)|
| 3:07:40| We're now on to the concept plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| subject to four conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| I think this is the opportunity, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| if you want to make any additions to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11271)|
| 3:07:53| Yeah, I just wanted to discuss a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| about what Commissioner Corbett was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11275)|
| 3:07:59| But so I guess what I'm trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11279)|
| 3:08:03| is you would want the amenities put on a design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11283)|
| 3:08:08| or could we not just locate them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11288)|
| 3:08:12| The PR zone, my understanding, doesn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11292)|
| 3:08:16| require amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11296)|
| 3:08:17| It requires open space for activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11297)|
| 3:08:21| which I think this development seems to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11301)|
| 3:08:24| quite a bit of common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| And I'm just not sure doing what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11306)|
| 3:08:31| called a design plan for, is it the dog park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| and what was the other amenity that is necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11314)|
| 3:08:40| I think the requirement is for usable open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| And so I think what we're trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| is how is he going to present the open space to be usable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11327)|
| 3:08:52| It isn't enough just to have vacant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11332)|
| 3:08:55| if it's overgrown with weeds and thickets and trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| It needs to be, you need to be able to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11338)|
| 3:09:03| Well, I mean, would you have them clear the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11343)|
| 3:09:06| Or I guess what I'm saying, I kind of like the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| of having a wooded 12-acre common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| And I'm trying to understand what the amenity was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11353)|
| 3:09:22| What is the purpose of having a design plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11362)|
| 3:09:24| I probably know from the applicant's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11364)|
| 3:09:26| to have a picnic area and dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11366)|
| 3:09:29| And I simply wanted to know what that was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11372)|
| 3:09:40| Yeah, commissioners, this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11380)|
| 3:09:42| we've been wrestling with now for the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11382)|
| 3:09:46| And I think right now, so on the executive planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11386)|
| 3:09:51| the executive committee has requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11391)|
| 3:09:54| and the staff's agreeing to look at the PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11394)|
| 3:09:56| and see how we can be a little more definitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11396)|
| 3:10:00| on some of what these amenities look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| But I think right now it's very general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11403)|
| 3:10:07| And again, we're starting to get a little bit arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| in how we approach these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| I think you may have just said what I was gonna say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11416)|
| 3:10:18| but I thought the executive committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11418)|
| 3:10:19| was looking into a process of looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11419)|
| 3:10:22| more clarification for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11422)|
| 3:10:23| But also wanted to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11423)|
| 3:10:28| I do think having forested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11428)|
| 3:10:31| having just forested unprogrammed space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11431)|
| 3:10:34| on that steep hillside is quite a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11434)|
| 3:10:37| I would love that personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| So I think that's a great thing to have is undisturbed forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11439)|
| 3:10:44| Thank you, Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| I believe what Commissioner Korbelik is referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| is the area close to the mail kiosk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| And that is where it says potential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11455)|
| 3:10:57| for dog park and gazebo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| So I don't think she's referring to the forested area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11459)|
| 3:11:04| So I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11464)|
| 3:11:06| And second thing, not to rush anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| but is there a timeline for reviewing planned residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11469)|
| 3:11:13| Reason why I ask is because I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| we are kind of getting into a back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| and it kind of holds up progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| But I think that that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11480)|
| 3:11:23| is gonna continue to happen until we've kind of resolved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11483)|
| 3:11:27| So I just was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| Commissioner Dent, I would agree with your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11490)|
| 3:11:33| And I guess Gerald's on his 11th hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11493)|
| 3:11:38| and he's gonna be leaving us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11498)|
| 3:11:39| But I would ask Amy Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11499)|
| 3:11:43| who will be assuming the role of interim director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11503)|
| 3:11:48| if she has an idea of when the PR zone might be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11508)|
| 3:11:54| This is Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| I will say that I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| a specific timeline laid out right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11518)|
| 3:12:00| but we have had initial conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11520)|
| 3:12:03| with Knox County about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11523)|
| 3:12:07| And we have some initial ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11527)|
| 3:12:10| and we'll be getting together in the next few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11530)|
| 3:12:12| to lay out what that might look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11532)|
| 3:12:15| and who needs to be involved in those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| There will be a community involvement piece to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11538)|
| 3:12:20| So I don't see this as something that can happen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| We are gonna need some time to flesh it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11543)|
| 3:12:26| and have some conversations with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11546)|
| 3:12:28| and the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| So I would anticipate in the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11550)|
| 3:12:33| but I wouldn't expect us to have something before the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11553)|
| 3:12:36| you know, three to five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11556)|
| 3:12:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11561)|
| 3:12:42| Just, so would just a general location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11562)|
| 3:12:46| like maybe on the plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11566)|
| 3:12:48| because after this stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11568)|
| 3:12:49| once this concept plan is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| it's gonna go to design, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| They're gonna work the engineers with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| and design the roads and the drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| And after that, I would think that the engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11577)|
| 3:13:00| and this is kind of a question for the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| would you be able to locate those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11582)|
| 3:13:04| at the final plat stage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11584)|
| 3:13:07| Applicant, Billy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| Yeah, I think that would be a better time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11589)|
| 3:13:13| Then we'd have a better idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11593)|
| 3:13:14| of what the future residents are looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11594)|
| 3:13:17| and we'll have more flexibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11597)|
| 3:13:20| But yeah, and I guess having an amenity in the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11600)|
| 3:13:25| it seems like that's a built-in requirement already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11605)|
| 3:13:29| because if we don't provide the amenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11609)|
| 3:13:30| then we're not consistent with the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11610)|
| 3:13:33| That maybe that's just a question or a statement either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11613)|
| 3:13:37| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11617)|
| 3:13:41| Just confirming what Commissioner Dent said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| about needing to get a timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11624)|
| 3:13:46| and I appreciate Ms. Brooks speaking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11626)|
| 3:13:49| It sounds like we've got roughly a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11629)|
| 3:13:53| before we could have in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11633)|
| 3:13:56| what those actual guidelines would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11636)|
| 3:13:58| which seems it would be a year of developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| that would be in line with the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11640)|
| 3:14:05| But I think that either don't have that kind of guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11645)|
| 3:14:10| or if we have amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| like Commissioner Kovelik was suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| we have the opportunity for it to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| and look at that again to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11657)|
| 3:14:20| it's meeting the requirements that we are shaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11660)|
| 3:14:24| It seems reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11664)|
| 3:14:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11667)|

| 3:14:35| you got me a little bit shy about making a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| because I'm not sure when it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| You know, do all hands need to be down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11680)|
| 3:14:43| But I'm going to go ahead and make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11683)|

| 3:19:37| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11977)|
| 3:19:40| First there are two technical things that I emailed you about or four, but two in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11980)|
| 3:19:46| There's a label that says common area stormwater facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11986)|
| 3:19:49| And I think you need to ask the applicant about, you know, is it actually any common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11989)|
| 3:19:52| area or is it 100% stormwater facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11992)|
| 3:19:57| And then between lots 24 and 25, you need to see if there's a drainage access easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=11997)|
| 3:20:02| but, you know, is that going to be a paved sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12002)|
| 3:20:04| That's a common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12004)|
| 3:20:05| So I think you've got some questions to ask about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| Secondly, more importantly, I'd send over a stormwater briefing email to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12007)|
| 3:20:13| I believe I was in a discuss with former planning commissioner Laura Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12013)|
| 3:20:19| This Shining Creek East, it drains into sinkholes and it drains into sinkholes that are along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12019)|
| 3:20:24| some parcels that are adjacent to her backside of her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12024)|
| 3:20:26| So this is an area of known flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12026)|
| 3:20:28| I think it's incumbent upon the planning commission to actually ask some hard questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12028)|
| 3:20:32| of engineering public works, find out, is this an area of known flooding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12032)|
| 3:20:36| This is an area that drains into sinkholes and what kind of stormwater, you know, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12036)|
| 3:20:42| they going to require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12042)|
| 3:20:43| Do they require full retention of stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12043)|
| 3:20:45| Do they require detention and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12045)|
| 3:20:48| I know the committee will talk about common areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| So I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12050)|
| 3:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12052)|
| 3:20:53| Mr. Chittum, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12053)|
| 3:20:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12057)|
| 3:20:58| My name is Wendell Chittum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12058)|
| 3:20:59| My address is 117 Neils Landing Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12059)|
| 3:21:04| I have two areas of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12064)|
| 3:21:09| The first area is the area behind the commercial building, slots one through 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12069)|
| 3:21:20| That grade has been raised by eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12080)|
| 3:21:24| In the rainy months, this area is very prone to flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12084)|
| 3:21:27| I've actually stood on my back porch and it looks more like a lake down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12087)|
| 3:21:36| Due to the increased grain of the land, my major concern is that my property will flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12096)|
| 3:21:42| The water has nowhere to go, nowhere to collect at other than backing up into my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12102)|
| 3:21:48| which leads to my second concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12108)|
| 3:21:51| The proposed retention pond, which is slated to be located between some of the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12111)|
| 3:21:55| neighborhood properties and the creek, I believe that is on down at the entrance area, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12115)|
| 3:22:05| I said, 117 and the next three or four houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12125)|
| 3:22:10| That's where that retention pond is proposed to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12130)|
| 3:22:15| Since the grade of the land that's in lot one through 18 has been raised, all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12135)|
| 3:22:22| water is going to back up onto my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12142)|
| 3:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12146)|
| 3:22:28| Ms. Hoskins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12148)|
| 3:22:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12150)|
| 3:22:32| My name is Michelle Hoskins and I live at 361 Northwood Dale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12152)|
| 3:22:41| My property butts up to Neils Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12161)|
| 3:22:45| My concerns are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| One is there's a hill here and I want to know how are they removing this hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12167)|
| 3:22:52| Is this going to constitute blasting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12172)|
| 3:22:54| And if so, what ramifications will that have against my home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12174)|
| 3:22:59| When I built my home in 2008, I built it above what most people have in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12179)|
| 3:23:05| I brought value to this property, to these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12185)|
| 3:23:09| What they're building is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12189)|
| 3:23:10| I don't want my house damaged due to blasting and I know people in Neils Landing do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12190)|
| 3:23:15| want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12195)|
| 3:23:17| The other issue is that's 141 homes on 25.1 acres of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12197)|
| 3:23:25| Basically they have the basketball size court of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12205)|
| 3:23:28| Why can they not build better comparable homes to what exists in Neils Landing, what my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12208)|
| 3:23:36| butts up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| Why can we not build homes that look like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12217)|
| 3:23:39| Why do we got to look like we're squeezing a round hoe into a square peg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12219)|
| 3:23:45| Why can we not build better homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12225)|
| 3:23:48| This may be East Knoxville, but we take pride in our homes and the conditions of our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12228)|
| 3:23:53| and the way our homes look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| I have other areas that I could discuss because you're talking 141 homes, that's two vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12235)|
| 3:24:01| per home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12241)|
| 3:24:02| That's a minimum of 282 vehicles with one entrance out to Asheville Highway, cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12242)|
| 3:24:08| the street to Breakville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| I'll also notice that their transportation impact study shows that they want to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12251)|
| 3:24:17| Breakville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| That might fall on TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12259)|
| 3:24:20| I don't know, but there's homes that reside alongside those roads, so are you taking their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12260)|
| 3:24:24| property as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| I think there should be a more in-depth study when it comes to the traffic coming out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12266)|
| 3:24:30| that subdivisions, the accidents that are going to happen, and the number of the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12270)|
| 3:24:36| that are in there that are not even comparable to what Mills Landing has and what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12276)|

| 3:24:46| I sent quite a few emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12286)|
| 3:24:47| I apologize for all that spam, but I think our biggest, one of my biggest concerns is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12287)|
| 3:24:48| the common area, the lack of common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| The original plan was 124 houses with the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12289)|
| 3:24:50| I think that's a little bit too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12290)|

| 3:25:17| I tried to outline my concern in the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| So I guess I can refer people to the email I sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12319)|

| 3:25:25| And I'm happy to work with the developer of the HOA to, you know, work through the issues concerned about the size of the lot and it doesn't match the current neighborhood feel, even though that's what the paperwork sort of said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12325)|
| 3:25:45| Mr. Stanton, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12345)|

| 3:25:49| P.O. Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12349)|
| 3:25:54| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12354)|
| 3:25:55| And I want to mention that we appreciate the opposition's time and discussion on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12355)|
| 3:25:59| A couple of things, try to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| This is a revised conceptual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| So we actually already have an approved concept plan, as I believe each of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| And I did pretty much the same size lots of the original concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| So no real difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| The additional lots in this current concept that's in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12373)|
| 3:26:16| It was actually supposed to be a smaller, separate phase of the development, but we hit a very large amount of rock on the side, which is obviously no surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12376)|
| 3:26:23| But so we ended up coming together with our engineers to create this redesign to avoid as much rock as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12383)|
| 3:26:29| And back to, I guess, Mr. Murphy's flooding comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12389)|
| 3:26:33| As I'm sure most of you are aware, the stormwater issues and designs are obviously handled through our certified and licensed engineers in conjunction with the Knox County Public Works and Engineering Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12393)|
| 3:26:43| And those current requirements are very robust and many, many precautions are taken to prevent future flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12403)|
| 3:26:50| And as I guess is already on site, there's a very large tension pond that we've begun putting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12410)|
| 3:26:57| And also note that from an engineering standpoint, we're not allowed to discharge water at a faster flow rate than it was pre-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12417)|
| 3:27:03| So our ponds will actually flow either slower to or equal to pre-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12423)|
| 3:27:10| And so our hydrology report actually shows that our post-development flows will be slower than pre-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12430)|
| 3:27:16| And a lot of that comes in with raising the grades, like the gentleman mentioned, and getting all that water through storm drainage to those ponds so they can eventually discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12436)|
| 3:27:27| And the six homes that are near the pond, I guess, is closer to the entrance of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12447)|
| 3:27:33| Those should not be in jeopardy as a result of the pond because those finished floors are still higher than the 100-year flood levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12453)|
| 3:27:40| And our engineers, as well as Knox County, make sure to confirm this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12460)|
| 3:27:44| And so Leo, I don't know if I want to make sure I'm saying everything correctly, but that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12464)|
| 3:27:51| Yeah, we didn't get a drainage report. Leo, camera 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12471)|
| 3:27:57| We didn't get a drainage report for the whole subdivision, but we did have them run the 100-year flood coming into the subdivision behind the existing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12477)|
| 3:28:08| And there's a 25-foot buffer, undisturbed buffer required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12488)|
| 3:28:15| And the pond actually can be in the outer buffer, which is an additional 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12495)|
| 3:28:20| But their engineer ran the calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12500)|
| 3:28:23| It was, I think, 1.4 square miles up above that came to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12503)|
| 3:28:29| And he determined that the existing houses would not be flooded by the water coming to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12509)|
| 3:28:38| Thank you. Any other comments before we go to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12518)|
| 3:28:51| Question about this case, as it differs from the other case we discussed regarding flooding, where that was a big concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12531)|
| 3:29:02| With the previous case, that would be coming back to commission again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12542)|
| 3:29:07| So there would be a chance to see how the flooding impacted how many houses could be built or structures could be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12547)|
| 3:29:13| In this case, we won't be seeing it again. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12553)|
| 3:29:20| That's correct. And we wouldn't see it for this phase of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12560)|
| 3:29:25| Now, there is additional land that could be developed. So there's a chance we might see another phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12565)|
| 3:29:31| But not necessarily this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12571)|
| 3:29:36| And my second question is about the homeowners have expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12576)|
| 3:29:44| Dissatisfaction with the plan, and I'm curious because I'm jumping in the middle of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12584)|
| 3:29:51| Was there some previous plan or something else that they would have seen that would have made them believe that any other development there would be identical to what their division?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12591)|
| 3:30:01| How it is structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12601)|
| 3:30:08| The previous plan has a common area that could have been used for some kind of usable open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12608)|
| 3:30:19| You know, outside of that, I'm not sure what kind of expectation there would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12619)|
| 3:30:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12627)|
| 3:30:31| Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12631)|
| 3:30:33| I had several questions for the applicants representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12633)|
| 3:30:38| One is that one of the neighbors wrote in asking about the feasibility of a temporary and separate construction entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12638)|
| 3:30:49| As the applicant considered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12649)|
| 3:30:55| Can you hear me? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12655)|
| 3:30:58| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12658)|
| 3:31:00| I believe that's mainly up to our grading contractors and engineers just to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12660)|
| 3:31:05| How much property would have to serve in doing that and not disturb. So that's something I would have to follow up with our grading contractors with as well as our engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12665)|
| 3:31:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12673)|
| 3:31:14| What was the philosophy, the thinking behind removing the common play area, if the, if that was what was shown to the initial phase, you must have had a good reason to, to not proceed with that expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12674)|
| 3:31:32| What was that thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12692)|
| 3:31:37| Well, at least to my knowledge with the increased the smallest number of lots that were increased, we needed more retention detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12697)|
| 3:31:44| And so that eliminated a little bit of it. There will still be useful common area slash open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12704)|
| 3:31:51| So there will be a usable common area around the storm detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12711)|
| 3:31:56| My knowledge. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12716)|
| 3:31:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12718)|
| 3:31:59| Now, I had a question for staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12719)|
| 3:32:03| There was one of the proposals as a reduction of the peripheral setback to 25 feet instead of 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12723)|
| 3:32:12| I didn't see a justification or rationale for that and I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12732)|
| 3:32:19| I would have to look to see I'm assuming that that was part of the previous approval for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12739)|
| 3:32:25| I have to check and see if that is where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12745)|
| 3:32:31| I'm going to have to look that up in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12751)|
| 3:32:35| Okay. And then I'm, I have another question for the applicant. There was a, some concern or confusion about the access between 24 and 25 to the common area stormwater facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12755)|
| 3:32:51| Can you explain to me what type of easement that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12771)|
| 3:32:55| Yes, ma'am. That's a 20 foot drainage easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12775)|
| 3:32:58| Okay, so that common area is inaccessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12778)|
| 3:33:05| You will be able to access it via that drainage easement to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12785)|
| 3:33:08| But as far as pedestrians go and people actually using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12788)|
| 3:33:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12793)|
| 3:33:14| Yes, it is inaccessible. It is accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12794)|
| 3:33:18| So that drainage easement will also be a pedestrian easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12798)|
| 3:33:22| That I'll have to confirm with our engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12802)|
| 3:33:26| Well, that was my question and you're indicating it's a common area and you said that some of it can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12806)|
| 3:33:32| And I was just trying to figure out how they're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12812)|
| 3:33:37| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12817)|
| 3:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12821)|
| 3:33:42| You have your hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12822)|
| 3:33:45| Yes, I would like to address the alternate construction entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12825)|
| 3:33:50| Those are approved by TDAC through their SWIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12830)|
| 3:33:53| And the only other access would be on the parcel adjoining and they would have to cross the stream to get into this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12833)|
| 3:33:59| And we would be against doing that for the environmental damage due to the stream putting a temporary crossing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12839)|
| 3:34:07| Those ponds are in common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12847)|
| 3:34:11| I believe the purpose of that is so that all of the owners in the subdivision will be jointly responsible for the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12851)|
| 3:34:18| I think that's the only reason they're in common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12858)|
| 3:34:21| It's going to be, you know, it's going to be a big, giant basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12861)|
| 3:34:25| I don't see it being useful for, you know, play area or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12865)|
| 3:34:31| Yes, I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12871)|
| 3:34:32| I don't think the intent of those are for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12872)|
| 3:34:35| I think it is for stormwater detention and spreading the responsibility for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12875)|
| 3:34:42| Well, I may ask another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12882)|
| 3:34:44| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12884)|
| 3:34:45| So will those areas have any kind of buffering so that they're at least nice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12885)|
| 3:34:52| Yeah, there's stream buffers that are shown on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12892)|
| 3:34:56| There's a buffer at the toe of slope of that detention area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12896)|
| 3:35:01| Okay, a landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| A landscape buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12903)|
| 3:35:08| No, a stream buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12908)|
| 3:35:11| It is a buffer to protect the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12911)|
| 3:35:13| So there's no development or work takes place in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12913)|
| 3:35:16| The first 25 feet is supposed to be undisturbed buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12916)|
| 3:35:20| And the second 25 feet, you can regrade it, but it has to be revegetated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12920)|
| 3:35:25| But we would just be looking for grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12925)|
| 3:35:29| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12929)|
| 3:35:33| Mike, you have your hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12933)|
| 3:35:35| Do you have something you need to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12935)|
| 3:35:37| Yeah, I just wanted to follow up with the peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12937)|
| 3:35:40| That was in the 2018, the original approval for this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12940)|
| 3:35:44| that the peripheral setback was already approved to be reduced from 35 to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12944)|
| 3:35:49| So that's probably why there's not too much mention in the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12949)|
| 3:35:54| other than the recommendation approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12954)|
| 3:35:57| All right, thanks for checking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| Commissioner Smith, Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| Yeah, I'm not trying to rush anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12961)|
| 3:36:05| but the first motion I'd like to make is on the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12965)|
| 3:36:10| just to get them out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12970)|
| 3:36:11| So I don't think there's any issue with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12971)|
| 3:36:13| I'd like to make a motion we approve variant one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12973)|
| 3:36:16| and the alternative design standards one to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12976)|
| 3:36:18| because the site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12978)|
| 3:36:21| with the subdivision regulations and the proposed variants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| and alternative design standards will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12983)|
| 3:36:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=12988)|

| 3:37:03| Mr. Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13023)|

| 3:37:05| Mr. Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13025)|

| 3:37:08| Mr. Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13028)|
| 3:37:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13029)|
| 3:37:10| Mr. Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13030)|
| 3:37:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13031)|
| 3:37:12| Mr. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13032)|

| 3:37:14| Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13034)|
| 3:37:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13035)|
| 3:37:19| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| We have a motion to approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| subject to the ten conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13043)|
| 3:37:27| Excuse me, Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13047)|
| 3:37:28| Mr. Phillips, do you mind if I chime in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13048)|
| 3:37:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13052)|
| 3:37:33| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13053)|
| 3:37:34| And Steve Elliott, would you please help me on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| But can we talk about the sidewalks on this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13056)|
| 3:37:41| and the potential elimination of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13061)|
| 3:37:47| Yes, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13067)|
| 3:37:48| We think only the front portion would require the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13068)|
| 3:37:52| to get above the daily trips that would be needed to put the sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| And there's a bridge across the stream there that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| prohibitive of even putting the sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| So I don't think we would be in support of adding the sidewalks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13081)|
| 3:38:07| Would it be possible to remove that condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13087)|
| 3:38:10| I think that's a question for Mike Reynolds, if we can get that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13090)|
| 3:38:17| Was there a condition on the original approval for sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| Or are you just showing them on the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13100)|
| 3:38:23| The original approval, the first two approvals had sidewalks on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13103)|
| 3:38:28| So that's why they continued with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13108)|
| 3:38:32| I think Tom Breschke originally reviewed this through this application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13112)|
| 3:38:42| questioned whether or not that was the intent was to keep the sidewalks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| at the time during this review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13126)|
| 3:38:48| I guess it was their intent to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13128)|
| 3:38:51| They had no indication that they were planning to remove them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13131)|
| 3:38:55| I don't think our ordinance would require them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| other than on the main entrance to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| And the bridge there would prohibit from putting them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13140)|
| 3:39:03| without we widen the bridge out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| So I don't think it would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| The ones internal would need to be in a maintenance agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13147)|
| 3:39:11| for the homeowners to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13151)|
| 3:39:16| Hello, this is Megan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13156)|
| 3:39:17| Megan, are we able to chime in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13157)|
| 3:39:19| I'm the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13159)|
| 3:39:22| Actually, it's gone to commission for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13162)|
| 3:39:25| And we've already ran out of time for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13165)|
| 3:39:29| So I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13172)|
| 3:39:36| Yes, I'm just trying to sort this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13176)|
| 3:39:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13182)|
| 3:39:45| The subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| In total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| Would have more than 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| Units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13191)|
| 3:39:52| Historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13192)|
| 3:39:55| It has been expected when you exceed that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13195)|
| 3:39:59| Some sort of amenity or open space is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13199)|
| 3:40:03| The staff report indicated that the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13203)|
| 3:40:06| Would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13206)|
| 3:40:07| Be supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13207)|
| 3:40:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13209)|
| 3:40:10| You don't want sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13210)|
| 3:40:18| Who are you addressing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13218)|
| 3:40:23| That's correct. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13223)|
| 3:40:26| We would not like sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13226)|
| 3:40:30| In this interior portion of the subdivision for the reasons that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13230)|
| 3:40:32| Elliott stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13232)|
| 3:40:33| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| You've removed the common area, the play area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13235)|
| 3:40:37| And you've removed the open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13237)|
| 3:40:40| So I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13240)|
| 3:40:41| That's correct. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13241)|
| 3:40:47| The applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| I'm having meeting trouble. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13249)|
| 3:40:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13250)|
| 3:40:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13252)|
| 3:40:57| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13257)|
| 3:41:03| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13263)|
| 3:41:08| What part are we on? I don't have my sheet in front of me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13268)|
| 3:41:11| We're dealing with the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13271)|
| 3:41:13| Subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13273)|
| 3:41:16| Yes, I would make a motion to deny the concept plan for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13276)|
| 3:41:19| And the reason is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13279)|
| 3:41:23| It's just not compatible with the expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13283)|
| 3:41:27| I don't know what the reason is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13287)|
| 3:41:30| I'm not comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13290)|
| 3:41:32| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13292)|
| 3:41:33| Mr. Elliott said that he was removing the promised area in order to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13293)|
| 3:41:37| Provide stormwater for more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| And is now removing the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| I just, I'm not comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13301)|
| 3:41:45| I'm not a very good reason, but it's my reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13305)|
| 3:41:48| Maybe the commission can help me with this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13308)|
| 3:41:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13312)|
| 3:41:55| I would make a motion to deny the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13315)|
| 3:41:58| Subject to the 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13318)|
| 3:42:00| Is there a second to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13320)|
| 3:42:01| Corbett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13321)|
| 3:42:02| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13322)|
| 3:42:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13323)|
| 3:42:07| Second by Karen Adams, commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13327)|
| 3:42:11| Mr. Wise, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13331)|
| 3:42:21| It's a, it's a move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13341)|
| 3:42:24| So, yes, it's to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13344)|
| 3:42:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13347)|
| 3:42:28| You're muted right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13348)|
| 3:42:32| I am voting yes to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13352)|
| 3:42:35| Mr. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13355)|
| 3:42:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13356)|
| 3:42:37| Mr. Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13357)|
| 3:42:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13358)|
| 3:42:39| Mr. Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13359)|
| 3:42:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13360)|
| 3:42:41| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13363)|
| 3:42:44| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13364)|
| 3:42:47| Before I comment, I just want to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13367)|
| 3:42:49| that the condition for the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| is one of the 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13371)|
| 3:42:54| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13374)|
| 3:43:01| So my vote is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| Mr. Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13384)|
| 3:43:09| Would you repeat the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13389)|
| 3:43:12| The motion to deny the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=13392)|
