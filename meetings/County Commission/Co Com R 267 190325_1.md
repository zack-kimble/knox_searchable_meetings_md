| 2:01:50| gave $15,000 to the Seymour Volunteer Fire Department to build a helipad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| And, unfortunately, it was used the other night to save a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| There was a car crash at about 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| so it was the first time it was ever used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| And this commission, you know, we've done something good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| We put a Lifestar helipad up at Johnson University, and we probably saved a life the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| I just wanted you all to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Wow. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7335)|

| 2:02:21| Sorry, Michelle, I can't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| Yeah, I can't see it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7343)|

| 2:02:31| Type A flu is on the rise again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7351)|

| 2:02:41| Don't be out anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7361)|

| 2:02:51| So she said, Mom, please tell everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| It's not over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| Just because we think it's spring, it's warm weather, it's back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7377)|
| 2:03:02| So I just wanted everybody to please continue to be cautious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7382)|

| 2:04:41| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| All present and accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| There are no other items on tonight's zoning agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| So, Madam Clerk, would you please call the first item before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| 2-E-19-RZ, request of RML Construction, LLP, Ryan M. Hickey for rezoning from BP Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7492)|
| 2:05:00| and Technology, TO Technology Overlay to OB Office Medical and Related Services, TO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| Technology Overlay, property located east of the intersection between Solway Road and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| Family Road adjacent to Pellissippi Parkway, Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| Mr. Green, could you provide us an update on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| The Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission voted 14-0 to recommend approval of the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7527)|
| 2:05:34| of this 32.5-acre parcel to OB Office Business with Technology Overlay with one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7534)|
| 2:05:41| The condition was that development be subject to use on review approval by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| The reason for that condition was to address the design of the project with regard to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| hillside and steep slope area on the property, also to ensure that the proposed greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7552)|
| 2:05:59| access that is identified in the Knox County Greenway Master Plan be provided in an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| location on the property during the development planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| Is there anyone opposed to this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| Commissioner Anders, you've already signed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| Yeah, I was going to make, I think we've had two different approvals being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| I guess one question, it's going through the TTCDA process, correct, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| And so that has a design approval rating as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| And so they approved it without the stipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| And if we sent it with the condition on it for review, the OB with review, it would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7601)|
| 2:06:48| through TTCDA and MPC again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| I know it's not MPC, but MPC again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| So to keep it consistent, I'm going to make a motion we approve as did TTCDA without the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| condition, approve OB without the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| Just a clarification, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| The TTCDA did have one condition, traffic impact analysis be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7625)|
| 2:07:12| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| I just don't understand that TTCDA, for you guys that don't know, is a heavily reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7634)|
| 2:07:20| process that talks about color of paint, the products to use outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| I mean, the fencing, or not the fencing, but the trees and everything goes through TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7646)|
| 2:07:34| So this is really not a, it's just preventing a double step of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| So that was my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| There's a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| I do need a second before discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| We have a second from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| What I would like to, oh, is it Beeler or Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7668)|
| 2:07:54| You spoke, but Biggs raised his hand fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| So we'll leave the motion and the second as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| So what I'd like to do is, there's probably going to be some questions on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7683)|
| 2:08:09| Before we have those questions, I would like to give you a few minutes to just kind of give us an overview on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7689)|
| 2:08:15| what you're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| So if you could, I'll give you five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| Benjamin Mullins, law firm of France McCollum Seymour, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| Representing RML Construction, who is the applicant here, this is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| we're asking to rezone this from BPTO to OBTO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7714)|
| 2:08:42| and the purpose is eventually to develop some multifamily homes on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7722)|
| 2:08:49| As the staff report says, it's consistent with the sector plan and the existing zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7729)|
| 2:08:55| and so there's no issues with any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| The zoning that we're going to here does allow, in the text of the zoning itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7738)|
| 2:09:05| up to 12 dwelling units an acre without there being the use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| which is why we wanted the rezoning but did have an issue with the recommendation of the staff and the MPC on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7750)|
| 2:09:20| and we went through all those issues with the Technology Corridor Association on that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| and one of the main things they were concerned about was the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| and we agreed we'd submit to a traffic impact study on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7769)|
| 2:09:33| They also, in their report, do talk about the slopes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7773)|
| 2:09:39| There are some slopes there that are greater than 40% and the greenway easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| I think we've already committed to dedicating property to the greenway easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| and we're going to have to work with county staff and engineering on the grading and the slopes regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| I think everything can be worked out without there being a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| and that's why we had some disagreement with the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| We still want the rezoning, but consistent with what the Technology Corridor Association recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| All right. Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| Mr. Green, do we have the documentation from the TTCDA when they approved this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7812)|
| 2:10:20| No, sir. It's not in your package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| They mentioned the TTCDA, but there's not the minutes of their meeting in your package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7823)|
| 2:10:29| So did they approve that in March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| Oh, I'm trying to find it on their agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| Okay. So let me ask you another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| At the MPC meeting when it was recommended for the use on review and the Planning Commission approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7838)|
| 2:10:48| recommended that, was there objection from the applicant at the MPC meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| Okay. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| All right. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| Mr. Green, what's the reasoning behind the condition for the requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7863)|
| 2:11:11| The initial base was that under the existing zoning, use on review is required for all development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7871)|
| 2:11:20| that if they had zoned to RP, planned residential zone, that use on review would have been required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| They're trying to be consistent with that, but more importantly, the slopes, as Mr. Mullen said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| there are slopes of up to 40% on the property, and to ensure that there was coordination between the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7891)|
| 2:11:39| their design team, and the greenway coordinator for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| and the location of the recommended greenway on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| And if we go with the motion, the county and all these will not have a say so in what's to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7906)|
| 2:11:57| There is a review by the plans review staff, the codes enforcement staff of the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7917)|
| 2:12:04| so there would be some coordination from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| I'm sure the county would include the greenway coordinator in that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| And I'm sorry, your name, sir? I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| Ben Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| Mr. Mullins, why wouldn't you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| What is your biggest objection to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| Because it looks like if you're going to put in apartments, I don't know what you're going to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| Why not do a site plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| Well, there will have to be all the coordination with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| I think all that can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| The issue we have with the use on review is it just adds another level of expense, complexity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7951)|
| 2:12:37| and unpredictability in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| So that's something that we would want to avoid just because we never know what will happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7959)|
| 2:12:46| if it comes up to a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| We're moving into a zone where it allows up to 12 dwelling units an acre without a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7969)|
| 2:12:55| If we do more than 12 dwelling units an acre, then a use on review would kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| That's the way the existing zone is that we're being rezoned to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| But I've been through many of these, and it's unpredictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7984)|
| 2:13:10| It can be more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| It can delay the projects, and it can even stall a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| And so we would like to avoid that level of unpredictability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| and be consistent with the zone that we're moving into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=7998)|
| 2:13:22| So if I heard you right, your main reason for wanting this removed is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| that you're afraid that you'll have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| Not necessarily afraid there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| It could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| It's just unpredictable, and it's more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| And the zone we're moving into allows for up to 12 dwelling units an acre without a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| So essentially this is inconsistent with the zone we're moving into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| We have some questions about the legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| You could put conditions on rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| I've never found a case where you've actually moved a zone from it being a permitted use to a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8032)|
| 2:14:01| I've looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| I can't find a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| I've found cases where you can dedicate right away the greenway, things like that, and that's been upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| That's a valid exercise of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| I've never seen a case that go that far before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| So we have some questions about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| But basically we want to move into the zone as it is, which allows what we're doing without a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8056)|
| 2:14:23| You know, I'm reading here the conditions and any disturbance of the site, including clearing and grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8063)|
| 2:14:31| You know, I've got ‑‑ there's been zonings in my area that actually the stuff's been cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8071)|
| 2:14:39| before there's even an approval for a grading permit and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8079)|
| 2:14:43| It seems like we're more of a let's ask forgiveness than permission type deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8083)|
| 2:14:48| So I see that right there, just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| I see this as a safeguard for the Howe Hardin Valley community to make sure that your plans meet the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8091)|
| 2:14:58| and that you don't go in there and you start cutting down trees and grading banks and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8098)|
| 2:15:03| and they're going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Well, why did you all let them do that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| Do you understand what ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| Mr. Hickey, you wanted to add something to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| Mr. Data, I think I want to point out that all of our plans and everything will still be approved by county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8116)|
| 2:15:24| So we'll have to pull a grading permit before we can do any land disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| County engineering will have to approve everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| The only step that's, as Mr. Anders pointed out, is TTCDA will review the aesthetics of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8132)|
| 2:15:41| the trees and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| County engineering will then look at our plans, our stormwater plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| We're just trying to get the step out of an additional step that's just basically redundant of TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8146)|
| 2:15:54| We're not trying to sidestep the government in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| I still expect county engineering will approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| At TTCDA, what they wanted was a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| and what I committed to them was to do that to a level that satisfied them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| and we'll make those improvements that are determined in that traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8172)|
| 2:16:21| Commissioner Daley, any other follow‑up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| Okay, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| This has to do with your statement regarding the traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8186)|
| 2:16:31| that is going to be required and completed by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| Will that then affect the number of 12 dwelling units per acre that will then impact this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8194)|
| 2:16:42| Well, the 12 units to the acre is a number that's in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| That is the maximum allowed without a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| You can get higher density if you get into a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| Right, that's where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| We intend to stay under the 12 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| In order for the engineers to do, we'll have to give them the exact number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8218)|
| 2:17:05| and then they'll figure the traffic volume and the improvements needed off of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| That's the direction I'm trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| All right, thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| So with the TTCDA's approval, they would not require a greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8245)|
| 2:17:37| They would look at the plans and work with the greenway coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| We could work with the TTCDA to ensure that the greenway were located as proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8262)|
| 2:17:50| on the greenway master plan and as approved or recommended by the greenway coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| Okay, but under a use on review, there would be no maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| There would be no maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| And then what about the slope protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| That would be up to the TTCDA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| We could look at that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| That would just be a recommendation where under the use of review would be a requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| The TTCDA plans have to be developed as approved by TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8299)|
| 2:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| Is there some part of the use on review that they would agree to but?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8311)|
| 2:18:41| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| Let me think this through a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| Mr. Skinmaker, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| I've committed to TTCDA and MPC and the Knox County Greenway Coordinator that we will give them the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8328)|
| 2:18:55| They want a greenway along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| There's a creek that runs through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| We've committed to give them an easement through the entirety of the property on location that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8338)|
| 2:19:04| So I just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| Commissioner Anders, do you mind if I weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8350)|
| 2:19:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| Some of the concerns on this are we've got a hillside slope protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| We've got your expressed interest in creating a greenway for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| If we wanted to kind of have our cake and eat it too on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| is it possible for you to communicate those obligations to the TTCDA and subject it to their approvals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8366)|
| 2:19:36| Also, secondly, I'm going to ask Jim Snowden to address the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| and how that would look in terms of working with you on any kind of engineering plans that would result in honoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8381)|
| 2:19:49| I know our planning commission does their best to fulfill the goals of our hillside and slope protection commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8389)|
| 2:19:58| So, Jim, could you kind of give me your take on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| Is it specifically towards the slopes of the hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| And if you would see that as part of your purview when approving these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| to make sure that the hillside and slope stuff is part of your back of your head when you're looking at their plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8409)|
| 2:20:16| could you talk to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| And Ryan kind of categorized it accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| We are going to look, before we issue a grading permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| we are going to check to make sure that grading is outside of those steep slope areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| and that his stormwater and both water quality and water quantity meets all our stormwater ordinance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8430)|
| 2:20:38| So from that perspective, from a design perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| we will make sure that his plan complies with all the standards set aside in the minimum subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8441)|
| 2:20:48| as well as our stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| What about the slope and hillside protection plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| Is that something that you'll review as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| Our department looks at that in regard to areas that grading is not permitted in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8458)|
| 2:21:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| And I'm not an expert on the TTCDA, but it sounds like they've gotten that first step of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| Now, once this step of approval from them happens, does that mean they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8471)|
| 2:21:16| forgive me for my naivete on that particular approval body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| but does that mean you've gone through the step of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| and is it going to go back to them as this moves forward or are they kind of done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| They have received their approval from TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| It will go back to them for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| Everything goes back for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| So it goes back to them for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| So they've gotten the approval and then before moving forward it goes back to them for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| back to that staff of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| But would they review if this body said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| we'd like to make sure that the standards around the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| and the hillside protection are followed through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| Staff could ensure that that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| So if we put this, it would not be part of use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| but if it was expecting that to be part of their purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| is that something that this body could consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| My opinion is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| I would defer to the attorney to ensure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| Clean-shaven Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| Could you clarify your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| You know, I don't, and I'm not going to assume that my fellow commissioners know a whole lot about TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| because I don't, I'll admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| But if this has to go back to them for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| and I'm trying to frankly have our cake and eat it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| because if we're going to put an undue burden through use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| is it possible to have some of these requests to comply with the hillside protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8558)|
| 2:22:44| and to make sure that there's a greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| Is that something that could be covered in the secondary approval through this TTCDA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8566)|
| 2:22:57| Well, take them one at a time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8577)|
| 2:23:01| The hillside protection plan is something that the engineering department is going to administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| through the stormwater regulations and the grading regulations that already are in place and must be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8585)|
| 2:23:13| There is not to my knowledge any specific requirement for a greenway anywhere on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| but from my hearing of the testimony, the landowner and the developer are willing to agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8598)|
| 2:23:28| That could be imposed by commission per Mr. Mullen's earlier statement as a specific condition on this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8608)|
| 2:23:42| I'm not trying to mediate this, but if that gets commissioned to yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| then that's definitely something that could be imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| Telling TTCDA to do something in my mind raises an issue because TTCDA has its own authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8630)|
| 2:24:00| This commission has a separate authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| It can impose conditions on rezoning, but I don't know that it can impose conditions on TTCDA's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8643)|
| 2:24:11| Thank you for that. I just want to get all that out there and clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| Moving up and on, I'll go ahead and call on Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| A question for Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| So, OBTO 14 and under, 14 units per acre and under does not require use on review, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8663)|
| 2:24:31| 12 and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| 12 and under does not require use on review, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| This is something that we've added on top of this property to deal with steep hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8676)|
| 2:24:44| and the potential to work with the greenway coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| So we've added that as a staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| And TTCDA is another layer of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8691)|
| 2:24:58| I'm just trying to not have double review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| And I know what you're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| Then why do we need double review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| And I think it randomly, I think MPC at times randomly adds things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8706)|
| 2:25:12| attaches something, conditions, because they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| Because it's, I mean, in reality, it's a revenue stream for you to get another review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| It costs more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8719)|
| 2:25:20| I don't think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Now, let me finish my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| When we're getting everything we need, we're getting a commitment from the landowner for the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| which is not required, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| I mean, it's just an amenity that helps us all, and he's doing it out of the graciousness of his heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8730)|
| 2:25:36| Doesn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| The Department of Engineering has already said here and told you they're going to deal with the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8738)|
| 2:25:44| to protect stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| They've already committed to a traffic study, so there's nothing to gain by this next review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| I'm just trying to, we make it so hard for people to move into this county sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8750)|
| 2:25:57| that it makes no sense to me to add another layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| Okay, now I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| The hillside protection plan is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| It's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| It's not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8765)|
| 2:26:06| And I would defer, I'd like this question to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| If they came in and wanted to grade the entire site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| is there anything in their stormwater plan permitted it, addressed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| Is there anything in your regulations which would prevent them from grading the entire site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8776)|
| 2:26:26| They could grade the entire site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| but there would be additional stormwater controls they would have to install to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| So they can clear the, you're right, it is a plan, not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8793)|
| 2:26:38| But if they were to clear the entire site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| that would change the stormwater that they would have to manage on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| So, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| What we were trying to do, it was not a randomly selected condition to generate revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| It was trying to ensure that the hillside would be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| That was the one avenue we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| The hillside protection plan is just that, a plan, not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| That was the key there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| The TTCDA, their purview is not Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| They can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8827)|
| 2:27:08| They do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| They look specifically at the issues addressed in their statute and their jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8829)|
| 2:27:17| What we tried to do, and unfortunately the only vehicle we could see to do that was use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8837)|
| 2:27:22| was to ensure these various aspects were coordinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| and looked at comprehensively as part of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| Having said that, I have no doubt that Mr. Hickey and his design team will address all those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8849)|
| 2:27:36| But what we had to be cautious of, if this rezoning is approved with no condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| that Mr. Hickey and his R.M. Development Corporation could sell the property tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| to someone who is not as conscientious as he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8866)|
| 2:27:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| And that is what we tried to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| And even with the use on review, you can't prevent them from, you can't enforce hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| The Planning Commission is part of their review and approval that plan can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| But you can't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| It is a plan, not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| The use on review standards say that the development plans must comply with all approved plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8886)|
| 2:28:17| And the plan is approved so we can rely on that to enforce the hillside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8897)|
| 2:28:23| I think we just have too many layers to open up for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8903)|
| 2:28:30| And I don't think there is any desire of them to scrape the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| I mean, that is more costly than dealing with storm water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| Yes, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| And I think, I wish there were a middle road we could take that the tools we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8919)|
| 2:28:44| weren't limited to use on review to ensure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| Commissioner Anders, are you covered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| I know Commissioner Bates, your light was on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| He was covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8934)|
| 2:28:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8935)|
| 2:28:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8937)|
| 2:28:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| Let me ask Jim a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| They say this is what we're going to build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| That plan is for that piece of property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| And if you go out there and the plan is different from what you agreed to or what we agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8950)|
| 2:29:17| what do you do at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| What if the hill slope protection is not there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| What if they move the dirt around, which they say they're not going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| What's your point from that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| Obviously we have the ability within the stormwater ordinance to issue a notice of violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| and a corrective order for them to either get back in compliance with the original plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8975)|
| 2:29:41| or possibly revise the plan to get it back in compliance with the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8981)|
| 2:29:47| So there's a couple avenues for us to get the developer back on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| So even if he sells the property to somebody else, there is a plan in place for that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=8993)|
| 2:30:00| Yes, a plan and a bond, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| So if Mr. Hickey were to proceed with the development, we would have an approved design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9002)|
| 2:30:08| with a bond for that in the event that if he sold it or something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9008)|
| 2:30:12| so the county's taxpayers would be assured that we could make the repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| or complete the grading as part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9017)|
| 2:30:20| So basically once you get the plan down there, he has to comply with it or you can stop the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9020)|
| 2:30:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| Or he has to go back through the process all over again to change the plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| I'd be a little bit more comfortable on the approval of this if the maker of the motion would consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9039)|
| 2:30:44| since we're dropping the use on review, that the motion be made to approve the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| with the stipulation that the greenway will be included in the project as per Mr. Mullen's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| Would that be part of the official motion for approval, if he would consider that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| I'm not going to encumber his land unless he so will agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| I'll include the greenway in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| Who was the second? Was it Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| Traffic plan or the traffic study and the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9077)|
| 2:31:21| And then he's got to go up and he's got to do the TTCDA approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| And the second is okay with this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9090)|
| 2:31:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9091)|
| 2:31:32| Everybody understand exactly what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9094)|
| 2:31:35| Ready for a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190325?start=9095)|
