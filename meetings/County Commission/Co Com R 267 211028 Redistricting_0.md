| 0:01:18| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=78)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| The purpose of this evening's public forum is for discussion of ordinances number 0-21-10-101SS and 0-21-10-102SS for the purpose of establishing a redistricting plan for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=105)|
| 0:02:07| We will begin with the public forum section of tonight's hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| We have four individuals signed up for public forum, and as is consistent with our rules, we will allow each speaker five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=133)|
| 0:02:24| We do not have a timer in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| I will keep the time on my phone, and I'll notify each speaker when they have about a minute remaining in their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=146)|
| 0:02:35| We do have a timer now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Yes, how about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| Okay, so we have a timer, and our first person signed up for public forum is Eric Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| Is Eric Moore here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| Okay, our second person on the list is Angel Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=175)|
| 0:03:04| Ms. Jones, if you will state your name and county of residence for us, and you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=184)|
| 0:03:13| Angel Jones, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| I'm here to speak to you as a parent who has two kids in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| I learned about the redistricting map 3B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| There was a meeting, and that was voted on, and I usually try to stay up to date with what's going on, and I had no idea until after it all happened, and I found out on Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=205)|
| 0:03:37| I feel like there's very little public input on how parents or the community members feel about the map, and how could anyone in District 1 and 2 learn about Map 3B, how much it would impact their communities, and talk with you guys about their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=217)|
| 0:04:00| And people were then also told that they could speak during the October 21st meeting by several commissioners, which that meeting didn't have public forum at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=240)|
| 0:04:08| So once again, you can't hear from your constituents of the people you're supposed to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| So we need to have transparency and community input on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| So I would please urge you to wait until November to vote for it, get community input, listen to school board members, and have transparency during this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=258)|
| 0:04:29| It impacts many families across those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you, Ms. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Our next speaker is Jennifer Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=279)|
| 0:04:49| Ms. Owen, if you'll state your name and your county of residence, and you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| Jennifer Owen, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| I am the representative for District 2 school board, but I am speaking as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| I want to be sure that I am not representing the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Redistricting could be an opportunity for commissioners and school board members to work together for the best interests of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=305)|
| 0:05:14| Instead, some of our school board members have felt that our input is not only unimportant, but unwelcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| This is especially unfortunate for our constituents, who expect us to be working toward continually improving representation in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=320)|
| 0:05:29| I hear a lot of people talking about the importance of choices for parents, but what I see is a redistricting plan that removes from many parents the ability to choose the representative for the schools their children attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=329)|
| 0:05:41| Of course, there are many areas where the representative for a person's residence is not necessarily the representative for their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| We all know that. It happens a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| However, when the opportunity for redistricting presents itself, we should be making a concerted effort to make that kind of thing better for people rather than worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=349)|
| 0:06:00| And that is what I see with Map 3B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| Of greatest concern to me is the movement of Precinct 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Looking at the map, this move makes no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| It does the opposite of compacting districts as it slices District 1 up through District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| Dividing a strong neighborhood association and a supportive school community is not in the best interest of our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| As I looked at the why of this decision, I did some math, and I'm no data guru, be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| But the math seems to be there, and whether purposeful or not, it should be incredibly concerning to this commission and to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| When you take Precinct 18 and compare the population to voter turnout, you see that Precinct 18 has a significantly lower voter turnout than any other precinct being moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=400)|
| 0:06:53| That shouldn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| However, when you also look at the precincts being moved out of District 1, you notice that they have very high voter turnout compared to those precincts being moved into District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=415)|
| 0:07:08| District 1 is gaining over 2,000 people, but losing over 300 probable voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| That's a backwards trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| If the purpose of redistricting and reapportioning is to ensure that we have one person, one vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| if it's to ensure that people are equally represented, then this map fails to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Whether intentional or not, and I assume it's not, this does not look good for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| Just looking at the map, it looked bad, but looking at the math, it looks really terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| I encourage you to reject this map tonight, to go back to the drawing board, and spend this next month really deeply digging into the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=458)|
| 0:07:46| Spend this next month finding out how these precinct moves really impact the people in the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| Then explain the impacts to all of the people in the communities being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| If ensuring that Knox County residents understand this process fully and completely is something that has a financial price tag, please consider spending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=479)|
| 0:08:08| Our communities deserve to understand exactly what you're doing and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| Parents, grandparents, and community members deserve to know and really fully understand whether the person they are voting for will be the same person they call when there is a concern in their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=494)|
| 0:08:26| If not, they deserve to know that the districting decision was made carefully, transparently, and with intentionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=506)|
| 0:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Michelle Ivester is our next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=523)|
| 0:08:52| If you'll state your name and county of residence, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Excuse me, I'm sorry, I wasn't planning on being here tonight because I'm not feeling overly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| However, I got little to no response from my email from before, so I figured it was prudent for me to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| My name is Michelle Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| I live in Knox County. Specifically, I live in Oakwood-Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| So, to be honest, I'm not really up to date on all the redistricting, but I jumped in with both feet and tried to find out as much as I could for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=554)|
| 0:09:26| When I started researching, the reason that we apparently redistrict is so that representative governments depend on equal districts to give everyone the same voting power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=566)|
| 0:09:40| State law requires all county legislative bodies to evaluate their districts at least once every ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| This ensures that the district within the county has approximately equal populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| District 2, which Oakwood-Lincoln Park is a huge part of, is currently only 0.3% deviation off of what it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=591)|
| 0:10:00| It's the least deviation of any district in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| A vote for Map B3 would shift the majority of voters more than any of the other proposed map options, thus creating the most amount of confusion for residents across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=604)|
| 0:10:21| It would seem that this committee took little to no thought on the effects of the whole school system as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| With the approval of Map B3, District 2 is being misrepresentative in regards to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| If this map is passed, everyone who lives north of Atlantic Avenue will vote for a District 1 school board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| However, all of our schools, Chris and Mary, Whittle, Fulton, would remain in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| That means that the school board representative that we would vote for won't be the one representing our child's school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| and we won't have the ability to vote for the representative who would represent our child's school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| I have grandchildren in Knox County schools. This is very, very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| The fact that this committee has disregarded the public input thus far until after the vote is also very, very troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=664)|
| 0:11:13| Our representatives are voted in to represent us, the citizens, and frankly, this process doesn't seem to be a good indicator of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| The Central Broadway corridor has distinctly represented North Knoxville in District 2 for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| I actually tried to find out how long Oakwood-Lincoln Park has been District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| Nobody seems to know the answer, but we incorporated, I believe it was in 1917, so as far as I know, we've been District 2 since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=693)|
| 0:11:42| That's a long time. A long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| Oakwood-Lincoln Park is best served by remaining in the North Knoxville District, which has generally and historically been defined as D2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| It's a definitively North Knoxville community, and I urge you not to redefine our community by removing it outside of its current district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Thank you, Ms. Ivester. Is Eric Moore here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=725)|
| 0:12:18| That is all the folks we have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| We will now move to the discussion portion of our public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=744)|

| 0:13:42| Commissioners, just for clarity, there are two agendas in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| One for the public hearing and one for the actual special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| I wanted the clerk to read into the record what we were discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| We will be opening the floor for discussion on the redistricting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| I do want to take a rare point of privilege and just read a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| I wouldn't normally do that, but I wanted to open with this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| I met with a group of constituents in my district on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| and they were concerned about moving the Ramsey and Riverdale Precincts, Precincts 78 and 79,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=855)|
| 0:14:24| out of their historic location in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| They asked me to ask the Commission to reconsider the redistricting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| I understand their frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| I understand these precincts have been a very important part of District 8 for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| I don't want their concerns to be unheard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| I shared with them that I was not happy about those two precincts moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| I understand the frustration that folks have in the Oakwood-Lincoln Park community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| about being split between two districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| I understand folks in the Ball Camp community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| their frustrations being moved out of District 6 and away from the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| I understand folks in the Ebenezer Road area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| who may be frustrated about moving into District 4 and out of District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| I understand folks in Shannondale 74 being frustrated, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| about moving out of, away from District 2 and into District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| I understand the frustrations of some people in Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| that may be frustrated for moving out of District 1 under Proposal 3B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| And I understand, although no one's expressed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I understand the frustration of some of the folks in the Hills and Fort Sumter precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| who are not part of District 7, even though they're part of Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| The point I'm making is that there are a good number of precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| that are changing districts under this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| So, as I was asked by my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| I just want to encourage my colleagues to consider very carefully your vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| If necessary, reconsider your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| This is a second reading, and what's done tonight is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| until we choose to or have to address the reapportionment of districts again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| So, with that said, the floor is open for discussion of redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Commissioner Buehler, I share your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| Like your constituents, I have many that are not happy either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| I mean, the more I look at the map, the sicker I am that I'm losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| such a big chunk of District 6 that is, in part, really, it's ball camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1004)|
| 0:16:55| Carnes, and Hardin Valley are all kind of parts of it are being ripped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| And, I mean, I don't like it one bit, to tell you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1022)|
| 0:17:10| I hope that people will understand that we are so locked in by these precinct numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| though, that it severely, severely limits the situation and the decisions that we can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1038)|
| 0:17:28| Looking at my own district, it makes much more sense for me to lose two little precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| that are on the other side in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| But as I look at it, I recognize that that is just not going to be enough numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| to get my own district down, because I think even with what I'm being left with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| even though it's reduced significantly, is probably in two years going to be out of sight again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1070)|
| 0:17:59| So, to be clear, I know a lot of people aren't happy, and some of us aren't real happy either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1079)|
| 0:18:09| I think we've all tried to do due diligence, looked hard at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| and I say that really to support your concerns in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1094)|
| 0:18:23| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Is there any further discussion? Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| I, too, would like to reiterate what both my colleagues have said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| You know, we are all here to be the voice of our constituents for each of our districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| and to do what's best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Mine, personally, are upset, as we have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Everyone here is from District 2, regarding several variations to our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| I understand we must attempt to maintain the minority majority in District 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| but doing so by splitting established communities, such as Oakland-Lincoln Park, is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| As Ms. Ivester said, District 2 went from being one that did not require any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| to one that is being changed the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| I have the utmost respect for this body and for our institution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| but not at the disservice of our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| So I do task my colleagues with really looking at this map and seeing what else we can do, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1174)|
| 0:19:43| As we get, as this portion, the discussion portion of public hearing ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| and we go into the special called session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| I will be referencing my attempt to at least alleviate some of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| but we'll speak more to that when we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| I'll be fairly brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| I told you all this is going to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| You know, a lot of people have called me, emailed me with advice, plans, and ways to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| I think we are handicapped in a lot of ways with the late arrival of the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| and one thing I want to point out is a lot of people say split precincts in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| Well, it's my understanding the only way you can split precincts in half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| is if you have a legislative body of 20 or more, and we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| We have 11, so we can't be splitting precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| You know, I went over to the people from Knox Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| to see if they could put up the district map before we registered in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1256)|
| 0:21:05| People would really be amazed at the change from that plan to where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| It's a lot more drastic than what we're looking at right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| District 3 completely changed last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| and I know it would be great if we could get our school boards, representatives, school zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1279)|
| 0:21:28| county commission districts all lined up, but that's about an impossibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| and I want to just go over the way the current 3rd District is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| In the 3rd District, there are two elementary schools that are physically located within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| Those are Cedar Bluff and West Haven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| but the people of the 3rd District go to Pond Gap, Pleasant Ridge, Amherst, Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1309)|
| 0:21:57| West Hill, Bearden, Ayl Lot, Ball Camp, and Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| The vast majority of people go to schools that are not in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| As far as middle schools, there's Bearden Middle School and Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| that are physically located in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| The kids of the 3rd District also go to Northwest, Carnes, and West Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| The only high school in the 3rd District is Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| and I would dare say that 70% of the kids in the 3rd District don't go to Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| They go to either West, Powell, Carnes, or Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| I don't think there is mathematically a way we can ever line these up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| to where everybody has a school board member, a county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| and their kid goes to a school within that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| I just don't think that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Now, when we start splitting communities, which is hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| I live in a community that's been split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Cumberland State's got split off from where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Norwood got split last time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| That happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| But what I want people that live especially in the city to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| is we're not building walls between your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| People can still get together and work on things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| We're not changing who does your zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| That's still the city's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| We're not changing who picks up your trash, who patrols your streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| We're not changing any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| You still have the same city council representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| That's not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| In some ways, it could almost be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| because now you have two at large county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| and you also have two county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| That gives you four assets to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| for things that affect you in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| You know, this has been a hard process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| and we knew we weren't going to be able to make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| And we have given people opportunity to come here and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| We didn't at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| but every one of our redistricting meetings had a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| We've got a website that you can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| How many comments have we had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| How many e-mails have you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| We could draw this out longer and longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| but we have to have a plan to the state for them to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| And Commissioner Jay has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| this doesn't lock us in for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| We can come back and make adjustments to this if we choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| I ask everybody to think about what's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| and to vote for the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| that will probably keep us out of trouble the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Excellent comments so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| And, of course, Commissioner Smith touched on the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| that we had with the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| not getting the numbers to us on a timely basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| as they had promised a year and a half earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| And, of course, in the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| I'm constrained by Loudoun County line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| water to the south and the interstate to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| And it was tough when I realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I was going to have to take the A.L. Lots precinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| and give it to my colleague, Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| because my daughter, she was in the inaugural class of A.L. Lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| I dug the footers for the playground equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| that's in the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| I did the car door openers for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| and had the most hours of any parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| that did car door openers for those three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| And you all can remember how much fun that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| So that was kind of tough to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| hey, I've got to give up the A.L. Lots precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| But I have to because there's nothing else I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| I've got to get under the 53,000 population count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| So we've all had to make some tough decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| but the way I look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| is the plan that we voted on the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| it's the only one that we can go forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| And so I'll be voting for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| I guess I hope everyone sees that we all have been struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| And it seemed like it got so contentious really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| And I want people to know that we were supposed to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| this information, what, in April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| And we got it in October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| I mean, no, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I don't know what month I'm in, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| But it is a struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| As I kept advocating for my minority majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| and it seemed like this whole thing just went down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| to a crazy route that people are hating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| and people are threatening over redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| This is not a place where anybody is going to die| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| over redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| It's serious, but we shouldn't get to this level of contention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| and threatening people over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| And I think it's all because of this Democrat-Republican fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| And yeah, I'm very tired of it because we never move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| It's like it's always hard for us to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| because we want what's best for our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| But it's like we never get to move in a positive direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| Yeah, this is frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| It's been frustrating for me, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| know how frustrating it is to our other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| And as you all know, not the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| I know people were very upset that me and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Dorette voted yes to this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| And we voted yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Well, I'm not going to speak for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| Yes, because I didn't know if it was another choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| You can hate me or love me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| I'm still going to serve the people regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| because that's what we're here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| No matter what happens, if 3B passes or 3C passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| I just hope that we all can work together and see there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| a bigger vision for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| I'm just going to end with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Are there any other comments from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| Seeing none, the chair will entertain a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| to adjourn the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| Motion by Commissioner Ward, second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1778)|

| 0:30:25| The purpose of this special session of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| is to hear on second reading ordinances number 0-21-10-101-SS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1828)|

| 0:30:43| a redistricting plan for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Before I have the clerk read the first item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| I want to look to our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| The question has come up to me in recent days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| If there are any amendments or changes or modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| or substitutions to the ordinance before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| will that constitute a substantive change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| And I will refer to Mr. Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| In my opinion, even changing one district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| would be a substantive change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| and that would require to move everything down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| another public hearing, and a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| So, yes, it would be substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you, Mr. Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1887)|

| 0:33:07| Because I would like to continue working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=1987)|

| 0:33:46| 3C does not keep the minority majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| actually lowers it to lower than it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| In your opinion, if we do not adopt a map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| that keeps the minority majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| do we open ourselves up to a lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2044)|

| 0:34:15| If we postpone this to November 18th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| and are back at first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| we would have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| when would we be able to get this completed by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| Okay, that would be second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| If there are changes, they would have to add another week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| It also has to go, even after commission approves this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| it's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| it has to go to the state comptroller for them to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And that could take how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| And in the meantime, we have petition pick up when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2098)|

| 0:35:49| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Is there any further discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2150)|

| 0:36:06| on this ordinance until November 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2166)|

| 0:40:17| We have had a substitute motion by Commissioner Durrett to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| postpone action on this until November 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| That substitute motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| We are now entertaining a second substitute motion to adopt Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2426)|

| 0:40:35| second by Commissioner, I'm sorry, that was, that is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| with a second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| And that's what's under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Yes, you have the floor, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| Since this was posted today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| I will just go ahead and briefly explain what the changes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| All it did was it put Precinct 18 back in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| It put Precinct, and put Precincts 31 and 32| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| back in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| That's the, that's all I could get to without completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| throwing other district populations out of whack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| and the minority majority, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| the minority population in District 1 to something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| atrocious, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| It is very much a numbers game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| It is very much a ripple effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| When you move one thing, it affects three other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| And so that's why I asked for the postponement to try to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| for more time to make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| Is there any further discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211028-redistricting?start=2499)|
