| 0:00:12| the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=12)|

| 0:01:47| move through this and get everybody back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| This time I would entertain a motion for approval of the minutes of our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| There may be an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| There may be an error, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| Under discussion of items of concern, Mr. Judy Barnett, now that might have been that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| gentleman's name but I don't know, I wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| The lady, Ms. Judy Barnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Definitely Ms. Judy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| I'm sorry, which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| The pages aren't numbered under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Yeah, I know but I got the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| It says Mr. Judy Barnett, I believe it should probably read Ms. Judy Barnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| As demonstrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Okay, and moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| At this time, last month's meeting, I would ask all of you to get with anti-black in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=160)|
| 0:02:48| form or fashion, your own ideas on what should be in this plan, this center type program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=168)|
| 0:02:58| that we're talking about kicking off here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| And I know several of you did, so what I wanted to do at this point is to ask Andy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| if he will kind of give us the whole group, the synopsis of the ideas and so forth that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| came in, and then we'll discuss any of those that you all desire to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=193)|
| 0:03:21| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| I was asked to accept and compile information from interested parties, primarily people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| on this committee, and to forward that to the purchasing department at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=210)|
| 0:03:41| who in turn would include or not include those comments and suggestions in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=221)|
| 0:03:53| of the language for an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| And I received comments from the following folks, Attorney General Allen, Bailey Foster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| in the Public Defender's Office, Roger Noy, Public Defender's Office, Bruce Fangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| Volunteer Ministry Center, Councilman George Wallace, City of Knoxville, and Joel Hornberger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| Cherokee Health Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| And what I'd like to do is to briefly run through what I thought were the important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| issues that were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| And what I thought I would do is start out with General Allen's comments in that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| District Attorney has identified two avenues by which diversion into a proposed center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| may occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| And the first avenue involves nine low-level misdemeanor charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| And those would be public intoxication, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, criminal trespass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| public indecency, obstructing sidewalk, 9-11 calls, aggressive panhandling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| The second avenue would involve individuals charged with more serious crimes but whom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| the Attorney General believes would benefit from entry into the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| But it would be after an initial appearance in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| And these individuals would be processed through the Sessions Court to the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| And the center personnel would then screen for entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| And if they successfully complete, then they would have those charges dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=338)|
| 0:05:47| So those were General Allen's comments around the referral process that she would be comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| with, she and her team would be comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| I received comments from Bailey Foster, who's with the Public Defender's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| And generally, I think General Allen addresses her first comment, which is to develop concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=367)|
| 0:06:16| eligibility criteria that includes a process for screening individuals that show signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| of mental illness, regardless of charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| The second issue that she raised was a process to comply with TRCRP Rule 5, I assume that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=386)|
| 0:06:37| the Tennessee Code, which governs initial appearances before a magistrate and assignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| I spoke with Sam Lee in General Allen's office, and he seemed to indicate that this is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| issue that they had talked about, and that there could be and would be a process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| And if General Allen has anything further, and if I misspeak, please don't hesitate to correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| The third item that was identified was, would family and legal counsel be available to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=429)|
| 0:07:20| who were diverted to or referred to the safety center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=440)|
| 0:07:28| I guess my personal thought, they're going to be there for less than three days, so I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| that that needs to be a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| Aftercare transitional living plans, a number of people brought that issue up, and I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| agree that there needs to be a plan for temporary as well as permanent supportive housing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| the RFP ought to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| And then the Jericho Project, which is out of Memphis, is a project that she suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=478)|
| 0:08:06| that we take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| These are comments from Roger Noy, and that was pretty much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| The earlier RFPs, the criteria was too exclusionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| I think with this two-fold process of misdemeanors versus more serious felony charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| we can address some of that exclusionary policy, but I would recommend that also in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=512)|
| 0:08:42| Roger also mentions temporary and permanent housing, which I certainly agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=522)|
| 0:08:51| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Roger would also like for us to reduce the long waiting list at Moccasin Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| He and I have had that discussion, and that's not something that I would have remotely the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| or authority to even begin to address, but I think it is an issue that we as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| and other communities around the state ought to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| Bruce Spangler recommended changing the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| I think safety center doesn't really adequately describe what we're trying to put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| and I would think a behavioral health urgent care clinic or some additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| some different kind of language to call this center that we're trying to put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=581)|
| 0:09:51| He also wanted us to look at how people are directed into the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| and so that has to be an integral part of the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| Bruce would like for us to take on the HIPAA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| Again, I'm not sure that that's a practical consideration for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| I couldn't agree with him more that we ought to have the ability to share information more freely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| but I think it's the law of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| That there be an existing link with the crisis stabilization units, I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| That there be existing links with the mobile crisis unit, I couldn't agree more with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| A referral system for mental health and addiction treatment services, I certainly agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| and a referral system for housing for case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| And then I received from Councilman Wallace his thoughts in terms of how he thought he understood what we were trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=651)|
| 0:11:05| that it would be for adults only, that it would be for nonviolent offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| with the caveat that there could be a second avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| based upon how comfortable the Attorney General and her team are with those referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| Short-term evaluation center, which is certainly what this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| A medical doctor to perform the initial screening for people who present there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| We would have to do that simply for liability to make sure that people are able medically to come to treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=695)|
| 0:11:46| Medical detox, treatment for alcohol and drug assessment, and case management oversight for those being housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=706)|
| 0:11:56| And I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| I've received a number of comments from Joel and Cherokee Health Systems and other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| that they stand ready to help in any way, shape, or form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| and that this would be a good opportunity for the community to coalesce around this particular center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=730)|
| 0:12:19| So those are the comments based upon what this committee wants me to forward to the Purchasing Department for the development of an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=739)|
| 0:12:33| But before we get that far, I would like to call on Don Jones to talk about a grant that KPD and several other agencies worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=753)|
| 0:12:46| And I think you as a committee have the results, the tentative results of that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| And it was wildly successful, and it addresses and talks about the issues that we're trying to address through this urgent care center, Captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=772)|
| 0:13:03| Do you all have a copy of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Don, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| Thank you, Mr. White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| About three, a little over three years ago, the Knoxville Police Department, in partnership with Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| received a SAMHSA grant for a three-year test period to work on an early diversion program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| And we put together a group that included the Attorney General's Office, misdemeanor probation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=809)|
| 0:13:38| the Public Defender's Office, law enforcement, sheriff's department, police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=818)|
| 0:13:46| and put together criteria for the folks that we were going to be working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| And then we had to set up a program to be able to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| And as everybody said, the numbers at the end of that were pretty impressive as far as recidivism rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=836)|
| 0:14:05| But there were things that we had to do to kind of build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| We had to build a partnership between law enforcement, whether it be the police officers on the beat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| the Attorney General's Office, Public Defender's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| working toward trying to keep some of these folks from inside the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| And I'll go through some of those numbers in a minute, and you'll see what we're going to talk about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| One of the things that we actually received accolades from, from SAMHSA during this period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| we're about a year into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| We were having a hard time with referrals, and we instituted a ride-along program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| where the mental health professionals that were staffed through Helen Ross McNabb through the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| were actually doing ride-alongs with our CIT officers one day a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| They were actually in the field with the officers responding to calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| and when they would come upon somebody that may be a candidate for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| they were doing screening right there in the field, and we were able to work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| And to kind of give you a background on how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| the program was set up with a supervisor and four case managers to work with the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=913)|
| 0:15:21| as we brought them through the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| And they also split the duties of coming out and doing the ride-alongs as well to identify possible candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| Now, like with any program, when you're dealing with mental illness and substance abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| just because we were able to bring candidates in, that doesn't mean that they stayed with the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| So we had a larger number of folks that we introduced to the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| that didn't actually involve themselves in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| One of the things we set it up for was when an officer encountered somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| with one of these minor violations like the Attorney General outlined in her report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| that we thought may have been either dual diagnosis or could have had mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| or substance abuse issues tied in with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| the officer, instead of arresting them and sending them to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| would cite them and give them the opportunity to go be introduced into this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| And if they became a member of the program, then the case managers followed them through the court process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| And if they completed everything that they were asked to complete and got themselves turned around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| then that case got dealt with in court differently than if they just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| well, I'm not interested in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| So then it goes back into the court's hands and the courts deal with it through that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| But the officers and the mental health professionals really started bonding after a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| and they were actually calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| They all had the mental health professionals' phone numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| and when they ran up on a person they thought they might be interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| they would just call them on the phone and say, hey, I've got somebody here you might want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| We've also instituted, since that time, we do once a week where we're doing follow-up checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| where somebody from Helen Ross McNabb goes with one of our CIT officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| and we go out to folks that we call them repeat callers that have issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| that like to call and talk to us about those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| and want somebody to come out and check for people that are bothering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| We actually make what we call preemptive visits and go visit with the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| and try to get them help through that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| We've been successful with that several times, getting people back into programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| or back into counseling where they'd gotten away from it and it was causing them issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| But just to give you that, combining, we worked with two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| We worked with one group for two years, and then we had another group that came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| We only worked with them for the last year but for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| The year prior to the program starting, the group of people that we worked with spent 2,186 days in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1074)|
| 0:18:05| Since they entered into the program, they spent 750 days in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1085)|
| 0:18:14| Granted, you're never going to get that number down to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| but you're trying to reduce it as much as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| That's a 66% recidivism rate drop in this small group that we worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| According to, we got figures from Knox County on what it costs to house those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| The year before, it cost $178,000 to house them, a little over $178,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| Since it started, the counties only had to pay out $61,185 to house those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| so there's immediate savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| The number of arrests the year before was 177.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Since the program, since the first year of the program, that number has dropped down to 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| That's a 67% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| Clients receiving alcohol and drug treatment, this is probably one of the most impressive numbers to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| One year prior to it starting up, 15 of them had received some kind of treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| Since then, there's been 43 received treatment, 187% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1159)|
| 0:19:27| Frequency, another impressive, as we all know when we're dealing with substance abuse issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| there are going to be people that fall back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Frequency of use before the program, 51 of them said they did something daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| whether it be alcohol or drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| One said weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Since the program, it's dropped down to 20 people daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| One monthly, eight weekly, and 23 have not used since they went into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| That's a 62% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| Referrals come from all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| KPD and KCSO field referrals from officers was about 70 during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1202)|
| 0:20:12| During the KPD ride-alongs, we had 114 referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| When we did prostitution stings, which is a difficult group to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| we were able to get 13 referrals from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| and have probably 40% of those we have been able to get help for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| and get them out of that repeated getting back out and working the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| The DA's office referred 47 people as cases came through their court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| If they identified something that we didn't catch on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| the DA's office would refer them back into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Twenty-five came from the Public Defender's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| if they saw that there was a need of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| and then the Probation Office has referred two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| We had a total of 273 referrals from all those sources during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| and 56 of them were enrolled and participated in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| Just some additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Twenty-eight clients received mental health treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| Thirty-two of the clients have secured housing that they didn't have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| Twenty-seven have obtained a primary care physician that they didn't have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| All these things are important to address this long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| Six clients have had any mental health hospitalizations, no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| They're able to go through their counseling and do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Then we had one client go to the CSU out of the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| That's basically that in a nutshell as to what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| You look at any place in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| We had people come from other parts of the country to visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| to see what we were doing with this small sample size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| but it's kind of an indicator of what you can do if you put something together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| that's successful and treats the whole person and not just the symptoms of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| You try to find them housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| You get them case management, and you get them back on the right track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| and understand that there are going to be pitfalls as you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Some people are going to relapse, and you have to deal with them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| But as time goes by, it's a marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| It's not a sprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| As time goes by, you see dramatic drops in recidivism rates and people being incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| Captain Jones, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| I would just like to say between KPD, Captain Jones, and the Attorney General's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| we had great leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| This was entirely different, unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| but I think it speaks directly to a behavioral health urgent care center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| or whatever we're going to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| In terms of the results that we might anticipate in terms of quality of life being better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| the community being better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| and that hopefully there would be a return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| So, Mr. Chairman, that concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Ms. Phippen, is your comment regarding this or the KPD program or something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| Oh, is that your line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| It's about Mr. Black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Well, let's hold that for a second because I think we've got a tiger by the tail here on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| I'd like to get all the comments in on the KPD program first, get everybody's mind clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| I know I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| I see down on the end, Mr. Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Cab, in reviewing the situations that you all dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| is there any merit in splitting alcohol and drug abuse from other forms of mental illness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| It seems like there may be a different set of strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| and on its surface that makes sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| but you guys have the experience in the field now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| so I don't know if it makes any difference or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| On the surface it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| It seems like a logical path to take one or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| but what we see in the field are if we've got someone with mental health problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| and they have gotten away from their counseling and their treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| they start self-treating themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| and then they become addicted to either prescription drugs, illegal drugs, or alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1474)|
| 0:24:43| So a lot of times you're going to see all those things in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Not every time, but the majority of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| This is really interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| One question I had is what was the grant amount that you received for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| It averaged out to about $398,000 a year, and that paid for all the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| And one of the things they were able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| and this kind of goes to one of the comments about how do we get around the waiting list at Moccasin Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| they were able to use part of those funds to pay for mental health treatment for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| with no insurance at pay-as-you-go treatment centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| They were able to use some of the funds for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| So they were able to kind of get around that 800-pound gorilla that's called trying to get into Moccasin Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| And then I guess any thoughts about continuing a similar program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| I know there are similar programs in other parts of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| that use a triage system with mental health professionals in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| Yeah, it all comes back to what we've been talking about since the first meeting, funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| A couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Ms. Vivian, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| On this where you said you have secured housing for 32 clients, where did the housing come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| Who did you work with in partnership for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Helen and Austin McNabb worked with some of their partners to work through to find them housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| because that's what they do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| They're an excellent resource to go out and pull in other groups to find folks housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1577)|
| 0:26:26| One thing you mentioned, Don, was your case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| What qualifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Were they out of the mental health field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| So you hired them or they came?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Helen and Austin McNabb did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Helen and Austin McNabb did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| So they administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| And they also have peer support folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| We've got one volunteered and one paid, I believe now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| that are former clients that have gone through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| and they actually walk through people to encourage them to stay in their 12-step programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| and things like that, to walk different people through the different steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| So this was a three-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| You've kind of alluded to the fact that you're still doing some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| so the money's gone from that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| When did it end and how are you continuing what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| And is this strictly city funding or kind of walk us through where you were in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| As far as what we do, what we do is our officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| we've trained them to go out and identify these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| and then we're just now just kind of introducing them to Helen and Austin McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| and letting them use the services that they have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| That could probably overload them over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| Maybe you can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Is Helen and Austin McNabb able to recoup through TennCare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| or whatever any of the costs for handling these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| And do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I know you're not there now, but you were there when this was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| By definition, if someone has a severe and persistent mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| then they should be eligible for TennCare because of that disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| So the short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| The long answer is that sometimes it takes quite a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| to get someone eligible for public health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| So I think we've kind of all agreed to the fact from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| that there must be something past day one, day three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| And, you know, your type of program, Cherokee's programs can figure into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1729)|
| 0:28:57| Possibly some of CARM's programs can figure into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| So you've got a little problem there with the federal dollars or government dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| But last Friday I went down and spent about 45 minutes or so, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| with Mr. Rosen in looking at the model that CARM uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| It's, from what I know about what we're supposed to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| which I don't profess to be an expert in any imagination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| but the program that he has set up there is very much akin to what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1770)|
| 0:29:40| Now, whether they opt to, you know, go for their RP, that's entirely up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| But they have a program there that everybody needs to take a look at somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| We're going to try to arrange that somewhere in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| But from intake, he has the same type of case manager set up in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| to walk them through, run them through the housing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| even into having outside health or mental, well, that's health too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| but physical and mental health folks come in to do the patient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| Also, then they can move on into job skills, this type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| And, again, he has a bed for them tonight so they don't have to sleep under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| So there's a lot of things that can work together here on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| And as somebody pointed out a while ago, it's going to take everybody working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| If we get, you know, if Cherokee's going to, I'm just throwing names out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| if Cherokee's going to handle some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| and I don't know if McNab is going to handle some of the mental health part of it, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| We need to get our basic program set up first, which is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| in talking last week with the Gold Dust twins, Andy and Randy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| I think that we're pretty much ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| We'll be by next May's commission meeting to put out a skeleton RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1874)|
| 0:31:24| which will have to be fleshed out once we get, you know, who can do it, what are their capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| Then we'll have to, this group will have to turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| and decide what can work within that framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| That's kind of the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| If somebody has anything else, I'm not sure who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| I'll start with Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| I had a question about the numbers on this chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| The one year prior to KEPD is a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| Is the since the KEPD started, is that a 27-month period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1917)|
| 0:32:17| Group one went from October of 2013 to January of 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1937)|
| 0:32:25| and group two went from February 2015 to January 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1945)|
| 0:32:36| Mr. Omby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| Mine's not really about this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Do you want me to wait still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Yeah, let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| I had a question about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| I appreciate that this is really a very difficult population to engage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| and any diverted is cost-saving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| At the same time, if my understanding is correct, there were 273 referrals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| and out of those referrals, 56 were enrolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| Do we know anything about that 217 that didn't enroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| or were there any services or any follow-up on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Because I think as we build these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| we've got to look at best practices and what's going to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| Am I interpreting those numbers correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Like you said, it's a difficult population to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| and some of them have refused it multiple occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| And then some would say, yes, I'll do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| and then the day come to be enrolled and they'd change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| We even go back and revisit with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| The officers that know they've tried to introduce them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| if they see them on the street, they stop and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| hey, have you gone to talk to them yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Oh, I'm going tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| I personally had that happen to me two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| People I know, we've tried to get into the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| and then they don't make their meeting, and we find them later on on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| Did you make your meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| No, it was a long way to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| And I said, well, you know they'll come get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Okay, you have the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Give them the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| See them two or three days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| But I lost that card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| But you just have to keep talking to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| and try to catch them when they're ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| and then we can call and get somebody to come to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Persistency pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Anything else, Dr. Noy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Dr. McKenna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Along that same line, are those 273 unique individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Okay, so it's not some of those folks who got referred a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| And then did you gather any demographic information on these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| I didn't gather the information because it becomes a HIPAA problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| That information has to be with Helen and Officer McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| because I don't even see names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| I see numbers when we talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| I would imagine on the 56 that ended up getting treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| there would be some demographic information in terms of an assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| but those that declined treatment, it would be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| The other thing that you can assume from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| and I appreciate what Roger is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| but you're talking about people who show up in the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| multiple times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| I think someone called them frequent flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| And they are known to the criminal justice system, to the mental health system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| So to treat these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| and to get that particular number to engage in treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| is, in my opinion, pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| Okay, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| Captain Jones, just one question relative to the 56 enrolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| May I assume that the 32 clients who achieved housing come from that 56?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| That's a pretty good success mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| So how many of the 56 would you estimate were experiencing homelessness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| That would absolutely be a guess on my part, and I don't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| I won't hold you to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| At least 60% were homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| I don't get a lot of them telling me they don't have a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| They say, I live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| I've got an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| I've never had anybody say, even if I get 418 North Broadway, I get an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| But it's hard to really put a pin in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| I think one of the outcomes of this study really underscores the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| that you have to have services plus housing in order for it to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| You can't have one without the other to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I totally agree, and that's why I say whether it's Cherokee, Karm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| Helen Ross McNabb, whoever else is in that business around town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| everybody's going to have to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| I believe Bill was next, and then I'll come back to Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| He's still waiting on something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| I basically have two points, Captain Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Number one, capacity on the housing end especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| was there still slack in that system that you noted as you were pursuing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| with these numbers of getting these folks taken care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| I guess my second question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| it seems a very impressive and successful program from your results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Is there anything that you would do differently or solve from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| that would lead you to alter it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| or help inform a program that we might come up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| I think if you're going to try to expand it larger than these numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| and to open it up where you get more people coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| you're going to have to have some kind of structured thing that's familiar to folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| kind of like our Family Justice Center is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| where folks know that, hey, I can get help here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Ideally, it would be nice somewhere down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| that folks don't have to get involved with the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| to get introduced into this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| They could know that there was a place for them to go before it ended up that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| and that will just as well reduce those recidivism rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| and reduce those jail rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| because they're getting help before they get into trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| You've got to have both those components there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| The housing is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Case management, I can't tell you how key that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| If you don't have somebody checking with them on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| making sure they're doing the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| they're going to backslide on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Even when you do that, you're going to have some that do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| but they know they can get back if they have somebody that they feel cares about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| The housing, in these numbers here, I don't believe it ever became an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| We were able to find housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| The biggest hurdle in here was finding the long-term mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| or substance abuse treatment if the person didn't have insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| because it just doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| We were fortunate enough that they were allowing us to use some of those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| to do that, to kind of get around that for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| and helped them become successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| Any other questions on KPD's program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| Let me get one final one in, Commissioner Norman, and then I'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| I'm assuming from what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| you're still continuing this program on a smaller scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| because you don't have the big budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| That's a pretty good assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| But we're still working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| We've built a really good relationship, and we understand the importance of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| and the officers, especially the CIT officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| understand that we have resources out there that we can get these folks to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| There's not a day goes by where we're not referring somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| to try to get them in the door there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| So basically what you're doing, though, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| is this in your normal annual police department budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| It's not a separate line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| No, we don't have money set aside for a program, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| Okay, that's what I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| The money was set aside basically for them to hire the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| or the case managers, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| It never was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| We do our stuff in our day-to-day business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| We spent time training officers in CIT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| and helping them identify folks that are out here that can be referred into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| It was an eye-opening for a lot of the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| And I don't want to act like I'm correcting you, but it wasn't a KPD program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| It was a program between the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| you know, Helen Ross McNabb, the DA's office, the judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| the probation office, public defender's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| There was a large group that worked on that to make it successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| If we hadn't had that group being able to sit down in a room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| and there were a couple of times, you know, chairs got thrown and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| and really mean looks got thrown around a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| But we were able to put together a package that was successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| because we had a group of people that sat down and really wanted to get the job done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| and saw the need to give these folks an avenue other than just going to jail, getting out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| going to jail, getting out, going to jail, getting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| And, you know, if you can find 20 people homes and get people treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| and turn their lives around, you know, like I said before, it's not a sprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| You know, we're going to catch everybody the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| But, you know, 10, 15, 20 years down the road, are we seeing an impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| Yes, probably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Worth the investment 20 years down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| Yeah, I think I keep saying KPD, but I should be saying KEDP, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| I think it was a great thing that you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| and I'm appreciative of the fact that you're trying to continue with as much of it as you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| with your limited budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Anything else under this particular KEPD program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| Commissioner Warmbier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| We forgot what to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| I think this is a great program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| and I think it's a lot of stuff that we can use to mirror what we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| because, I mean, it's already been invented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| We can take from this and kind of expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| And that's kind of what I said in my email that I sent to Mr. Black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| was that he covered a lot of what I sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| Case management, I can't say, that's the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| If we don't have case management, then none of this is even worth venturing out to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| because if you don't have that, you're not going to accomplish anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| And I think in RFP that we do need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| even if we're not going to venture into the juvenile mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| we're going to have to make that an aspect of the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| because we will eventually have to get into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| because that is a growing population as well in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| Mr. Jerry asked you, I don't want to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| but I know right now you all are on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| in that you're taking a lot at Tenova of the PDKPD inputs up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2630)|
| 0:43:59| How far do you go, if you don't want to answer this, you can say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| how far do you go with the thought of this type of program with what you're doing there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| Is it just three days and out, or are you processing them to case management in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| or how are you handling that, your folks handling that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| Well, it would depend on the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| For those who have significant mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| or some kind of mental condition that we believe has a long-term consequence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| then we're going to be waiting for a placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| And that can take days and days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| I keep hearing the average of 30 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| I wish we were at 30 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| We're probably significantly over that in terms of holding people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| So our big challenge is getting an appropriate placement for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| But if they come in and the symptoms that brought them there go away while they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2700)|
| 0:45:11| it's also possible that we could release them to a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| Do you have the capability to hold them that week, two weeks, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| In fact, that's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| We have one room and another one that we can't use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| and as many as we have, we have to put them all in that same room for the safety of the other patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| And we are constantly, well, you just have to come and see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| But when you put a person who has significant mental illness into a room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| with a bunch of other people who have significant mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| some of whom are violent, many of whom are loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| and there's virtually every combination you can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| Our problem, that's a different problem from what the safety center is going to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| Now, the safety center may help because there are a number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| who may go to the safety center for two or three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| and be able to find an appropriate pathway of care for them before they come to the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| That would be the hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| But we have a ton of people who come in not from the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| We have a lot of people who walk in or are brought in by a family member or by EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| So this can only help us, but it's one small piece of the pie for our issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| Until we get more availability of placements for people who need to be involuntarily committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| we won't really put a significant dent in, but this will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Every bit helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| I'm more supportive of this because it's the right thing to do for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| It's great if it reduces our numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| but it's the right thing to do regardless of whether it reduces our numbers in the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| But that's a huge issue, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Well, you mentioned about being a piece of the pie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| and when we get all these pieces of the pie and put it together, we can have a pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| Well, it's funny you would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| It would be interesting if an attorney, which I am not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| if an attorney could take a look at ways that we could get around HIPAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| Captain Jones, you said something that really struck me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| We all know who the frequent flyers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| It seems to me that if we could put together a list and we could identify those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| we might actually be able to do some intensive intervention with that group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| and really make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| I don't know how you get around the law on the identification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| but I sure would love to see that list and see if we couldn't do something just really targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| We've got 50 people in this community who are desperately in need of our care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| and as a community, surely we can come up with the resources to take care of 50 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| Dr. Noy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| That list was put together several years ago and was reported in the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| and John Gill from the DA's office had followed up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| The number of frequent flyers and a follow-up of a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| and those who went into permanent housing or permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| the arrest and emergency room visits and so forth dropped or were almost nonexistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| So that data is out there, and it's reported in a couple of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| Will that still be available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| Let me get Ms. Vivian first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| I think that that one statement is key to the safety center or whatever you're going to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| Those 217 people that were not helped because in their mind they didn't need the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| If we don't find a way to help that group, if we don't find that list and use that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| and then find a way to help those people, that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| That's what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| Those that keep on, and I don't like that term, frequent flyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| I'm going to tell you that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| I know that may be what it is, but I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| We have got to find a way when we set this center up that that's the group, that's the core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| You know, that's why we keep having to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| That's why you keep seeing them all and say, yeah, you know, you know them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| because you can't help them because they don't know they need the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| And the stuff that they're doing, this diversion center, they did, this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| You know what that was to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| That's when we walked out of that room and nobody did anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| and this group together got together and kept doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| Because we've been doing this for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| This has been happening for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| So what I'm saying to you is, you know, I know we've got laws we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| I know there's family you've got to convince, family they need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| But that group, you want to start somewhere, find that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| Let's start with that 217 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| And then we're doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| Well, I think the list will certainly help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| but I would like to commend the KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| and I'm sure the Knox County Sheriff's Office is doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| They are continuing, as he mentioned a while ago, they see these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| they know them by first names, and every time they see them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| it's just like trying to change somebody or convert them to a religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| You've got to keep pounding away at them before they get the message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| Not when it's to do with mental illness, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| There's got to be enough pounding at them that keeps saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| you're sick, you need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| Well, pounding may not be a good word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Encouraging them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| But they have to be reminded continuously, this I've got to do, this I've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| Yes, Ms. Martha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| So the question that came up for me, I've heard HIPAA thrown around a lot today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| and I'm a little confused about what the big hangup is with HIPAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| We share information for lots of different reasons in the name of continuity of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| in the medical community, in the interest of the patient all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| not for purposes that are not in the interest of the patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| but I think there are ways around that to be able to share that information more freely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| by putting some basic agreements in place and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| So, I mean, I think it's worth looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| When HIPAA first came out, it hamstringed us being able to do a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| but we've learned a lot about HIPAA and learned how to use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| and it's not our Achilles' heel anymore in the medical field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| And I don't think it has to be in this, but I'd be willing to help look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| Well, I think that probably if this thing is set up right, with a doctor intake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3110)|
| 0:52:01| you have a medical record started that can follow this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| through whatever particular avenue of treatment that they're presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| I don't see that as a violation of HIPAA if their records follow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| from one treatment center to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| Yeah, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| But, anyway, it's something I'd be willing to try to help address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| I think we've got enough bloggers we can work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Matt has one, then I'll get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Can I have one more? Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| And you've talked about having an MD intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Has there been any discussion about having a mid-level intake, nurse practitioner, PA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Not a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| That would be our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Okay, because you say MD, that's a different price tag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| a different level of commitment than a nurse practitioner or a PA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| I was just going to say that with the HIPAA requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| one tool that may be available for that is NOCS HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| It's a shared database system that a lot of the homeless service providers use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| and is HIPAA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| So there may be some way to use that as a tool for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Chairman, one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| I kind of opened this can of worms, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| One thing I do hope that we'll be able to do is focus ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| very deliberately on the safety center, as we've all acknowledged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| The safety center is one piece of the puzzle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| and we all want to address a whole bunch of the rest of the pieces of the puzzle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| but it would be a shame if we allowed ourselves to get so far off that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| in trying to deal with the larger issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| that we missed the opportunity to get the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| So I apologize to the group for opening, getting us into a broader discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| but I do hope that we can stay focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| because I don't want to miss this opportunity to get the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Well, I don't think you're wrong at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| I mean, the end game of this is going to have to come after the house is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| I think we all realize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| and I don't think we can stress enough the fact that we don't want to quit when the house is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| We need to keep pushing that end game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| just like KPD and the Sheriff's Department keep pushing, talking to these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| They say, have you been yet? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Here's your card again. You need to go again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Here, they'll help you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| Sometimes, somewhere along the way, it may take 20 times for this one individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| but it should click somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| I wanted to just applaud Captain Jones's efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| and what he's actually been able to produce here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| I know for a fact that he and his officers have dropped people off at Helen Ross McNabb's doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| at Cherokee's doors, and said, hey, can you help this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| And I really want to applaud those efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| because I think that kind of grassroots ask with other locations really helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| However, something that concerns me is looking at from October 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| and the change that's happened now, April 2016, is just housing availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| I think that is a huge game changer with how you might house somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| and I'm afraid that those 32 people, had this program started today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| wouldn't necessarily have not just housing availability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| but appropriate housing for these types of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| And so as we develop the RFP and develop those types of caveats and bullet points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| and things like that, it might be a good idea to look at bringing HUD to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| bringing Section 8, KCDC, some public housing authority, something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| to look at other options that we might be able to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| Well, that's true, and Bruce with Volunteer Ministries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| you're pretty much into permanent support even now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| So we've got the short-term and the long-term folks at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| but again, we've got to all plug in in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| Any other comments in regards to Mr. Black's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| or Captain Jones' on the KCDP program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3386)|
| 0:56:38| When Andy showed me this, I said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| I think that definitely would be one arm of the program that we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| You know, you can't always wait for people to come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| They're going out and hitting the people where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| and I think that's important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| Anything else on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| If not, we'll move on to, and I don't think this one will take very long at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| because I think it was published this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| Mr. Randy, do you have anything regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| I am advised by Mayor Burchett's office that he's been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| There will be no state participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Say what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| There will be no state participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| You're serious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| He lied to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| I quote that the administration felt that this program had no statewide applicability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3455)|
| 0:57:48| and that they have no money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| So that's what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| We tried to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| The mayor tells me that he's had a couple of conversations with the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3477)|
| 0:58:06| and I talked just yesterday with Senator Becky Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| Apparently they're going to adjourn as early as tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| So we'll have to do this otherwise, is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| If they're not going to do this, they better open back up Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| That's disturbing news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| Some of you may know of some grants that might be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| that we could apply for something like this in the health field somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3516)|
| 0:58:43| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| We're working now on a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| Ms. McNeil is trying to put together some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| It would be $250,000 a year for a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| She says that the grant is aimed almost precisely at this population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| that we're trying to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| I guess I'm not very good at guessing what's going to happen apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| so I hope that the grant is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| We'll be in position to have it filed timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| That's due a week from Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| Don, what group did your grant come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| SAMHSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| SAMHSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| It's a federal grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| What's the group in town that is kind of like overseer of the grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| Who is that group here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| On these types of things, it would be SAMHSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| It would be the main one that would deal with this type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| They're very, very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| I think we better start now looking to try to scrape some bucks together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| I mean, we can't run this thing on a shoestring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| Or any other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Where's the money from the city and the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| We can't wait on the state to do what we need to do for our own people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| How do we get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| We're spending all kinds of money everywhere all around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| All kinds of money is being spent in this city and this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| So where do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| We need some of the millions that we're spending on these parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| and all these trails and all this stuff that we're doing to make the city great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| We're right back to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| We take care of our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| So come on, city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Where's the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| How much does it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| What do we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| We need a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Are we sure enough got it in the rainy day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| We got it in the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| You got millions in the rainy day funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Well, I think that's a discussion that we're going to have to have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| with the mayors and the commission and city council to kind of see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| I mean, this is, to me, this is the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| I just don't see any justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| We can have a big years festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| We can have all these parks and all these different activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| that we cannot take care of our own people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| We need to spend some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| We need to get in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| We need some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| We need a dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| We need this much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| The first thing we're going to need to find out through this RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| is what kind of money we're talking about to get us on the starting block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| Well, that's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| When we come back to this meeting, we need a dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| because we came before you to say I need some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| If we don't have much money, we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| And you can't tell me you don't have it because we got surplus money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| And it shouldn't have to be the DA's office and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| Because what this was, when I say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| this means when we left that meeting three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| and we didn't do anything, they did what they could do with what they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| Now, we're going to have to stand up and we're going to have to demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| you know, it's an election year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| If you don't want to take care of your own people, get out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| You know, we have got to take care of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| There's 200 people we know need help out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| You've got all these people at the table taking time from their day to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| and say, hey, we want to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Then the people that sit in here on these commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| and city county meetings, they need to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| So the next meeting, we need to have a bottom line number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| Go ahead and draw it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| And you've got to have faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Step in on faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| But you ain't got nothing to show them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| But here's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| This is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| And don't make it a little small safety center either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| This is what we need to help the people of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| This is the dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| And then we're going after the dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| And if they don't want to do it, then they need to go back to the regular job or step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| They're not going to help your own people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| I mean, that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Well, that's what we're working toward now, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| That's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| So I think we need a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| You've got all these experts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| They know how much money it takes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Give Andy some dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| Give him some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| This is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Boom, boom, boom, boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Bottom line, total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| This is what we need to open this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| I think it's a little more complicated than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Mr. Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Well, I know the county's already put money back for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| I don't know about the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| I ain't into their finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| But I know the county has made that commitment, and we put it away two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| I will note that this ain't the first time the state's lied to us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| They did it when they closed Lakeshore, so they were going to send money here to help the mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| That never came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| And here we are four years later, and we're still begging them for money, and they ain't came through yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| So if we're waiting on the state, it ain't ever going to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| I had a lot over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| I turned mine off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| You changed mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| You changed mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| To be fair, what Commissioner Ornby says is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| There's a sizable amount of money that the county commission has set back for the construction of whatever we call this entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3825)|
| 1:03:54| a million dollars to be precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| And there's been conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| I don't know there's been any agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| But there's ongoing conversation on the operational funding from both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3842)|
| 1:04:09| This is very disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| But this is not the end, in my estimation, even close to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| I think this is going to be ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| And like all the other times, we'll figure out a way to do it the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| So although I'm sad and disappointed about that, I'm going to take it as an effort to rejuvenate our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3869)|
| 1:04:42| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| They just spent $398,000 a year for three years, and they helped some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3885)|
| 1:04:52| Are we getting ready to spend $690,000 in the city for some event coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| Why can we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| We know what they did and got 52 people going that are back and their lives are moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| So we got a pretty good idea of how much kind of money we need, just a basic figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| I still say we put that thing together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| We say how much we need, and we put them on the carpet, city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| I know the county's been on it, but it's time for the city to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3915)|
| 1:05:23| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| I'm looking ahead here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Commissioner, I do have a comment, and I agree with Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| I mean, it is discouraging that the state of Tennessee has decided not to help fund this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| But I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| I guess I'm the glass half full guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| Some of us have only been working on this for now about four and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| and I guarantee you that we're not going to quit simply because the state decided they were not going to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3951)|
| 1:06:01| So I agree completely with what Vivian's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| but I think that there's enough positive energy around this for something positive to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3963)|
| 1:06:13| and I believe that, and I think the majority of people sitting up here today believe that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3973)|
| 1:06:22| Okay, so we're discouraged, but this doesn't mean that it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| What's the game plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| When we leave here, we need to have a game plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| Where are we going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| What is the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| So that when we come back to this meeting in May, this is the next thing we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| Do we need to go ahead and back the program that they've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| so that the people that are not getting help can go ahead and get some help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| Do we have to have the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| We need to start dreaming, and we need to put something on paper and make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| I don't have your fancy words, and I don't have your tactics, you already know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| but I want us to do what the—we've got to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| We've got to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| No, I'm not discouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| It makes me more determined than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| I've got no problem sitting in here every time the city and county commission meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| We have got the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Everybody you need is at this table, everybody, and we see it's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| So when I leave here, I want to know when we come back in May, what are we coming back for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| And when we come back in June, what are we coming back for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| When we come back in May, we're going to be ready to take—send our RFP to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| to be voted on, to send out, and then we will schedule our next meeting around whatever time it takes to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4052)|
| 1:07:40| well, not purchasing now, the—what do we call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Procurement department, to get that back and present it back to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| which I would assume hopefully would be June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| So in the meantime, we will start—you know, everybody is going to be looking at different avenues of funds, grants, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4074)|
| 1:08:05| But I think we've got enough right now to put the basic framework together for the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4085)|
| 1:08:13| and based on the money that we can raise, we start putting in windows and doors in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4093)|
| 1:08:22| and we can't put any more windows and doors in than we have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| That's right, you start where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| But we are going to start, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| We didn't come to this table waiting for the state to give us some magic money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| We are a city and a county, two different governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| We have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| It's time for us to take our money and take care of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| Well, we need to find out how much it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| The cost outlay is going to be your first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Then we can plug in what we feel like we need to do around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Is there anybody here for a public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| Did you sign up on the sheet, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Well, come ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| You've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| Give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| I'm Judy Barnett, 1312 Parkland, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| Your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Judy Barnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| Miss Barnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| I missed her like last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| So I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| I've been following for several years the efforts to address urgent care for folks suffering from disease of the brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| I'm the parent of a child who might have been diverted from the criminal justice system to the mental health system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| if systems had been in place, even like what the KPD has been doing for the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| The consequence of only using criminal justice, the criminal justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| is a disaster for those unfortunates who suffer from untreated mental illness and addictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4189)|
| 1:09:56| I fully support the efforts of this committee in addressing a serious need in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4196)|
| 1:10:04| and I just want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Anyone else want to speak under public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| And give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| I'm Stephanie Guthrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| I work with UnitedHealthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| I have maybe questions more than a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| I'm just trying to understand in the safety center how it differs from a CSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| When we talk about, it sounds like you guys are planning on constructing a physical building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4234)|
| 1:10:42| Or one that could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| My question is, I worked with Captain Jones on the KEDP project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| I'm very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Instead of trying to construct another new building to do services, we see that we've got in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| we've got Helen Ross McNabb, we've got Cherokee, we've got Peninsula, we've got Ridgeview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| Why aren't we instead working with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| They're very stretched thin, but we've seen with a little bit of funding the kind of stuff that they can accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| So rather than trying to construct a new building to have this new program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| why aren't we then essentially turning to those agencies and having them create programs like the KEDP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4277)|
| 1:11:27| that can still target that same audience, still try to be working with those members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| but working with the expertise that they already have in place, utilizing the resources we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| instead of creating something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| And again, my question about how this differs from a CSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| Well, first off, we're not necessarily looking to build a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| If something is available that can be used for this purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| I know for a fact that there are at least a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| The money should be spent on the programs, not the house that it sits in necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4318)|
| 1:12:07| Now, your first question was CSU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Crisis Stabilization Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| What's CSU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Crisis Stabilization Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Oh, I'm not familiar with that and how it operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| I would suggest that it's different in that to work with these 272 people that you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4341)|
| 1:12:31| and to work with existing resources is not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| And if you talk about working within the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| then we would have to go to Blue Cross Blue Shield, UnitedHealthcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| and the other 10 care insurers and ask them to step up to the plate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4369)|
| 1:12:57| to help us fund and serve these particular people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| And then also to increase by 8 to 10 beds the Crisis Stabilization Units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| here in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| And then while we're at it, why don't we also add some treatment beds for substance abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| or additional treatment dollars for outpatient substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| Sixty percent of the people who present with a mental health issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| also have a corresponding A&D issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| Sixty percent of the people who present with an A&D issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| also have a corresponding mental health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| We'd love to be able to work with these people with the existing resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| but I think you said that those resources are stretched pretty thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| So I don't know how you rearranged the deck chairs on this Titanic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| to allow for us to serve these additional difficult-to-treat people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| keeping in mind that the overall goal is to reduce the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| who are severely and persistently mentally ill in the Knox County Jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| That's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| And if I could kind of echo what Mr. Black is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| Stephanie, I appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| I think it's an important distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| And if I get any of this wrong, please throw something at me and correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| But I think a CSU is a step-up level of care from what this is trying to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| I think whatever we call the safety center, what the real focus is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| not only diversion but a full, comprehensive, community-based comprehensive program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| that's going to be able to provide not only diversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| but also mental health access to care and anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| For somebody that is needing a crisis stabilization unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| we see in Captain Jones's report there was one referral sent into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| But these folks, it wouldn't be an appropriate method to send these folks into a CSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| Rather, they would need to go into this location where they can find motivational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| and readiness skills to actually get out of whatever barriers that they've come to find themselves in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4514)|
| 1:15:22| that impede their ability to find housing, appropriate care, appropriate services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| and everything else that keeps them bogged down in the homeless sectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| and everything else that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| So I think that's the distinction that at least I make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| Does that answer all your questions, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| He didn't see my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| At least half of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Yes, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| If I could just kind of carry it on what they've already talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| the CSU would be a part of what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| It would be one of the resources that this center would have to be able to get people the help that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| But, you know, that's only one piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Then you have, you know, long-term care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Do they need long-term care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| We try to find that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| If they just need case management and counseling, then this is a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| You're looking to try to put a place at one place where people know I can go here and get help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| if I need the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| I'm not having to wait until I get into trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| and then I'm introduced to it through the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| I don't think that's the ideal way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| We just use that to address the need that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| because we saw it as an injustice that folks were getting introduced in the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| that were getting introduced because of their behavior that they didn't have any control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4606)|
| 1:16:53| But the CSU would be a part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| and it would be the way it was supposed to be set up in the 70s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| when the mental health hospitals closed down across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| Each community was supposed to set something up to deal with folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| that weren't severe enough to be housed for the rest of their lives in a mental health institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| but needed some kind of day-to-day or week-to-week, month-to-month care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| And that's what we're trying to develop here to be able to get people to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| And they're as comfortable walking in there on their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| or having a family member walk them in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| instead of waiting until it gets to the crisis level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| where law enforcement gets called in because the family's frustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| because they've got no place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| That is the real disappointing thing about this whole system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| is the families are caught in these traps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| and they deal with it day in, day out, week in, week out, year in, year out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| until they get so frustrated that their last hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| is to call the only person that answers the phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| and that's the police department, to come and deal with this problem for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| And then the police departments historically have been handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| We didn't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| But as you start looking into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| we've got to develop something that will give folks the hope they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| to think at least I can go here and try to get started in some direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| no matter where I'm at in my stage of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| whether I'm homeless or I have a $15 million home on the lake in Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| I've got someplace I can go to try to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| And it's a community-based thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| And just like everybody else up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| I wasn't really anticipating any money coming in from anywhere besides our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| Andy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| You're not stumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| I just want to point out we have another person who would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| She spoke earlier. You want to speak to something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| I didn't sign up, but may I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| It's a different person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| Well, they didn't either. They don't listen to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| You have five minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| As long as it's pertinent to our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| My name is Tina Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| I live at 612 Avenue A, Vestal, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| What's your first name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Tina, T-I-N-A, Sparks, 612 Avenue A, Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4760)|
| 1:19:27| I agree with a lot that's been said here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| and I want to say thank you to this man right here, Captain Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| for all that you are doing, that all you have done is what little you've had to do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| It's a very admirable thing that you have done, that your police officers have done and are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4781)|
| 1:19:48| I want to thank Ms. Vivian here for speaking her mind, as she always does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| But what I want to say is the people who we are talking about, sometimes they don't think straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4797)|
| 1:20:08| They can't think straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| Unless they have something concrete, something that they can understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| a place where they can go, whether it be whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| They're already spread out all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| I mean, their lives are pulled apart, and they cannot really comprehend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| well, I need to go here for this, then I need to catch the bus to go there for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| and then I've got to find some how to be able to, if I happen to have some kind of a low job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| to take off long enough to go stand in this line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| They can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Even if they're smart enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| My brother, he was a smart person, but he didn't have, I mean, he was smart in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4854)|
| 1:21:01| they're smart and then they're smart, you know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| And people who need the mentally ill, the friends who have the drug addictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4864)|
| 1:21:13| who have the alcoholism, the homelessness, the pressure from their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4873)|
| 1:21:21| they need direction, but it's not going to be like a pounding it into, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4881)|
| 1:21:30| you need to do this, you need to do this, you need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| They need direction, and they need to know that somebody really cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| I think that the police officers going back again and again and recognizing them on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4897)|
| 1:21:47| being able to say, well, why didn't you go here, I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| But I think being a family member, it is very frustrating to have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4912)|
| 1:22:02| well, you know, you have to do this, you have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| They can't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| They have to be able to trust and to be able to know that this is just another dead end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4927)|
| 1:22:21| or another story or another promise that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4941)|
| 1:22:28| And then it's too late for a lot of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4948)|
| 1:22:35| So the sooner, and forget about Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| This is not Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| This is Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| This is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| This is across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| It's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| So if he can do it with $398,000, well, then surely the combined efforts of all you people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4969)|
| 1:23:06| and the city has got to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| The city has got to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| But if he can do what he's done with $398,000, we've got to be able to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=4994)|
| 1:23:21| You all have got to be able to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| And if you can't do it, if you don't know how to do it, then you don't need to be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5003)|
| 1:23:31| Somebody else needs to be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| And I know all of you all are here because you care or you wouldn't be here in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| And I do appreciate everything that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| And when you got frustrated about, did you just, you just got that news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5023)|
| 1:23:51| You just heard from Nashville that there's not going to be any help from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| I could see that in your face, in your expression, that you were, and we're not giving up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5035)|
| 1:24:03| No, no, no, no, nobody's going to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| It's just we have to work harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| I'm sorry, but I just want to tell you that I really appreciate everything you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| Gentleman over here, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| Gentleman in the yellow shirt has his hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Well, you know, we're pushing time here for commission meeting coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| If you want to come quickly, I made an announcement in the beginning twice that you need to sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| if you want to speak on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| My name is John Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| I live at 1120 Kenyon Street in Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| I am an employee at Peninsula, their peer support program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5092)|
| 1:24:59| So I guess my question was, I'm really curious about why the state has decided that this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5099)|
| 1:25:06| could not be replicated because I don't understand why it can't be sort of a regional thing similar to CSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5106)|
| 1:25:15| There are CSU units in different regions of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| Why can't there be diversion programs regionally, and what would that involve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| I'm also curious what public awareness programs there are to get people aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| that most people may not know that this is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| And what kind of advocacy can we do to maybe put a little bit of pressure on Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| to honor that promise that was made when Lakeshore was closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| I think at this point there isn't really an answer because I think most of us up here are still in shock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5148)|
| 1:25:57| from what Randy gave us, that information earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| I know I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| But that doesn't mean we're going to quit, and I guarantee you these folks around this table are not going to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| To answer that question, I don't know what the state, we will try to find out what their reasons are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| And I can assure you that we won't quit asking, whatever it takes and how we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5175)|
| 1:26:24| We have to see where the rocks are in the river before we can try to cross them to get down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5184)|
| 1:26:33| Part of the benefit of this program is that it saves money long term by keeping people out of jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5193)|
| 1:26:41| Is that saving just local money, or is it also federal money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| It's federal state money too because if they have to go to Marcus and Ben or one of the other programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| they've got to be paid there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| But you asked about advocacy on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| The time to do that is when we get the RFP back and we say, okay, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5216)|
| 1:27:03| here's what we want to do and here's what it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| How much are you willing to chip in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Are we going to add another penny or two on the tax rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| Bad, you know, bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| That's like shooting yourself in the foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| We are in a budget surplus at the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| I'm sure that money could be answered for really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| We also have a giant service debt too, and we have to hold so much back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5242)|
| 1:27:30| But being a lame duck, if it takes another penny or two and everybody is interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| and they want this because they need to protect themselves and those they love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| then everybody is going to have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| That's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| I appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| Anything else anybody has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| You going to can me now, Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| We will set that once we get a little more information here from the state and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| Most likely it might be an executive meeting, but we'll get together on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Do we need to make a motion to ask the commission to issue the RFP in the May meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| Does that need to be a motion, or will you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| Yes, let's do that today, because we'll be ready to ask for something in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5298)|
| 1:28:25| I so move then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| Motion moved and seconded that we ask in May, with what we have at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| for the commission to ask for the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| I think we'll be ready in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160418SafetyMeeting?start=5323)|
