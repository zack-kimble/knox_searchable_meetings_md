| 0:02:02| that we may deal with those events that are unexpected and so desperately dramatic to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=122)|

| 0:03:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of our last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Any questions, corrections, additions, deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Meetings are passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Minutes are passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Before we move into items to deal with the agenda, those of you who are regulars here would note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| that we have a new person sitting up here up front with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Debbie Poplin is the new law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| And to make that official, we are going to swear her in tonight so that what she says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| and does can be officially represented for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| And to swear her in is Judge Tom Varlan, who is a federal judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| but prior to that was the city law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| and was the city law director when Debbie was hired in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| So it's particularly appropriate that he be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| So I'm going to ask Judge Varlan to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Debbie's family is here as well, her children and husband, her parents and in-laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| And so I think some of them are going to come up and help hold the Bible for Debbie to be sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| and we'll walk right around here and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| You only want to do that one time because when Mama finds out that her kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| in handcuffs, pitched in the back of a car illegally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| they're probably going to find him an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Anybody guess who that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| I wouldn't want to call anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Not him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| But there will be an attorney that will fight this case free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| So that's what you're up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| You have to make sure when you're dealing with juveniles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| that we know that they did something that was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| I had one yesterday over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| One of our officers, our chief officer, brought one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| He went in, got a call from the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| The boy wouldn't take the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| He goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| He can tell the boy he's been smoking marijuana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| He had no marijuana on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| He charges him with disorderly conduct in his own house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| You can't be disordered in your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| You can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Disorderly conduct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| What's it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| In a public court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| In the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| That I possess all of the qualifications required by the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| and ordinance of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| or by general law of the office that I'm about to assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| that I will discharge my duties as city law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| faithfully, honestly, and impartially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| So help me God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| We should do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=361)|
| 0:06:17| Thank you, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| While Debbie's walking back to her seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| I also want to recognize several members of our law department are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| We have a wonderful law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| You just watched history being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| Debbie is the very first female law director in the history of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| But when that point was made when we announced her selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| a lot of people said, well, is that why you hired her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| And to be honest with you, it has nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Well, it has a little to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| It's always nice to be able to break barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| But it has a lot more to do with the fact that Debbie is an outstanding attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| who really cares about the city of Knoxville and does terrific work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| So to her family, I thank you for sharing her with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| She does great work for the city and its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| And you should all be very proud of your daughter and daughter-in-law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| and wife and mother because she's done great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| And we're very glad to have her here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Thanks, Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Thanks, Laura.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| They can't convict a juvenile on their own statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| Now, in an adult court, if some guy we interviewed said he did it, we can convict him, can't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| A juvenile's statement cannot be used against a juvenile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| 6A is in application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Actually, we need to deal with items of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| That's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Any items to deal with the agenda tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| Any items to be withdrawn first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| We move to withdraw item 11L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| Is it Larry, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| That's the one concerning 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Moving to withdraw 11L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=466)|

| 0:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| All those in favor of withdrawing 11L, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=471)|

| 0:08:01| Mr. Frost again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| First is item 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| That's the senior citizen's tax freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| We have a workshop coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| So I was going to propose to move that for four weeks, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| 12F postponed for four weeks and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=495)|

| 0:08:22| I'm going to go to Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| I was wondering on the 11N, was there anyone here from the trustee's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| What do you think this officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| I don't think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| I haven't seen anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=511)|

| 0:09:03| I'd like to postpone 12G until April 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| This is the new location for the recycling center in Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| The city could not find a better location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| We're going to give the neighborhood a chance to see if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=557)|

| 0:09:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| I presume I noticed the postponement notice there beside item number 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| So I assumed it had been requested again by the applicant, but I did not hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| I move that we postpone item number 9A, and we will say two weeks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| 9A postponed for two weeks and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| Any discussion on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=589)|

| 0:09:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=595)|

| 0:10:04| asked for a postponement for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| But first I wanted to ask if there was anyone here that came for this item number before we consider postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| This is Washington Pike, southwest of Mill Road, 12BB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| Is there anybody here for that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| Are you all here in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Are you all the property owner, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| I'm not sure what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Can you come to the podium, please, real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| And we'll let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| But we have had two of them already in jail or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| One of them just got caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Mr. King said you all are the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| I am the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| So there's no objection to postponing for four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| Of course not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Why do we want to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| To advise them of their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| You might want to ask your attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| And then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| I don't have an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| I got contacted by some of the property owners in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| The request is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| If, as the applicant said, there's no objection to postponing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| I would suggest you just go forward and talk to them back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| If we can come to some agreement, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| If not, I'll make my request to postpone when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| So you all, we'll leave it on the agenda for now and you all can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| Is that okay with counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=680)|

| 0:12:56| of the city recorder's office, Ms. Susan Wilson, who is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=776)|

| 0:16:02| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Yeah, I'll try and be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| This is, as we all know, actually deals with the plan to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| And it's always something I'm very concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| You know, struggle a lot with our efforts to end chronic homelessness in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| I actually went and got the tapes from the workshop council meeting we had on the Fifth Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| and listened to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| We're brilliant, you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| We really are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| And I was impressed at listening to that of how far we've come since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| This was less than two years ago, how much has been accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Still a few weaknesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| I mean, the challenge with this one is siting another location in a poor neighborhood, but we're doing good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| We're spreading things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| I feel like we're taking some significant steps also in getting the support services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| which was talked a lot about with the Fifth Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| making sure we have the, you know, not just the buildings for people, but the support services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| And I know we're taking some steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| The other thing that was talked a lot about that I just want to say a word on with the Fifth Avenue is leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| And the plan calls for significant leadership, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| bringing us together forward to deal with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| I think we've done a great job with hiring John Lawler to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Actually, one of the things that was said at this meeting with the Fifth Avenue was asking the mayor to do a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| of leading this council in dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| I just want to publicly remind us that I think we need more opportunities to deal with this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| to step up on it, and wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| I know we talked to you privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| We wanted to say that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| So, when you call us, people can be mad at me instead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| I think it's a great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| I mean, I think it's a shame on us if the only time it comes before you is if a location is up at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| So, it is a big issue for us involving lots of resources, but also hopefully lots of solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| So, well said, and we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1073)|

| 0:20:46| If the automobiles are serviceable, then why do we just lease them for a dollar a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1246)|

| 0:21:16| making them more available for more calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1276)|

| 0:22:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| 11J is a resolution urging the Kroger Corporation to refund towing fees to persons whose vehicles were towed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| from the Kroger lot located at Clinton Highway and Merchants Drive while the vehicle owners were voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| at Norwood Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Requested by Councilmembers Frost, Hall, and Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| We do have someone signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| I know Mr. Clark Hamilton is here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| I just wanted to say I, you know, spoke with both folks from Kroger's and the towing company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| The Kroger people were very generous and very apologetic for what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| You know, as I think I've said before publicly, the real tragedy were the number of people who saw the cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| that were getting towed as they pulled in the parking lot and turned, never getting to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1412)|
| 0:23:40| You know, this is definitely an unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| I checked the day after this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Actually, I checked with the city law department to see if this particular towing company does have a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| with the city, and it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| And much to my dismay, I come to find out on February 28th there's a wrecker commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| where this very same company is being called in on the carpet about what's been alleged is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| that they've been illegally running wrecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| So, you know, hopefully there's miscommunication there and that really didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| But, you know, like I said, the real shame are the folks that didn't get to talk or, excuse me, didn't get to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| I spoke with someone who said a tow truck driver was very confrontational to a voter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| got right up in their face and, you know, told them to back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| And this is while someone was trying to go in to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| That's all I really have to say and let Mr. Hamilton, who's the precinct chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| Clark, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| I'm Clark Hamilton, 1200 Stillwell Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| I've worked the 41st Precinct Norwood Library for 38 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| I've been the officer of the election the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| And at Norwood Library, we have a very limited amount of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| We have approximately 24 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| I have six workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| When our cars occupy that space, we get down to about 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Between 3.30 and 7.30 in the afternoon, when the vast majority of people are getting off from work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| we have a large abundance of overflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| And historically, we've always parked in the Kroger parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| particularly when the Kroger facility was operating there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| And this is the first time we've had an issue come up to where our cars were told off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| There are two signs listed there, but they're extremely small signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| I wouldn't address the size of the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| The other thing is I'm asking city council to work with Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| On the election days, if we could have a pass so our voters can park there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| because that's the additional parking that we're going to have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| And the up-and-coming election in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| and the up-and-coming election in November is going to be quite heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| This was a record performance as far as voters turning out in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| We anticipate the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| And at various and sundry times, we may have as many as 15 or 20 cars over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| because many times I have as many as 30 or 40 people in line waiting to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| And when they're in line to vote and they say your car's been towed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| and they bail out and when you have a voter application in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| and you're in line to vote and someone's car's been towed out, they bail out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| Then it makes my job a very difficult one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| I've got to go retrieve those documents and I've got to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| and back that thing out in the voting machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| So it was an extremely situation that was just very perplexing to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| as the operators of the election there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| The confrontational aspect by the record drivers is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| They was very unforgiving, very unsympathetic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| and it was a situation I had to call the officers to stand that situation down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| It almost got out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Thank you, Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Any other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| 11K is a resolution requesting and encouraging the legislature of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| to repeal legislation which authorizes Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| to take as a fee a sum up to one percent of sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| for transmitting these funds to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Questions or comments here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| This is probably directed, I guess, at Councilman Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| because I know you're one of the authors of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| I think it's an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Based on the article in the newspaper, I think we would assume that the request would be to find some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| to meet constitutional muster this time so that we're not faced with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| the same kind of situation where it's not a private act, essentially, and could be repealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| Actually, there are two different resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| I mean, they're both very similar in nature, so it might be easy to get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| The one that Councilmember Bailey and I proposed was to address the situation on a local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| with approaching the trustee's office directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| and that was the one that withdrew at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| This one was proposed by Vice Mayor Brown, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| That's quite all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| I'll take credit when I can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| I'll direct my question to the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| Yeah, and the whole purpose is, as Councilman Frost just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| is I think it's very important that this goes to the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| You know, one of the options here is that maybe they look at repealing it altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| and to me, it's a very simple question that should be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| You know, the city has the capacity, has the talent, has the ability to deal with these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| and have them provided directly to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| And that's the question that I think I'm going to ask the mayor to have Tony Thompson, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| take a look at and see if we can get the legislature to change it so the money gets paid to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| It makes no sense to me that that money comes into the same building that we are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| Sometimes I don't know if it's on the same floor, but at least in the same building that we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| it's costing taxpayers $30,000 a month, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| for that to happen when they could transmit it directly to the city finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| So I think that we should look at it from that vantage point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| And then we can turn around and if we want to use those dollars to help the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| or to help other citizens in the city, we should be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| So that's the whole purpose for us to take it to the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| and have them either modify or repeal it so that hopefully those dollars can come directly to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| because I'm just at a loss and don't quite understand why it makes sense to send it over to the county trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| and not directly to us, you know, to the city finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| I just was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| I noticed it was prepared by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| And I presume our names will all be on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| And let me also say, Mr. Mayor, very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| and I read the article today and I thought it was an informative article, historically informative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| but this is not an opportunity to pick another squabble with county commission or the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| This is an opportunity to hopefully show some efficiency in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| I'm sure someone out there is going, wait a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| there's a check coming over wire to the trustee's office in the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| and then $30,000 has been peeled off that for them to then pass it to the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| which is in the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| To me, that kind of shows some inefficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| And it's not county commission's fault or the trustee's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| That's just an antiquated system that now that we are in a position to be able to deal with those monies directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| that maybe we should just come into the 21st century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| and bring those dollars directly to the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| And I'm speaking as a vice mayor, as Mark Brown, and not for the mayor or any other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| So that's just my position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| It costs about $30,000 to $40,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1846)|
| 0:30:46| Mayor, I just wanted to add that I think you've had a little history in discussing this with the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| and we really never got anywhere with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| So I think both of these resolutions are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Let me ask this, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| You just said you thought both were appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| One has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1867)|

| 0:31:11| No, I understand there's a little work going on into where these funds that go to the trustee's office go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| and I think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| So let's just see how that works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| You know, they're directed to a certain place, and we just need to figure out where they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| and then we can figure out where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1891)|

| 0:31:38| I was meeting with the other four or the mayors of the other four large cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| and, of course, Nashville is combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| They have metro government that I think the same degree of frustration exists in Chattanooga and Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| 11M is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a first amendment to the City of Knoxville's lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1910)|

| 0:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| I'm glad that the city and the partnership have been able to work out this lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| to bring another educational opportunity into not only the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| but into the downtown and into the Super 6 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| And if this all works out, we welcome LMU here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| and look forward to you providing a great educational opportunity for all the citizens of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| especially putting something in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| I think this just could be a really good win-win for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| I just want to congratulate everyone who's been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| I know that this didn't happen overnight and have some sense of the negotiations that have been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| And, you know, every time my route into town is my little pig path is Middlebrook Pike to Western| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| and then so I come into the city there and I look at that beautiful building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| and it's just with tremendous regret that it's been vacant since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| And I'm just particularly excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| My family has a little bit of history with Lincoln Memorial University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| and my dad absolutely loved the institution because his good friend Hop Bailey was so involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| and then my brother has been quite involved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| And I'm just extremely excited because I just think it's a natural for Lincoln Memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| So I'm excited that Lincoln Memorial has considered bringing a campus into Knoxville in such a prime location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2003)|
| 0:33:32| And I just want to thank everyone who's worked on it because I just cannot wait to get back in that building again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| It's really just an incredible building, extraordinary building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| And I'm convinced that you will maintain its historic significance for us to enjoy for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| I appreciate Councilman Pelo's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| And it's good to know that there's somewhere in the city we can still go to find pig paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| I've been to all of ours in south Knoxville and covered them up with roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Now I know where to go look for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| That's why I appreciate my little pig paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| Looking forward, I see Mr. Debusque is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I'd like to hear what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Now we picked today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Today's a special day to bring up L.A.M.U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| I mean, I believe it's Lincoln's birthday, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Hey, Pete, could you give us your name and address first just for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| My name is Pete Debusque, 2536 Cunningham Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| Of course, I'm chairman of the board of L.A.M.U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| And for some time we've been trying to move forward at L.A.M.U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| Our mission is the Appalachians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| And this is the Appalachians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| And 100 years ago we had a medical school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| Well, we've restored it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| We now have another medical school, a big medical school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| And we had a law school 100 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| And so certainly Lincoln was a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| That's our mission, is to take and restore some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| So I look at the old city hall building and, I mean, there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| It's very southern looking, very historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| Something real good needs to preside there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Something that would certainly make Knoxville proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| And something else that the economical impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| We did an economical impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| I'm going to leave this for you, Mayor, on what effect the medical school will have on the region around Harrogate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2123)|
| 0:35:35| And you'd be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| I mean, you can have a good industry, but you better have a big industry if it's going to be equal to a pretty good sized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| And the other thing, yes, medical school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| but the other thing we're looking at going down the road is a doctoral in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| If you would check, you'll find that a great deal of the teachers in Knox County, in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| got their EDS at LMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| So to take that program and move it up another level for the EDD, we're looking at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| So it's strategic for us, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| It's strategic for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| And we think we get good synergies in teaming up if we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| Other questions for Mr. DeBusque?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Let me just go ahead, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| I also wanted to, you know, I say this tongue-in-cheek, but also I say this in recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| Thank Bill Owen for his hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| I'm glad we've got to this point because I need a break from the phone calls and e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| And so I'm glad that we got a positive resolution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| We appreciate your involvement, your civic involvement in bringing LMU here to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| I'll say Mr. Buss came to me with this idea a year and a half ago, and there were a lot of hurdles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| He had a complicated lease involving that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| There were some costs involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| And every time, I remember thinking, okay, Pete, that's great if you can pull it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| and thinking it might be a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| But he kept knocking down those barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| And we're excited about having that use and the folks you'll bring downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| and the additional education you'll bring to the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| We might just say thank you very, very much to the council for bringing this to the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| We were supposed to be on the agenda, and it got bumped off, and we finally had a conference call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| And I want to say a special thank you to your new law director who pushed this thing through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| Well, actually, without all of you and without mentioning everybody's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| I want to thank each and every one of you for allowing this to go on the agenda and for your assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2260)|
| 0:37:47| We do think it is a win-win situation for everybody involved, TVA, Old City Hall Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| City of Knoxville, and Lincoln Memorial University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2276)|

| 0:41:20| Next on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| When this came before MPC, it was sort of initiated based on a requested rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2481)|
| 0:41:30| in the Fort Sanders neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| And I have some real concerns about it in that the way it's set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| it ostensibly offers greater control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| but it also opens up C-1 to uses that are essentially all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| That may or may not be a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| I expressed my concern at the MPC meeting about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2513)|
| 0:42:01| You look at what's allowed, the allowed uses under use on review under C-1 now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2521)|
| 0:42:09| as far as commercial uses, you have, like, laundry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| and that could be as little as a couple of coin-operated machines and a closet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| so the rest could be all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| And I guess my concern is do we really want to go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with the way this has been handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| I'm not being critical of the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| I think they responded to a request for a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| Again, my preference would be to further review this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2558)|
| 0:42:48| to ask MPC to take another look at it to see if there's a better way to deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| because the idea with C-1 is to allow for mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| And I think, I know I and I think many of our council members believe that mixed use is something very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2579)|
| 0:43:08| to encourage in the appropriate circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| But I'm a little concerned about why we might end up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| how we might end up using a commercial zone to allow for, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| a higher density residential in a particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| where ostensibly it was going to be a neighborhood commercial application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| and in fact we could end up with essentially no commercial at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| So I, my preference would be to send this back to MPC for further review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2615)|
| 0:43:46| to take another look at it and see if there's another way of addressing these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Councilman Peo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Well, I was just going to ask Mr. Donaldson if he would like to make a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| We were, in fact, responding to a very specific zoning case in order to find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| to accommodate a development that the neighborhood supported at the time of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| By moving the dwelling units from a permitted use to a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| it exposes any development to site plan approval by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| and makes it available for appeal to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| It requires a public hearing that's noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| and it puts in place controls that aren't available as a use by right, especially for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2672)|
| 0:44:43| If someone wanted to develop a residential property on a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| that might be appropriate for neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| it would be more than likely that they would rezone it to some sort of residential zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| and have the coin-operated laundry as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| But we feel that the use on review provides appropriate controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| and exposes any possible development to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| The situations that a neighborhood commercial zone district can be used vary greatly from a very urban setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2713)|
| 0:45:22| such as Fort Sanders to a more suburban setting out on the perimeter of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| So the potential uses of dwellings in association with another use are going to vary greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2727)|
| 0:45:37| So the use on review allows that sort of flexibility within the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Now, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| I was just wondering, when I was reading the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| I was reading that MPC is actually saying it's no longer going to be a use as a matter of right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2749)|
| 0:45:57| that it would be a use, that it was going to have to go through the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| You know, this council in the past year lost the opportunity to have certain things heard at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| reviewed by city council, and I deeply regret that, as I'm sure everyone else on council does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| Here's another opportunity for the public to have input on a piece of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2776)|
| 0:46:26| and the use of a property that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| So I guess I'm going to respectfully disagree with my friend Joe Holquist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| because, you know, I enjoy the public aspect of land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| I guess I agree with Mr. Frost on some level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| and with Mr. Donaldson that if people zone property as commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| and want to use it as residential, well, frankly, it's only good for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| because they're actually paying a slightly higher tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| And I guess I just want to ask Councilman Holquist, having I know you spoke at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| whether you've got some ideas on language that would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| and to ask Mr. Swanson if these are things we can just add here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| Well, I appreciate that, and I apologize for not articulating that better than when I first spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| I suspect Mr. Swanson's answer would be if it's very substantive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| then we'd have to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Mr. Donaldson's comments reminded me of something that I neglected to mention initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| and that he and I had discussed this prior to the MPC meeting when this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| And as he alluded to, this is there are really sort of two very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| neighborhood commercial patterns that come under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| One is a suburban type development and the other is a much more urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| What triggered this was Fort Sanders neighborhood, which is very urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| And what was originally proposed in the neighborhood signed off on was not what was taken to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2873)|
| 0:48:02| And folks from the neighborhood association felt like they had essentially not been fully apprised of what was going to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2882)|
| 0:48:14| And they felt like they had been told one thing and then something else had been taken to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| But what Mr. Donaldson and I had talked about is perhaps the need at some point of establishing two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2900)|
| 0:48:29| neighborhood commercial zones, one more suburban and one urban with different characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| And I would be more comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| If we approve this on an interim basis, I could certainly live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| And my point is not to just try to be difficult or to fight this, you know, just on the sake of principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| but rather to try to get us where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| And I would be okay with approving this on an interim basis as long as we understand that we're going to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| and look at perhaps splitting out the suburban and the urban neighborhood commercials zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| and designate it separately with separate guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| I guess we did a resolution to MPC a little while ago asking them to review all the commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| And I assume that would be something that they would come under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| But specifically with the language of this, did you have language that you'd like to see different in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| I do not have language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| My belief is that it would be too substantial and too dramatic a change to be something that we could deal with tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| And it would take some more time and effort working with MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| So, no, the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| No, there was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| He just he did not make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=2989)|

| 0:51:29| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Yeah, brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| I'm a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| When we do, and I'm thinking especially some of the South Knox developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| we're saying we're going to approve something at this density, going to have some open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| I'm always concerned about increasing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| And looking at this one, my understanding, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| this was actually something that was done back in the early 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| so it's been a very long time, a lot of changes out there since the original 12 units per acre were set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| So I guess I don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| I'm just always a little concerned about coming back and increasing density down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| In this specific situation, and Mr. Bedwell is here, so perhaps he would rather speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| but this has been very carefully considered by the West Hills Association and who drew up the West Hills plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| and this property is within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Robert, if you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Robert Bedwell, 1321 Harvey Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| In answer to the question, this has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Gallery View is now a five-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| This is the last phase on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| It's only two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| We have agreements with the homeowners that we're staying outside vegetation buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| and that really created a little more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| Ms. Peeler, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Well, I just wanted to comment that I think one of the aspects of the development, as it's planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| is that it will not open onto Broom Road and the access or, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| it won't open onto Gallagher or Broom, and so the access will be through the development, correct, Mr. Bedwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| You're right on Broom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Gallagher View is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| That's an emergency exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Well, it's also subject to life safety of the city engineering and MPC requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| and we have postponed our hearing Thursday to do a traffic study at the request of both those departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| and then it will be up to them to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| We are in agreement not to have access, but we are bound by what they require us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| I didn't state that quite correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| But Broom Road, that is, Broom Road will not be accessed, and that's what we traded away earlier on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| And the developers have not asked to access or exit out of North Gallagher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| and that was something that the community was very interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| However, as Mr. Bedwell states, there are some regulations that have to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3238)|

| 0:54:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| I know the applicant and despite that I'll probably vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| What I was wondering, though, I was asking Mr. Swanson, this is only being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| he's applying for outside flower sales, but this zone will allow much more than outside flower sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| If there was something that the 2nd District representative wanted to do to potentially address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| Well, I called yesterday to get a little information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| We have had that come up in a number of locations actually in 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| And it doesn't appear that's going to be an enormous problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| Several of our churches like to sell pumpkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| It's that kind of seasonal sale that they have requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3341)|
| 0:55:49| I have had no objection to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| And so I'm just having to go along with the request because I have no reason to raise an objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3352)|
| 0:56:00| or to even dream that there will be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| Mr. McElroy is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| I don't know if he'd like to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Oh, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| I don't know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| He is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| Would anybody like to ask the applicant anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Well, do comment on the type of sales that you are anticipating or hoping to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| I'm Drew McElroy, 815 Ethan's Linn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| I was just approached by the tenant in that building about increasing the traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| This is the adopt-a-pet center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| And I guess, Councilman Frost, any concerns you might have or kiboshed by the fact that it's a quarter of an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| any way you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| There's not going to be much going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| I'm not putting in a chemical factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| But they just thought that you could have Christmas trees, pumpkins, flowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| and anything to increase the foot traffic to increase their pet adoptions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| And I thought I could accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Well, my only concern was the lot is a bit small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| And I was able to pull out on Kingston Pike there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| And it was a very tragic accident a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| And when I called to inquire, I believe I talked to Mr. Pruitt, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| And that was my thinking is, you know, that is not an area where we can have a lot of folks wanting to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3433)|
| 0:57:21| and pull into the turn lane there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| And that was my major concern was the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| And Mr. Pruitt was my major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| Well, he explained to me the rationale behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| And as I said, I've had no objections to give me any reason to oppose what they are wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| I wasn't, let me clarify, I wasn't suggesting opposing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| The sale of flowers isn't the issue and support that wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| It's just that when in 20 or 30 years that property will have the zoning that permits, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| everything that's allowed in C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| Well, basically, that property has had a number of names and faces over the years that I'm very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3479)|
| 0:58:07| So I wouldn't be surprised if it had a different flavor at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| Mr. Frost, if it makes you feel any better, I spent a substantial amount of money removing the underground storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| tanks there when I bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| So it's cleaner now than it was when I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| It was a service station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Dental office, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| I concur with Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| I just didn't know whether there was any wisdom in making this zoning conditional going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| so that, you know, 20 years from now we don't end up with something there with outdoor display| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| and sales that's not flowers and pumpkins but something more egregious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| And we want to consider modifying this zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I mean, I could certainly support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| You know, something that would, I guess we could limit it to just, you know, four times a year flower sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| I don't know the legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| But my interest thing is one of the, if you recall, the request we made to MPC to look at commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| actually started with the C4 zone sort of in a very similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| I would be inclined to, you know, make sure that Mr. Donaldson is paying attention as I'm sure he always is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| and is getting sort of the sense of counsel of what we're hoping to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| and look at potentially a change in some of the C4 regulations down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| to prevent the kind of things that we're all worried about on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| Mr. Swanson has reminded me that if we did want to make this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| if there was support for thinking about conditions that this would have to go back to MPC to impose those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| You know, I was just floating a trial balloon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| As I've said many times before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| I see it as the responsibility of the district specific representative to ride herd, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| and gather all the facts and marshal them and put forth a sound basis when a rezoning comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3601)|
| 1:00:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| An ordinance approving the request of Murphy Development LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| for a one-year plan amendment from low-density residential to general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| for parcels 36, 37, and 38 only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| Property located on the northeast side of Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| northwest of John May Drive, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| I think there might be a mistake in the ordinance where it says in the first line here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| Samuel J. Furrow applied for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| Does Mr. Furrow have anything to do with this development, Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| Shouldn't that be your name there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| John Murphy, 6514 Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| There is also something else I want to bring up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| I don't know if it needs to have C3 in front of that commercial district or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| but the other ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Those are two areas in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| So, no, Mr. Furrow does not have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| So do I need to amend this to put John A. Murphy in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| Why don't we do that just to be certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Couldn't we blame Sam if people don't like it, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| Would you like to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| I'll make the motion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| There's a motion to amend to substitute Mr. Murphy's name for Mr. Furrow's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| We're just voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| I see some lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Raise your hand if you want to discuss just the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Now we're back to the motion as amended, and I see several lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Steve, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| There was a meeting with the laws of concern property owners there that Mr. Murphy attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| and Councilman Becker and I attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| And it was pretty unanimous, I think, at the meeting that they were all in favor of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| I'll go to Mr. Bailey, and then I'll come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| I just wanted to say I just want to applaud the developer and working with the adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| This has had a lot of work, and I was involved there from the beginning, and I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| why we've come to this unanimous conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| What I think you were discussing concerning the rezoning of the property, you're one agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| item ahead of yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| That's the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| That'll come next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| There is a Mr. Charles Roach who signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| There's no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| If you'll come down and give us your name and address and just say that, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=3772)|

| 1:08:59| Basically, I'm a Fountain City resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| I bought a home on Dogwood Road over 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| It is on the Dogwood Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| I was very passionate about the Dogwood Trail and spent thousands of dollars a year decorating my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| Those that know the Fountain City Dogwood Trail know my home because I had the knight in shining armor that I would decorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| Approximately six years ago, I bought a house on Tazewell Pike to run my office out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| It has three employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| We're executive recruiters that don't do business in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| For approximately six years, I asked the people that worked for me to get rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| Unfortunately, they procrastinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| I procrastinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| I came in front of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| I was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| My husband is a general contractor and has recently redone a house on Villa that was atrocious and made it truly one of the jewels of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4184)|
| 1:09:56| There is a rendering in here of what we plan to do to the office on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| I have planted, since MPC, 40 Leland cypresses to create a vegetative barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4200)|
| 1:10:08| I face the cemetery, and on my right is the giant panache lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| I don't have a neighbor on the left that faces Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| My two neighbors face the road that is off to the side that I cannot recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| Unfortunately, another neighbor has decided to take down very mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| I have contacted my landscaper to add additional mature trees in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4231)|
| 1:10:40| That's the gist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Any questions for her, or we can go to Mr. Rowe, who wants to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| You will have two minutes after he speaks to reply if you would like to at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| Mr. Rowe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| My name is Holland Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike, and I'm sort of serving two caps here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| I was asked to read this into the record representing Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| My wife is a board member, and I'm in the general membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| When the one-year plan update meeting was held in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| staff proposed an amendment to change from medium-density residential to medium-residential office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| with an area northwest and south side of Tazewell Pike and northeast of Jacksboro Pike, southwest of the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| Those in attendance asked that it not be done because there were still several viable houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| It would have made it easier to go from medium-density office to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| As a result of these concerns, this change in the one-year plan was taken off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| This is not southwest of the cemetery, but directly across from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| There are still two houses south being used as residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| We're concerned about the disregard of the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| The property at the corner of Fieldcrest and Tazewell might ask for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| since chip-by-chip by the one-year plan is being disregarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| In January 2007, you denied a request from owners south of the property in questions to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| from medium-density residential to office in O-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| It appears that the property in question is already being used as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| Should the owners of this property be rewarded for disregarding the current zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| And this is my letter to the city council from the Tazewell Pike Beverly Station Neighborhood Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4355)|
| 1:12:44| We're requesting the denial of the proposed one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| and rezoning for the property tax ID number 58LD028.01| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4368)|
| 1:12:55| on the northwest side of Tazewell Pike, southwest of Fieldcrest Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| Our neighborhood has tried to be a good neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| and over the last few years has agreed at separate times to two rezonings of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| in the same block as this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Those properties were in need of repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| so the neighbors agreed to the office rezoning as the developer requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| At the one-year plan meeting of 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| two other nearby properties were designated for office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| Ken Pruitt of MPC was advised by several residents of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| about the office rezoning designation of these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| and how it would encroach on the residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| We thought during the discussion at that meeting that since the one-year plan was changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| the line was drawn as to where the office zone would end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| Now yet another property is seeking rezoning and a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| If MPC continues to approve rezonings to office on a property-by-property basis without having a boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| soon the residential neighbors will be crowded out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| and the domino effect will continue on down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| This type of decision made by MPC makes it increasingly difficult for neighbors to try to work with developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| because we do not know where the effect will end if we allow even one property to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| At the MPC meeting regarding this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| it was made clear that the property owner knew what the zoning was prior to this recent purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| As a neighborhood, we respectfully request the city council deny the one-year plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4469)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| You have two minutes to reply if you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Well, I appreciate that I was operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| That unbeknownst to me, I was operating there because the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| has been giving me a business license at 3503 Chasuble Pike for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| I thought you could operate a business out of a home with two or less employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| I have two and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| The cutoff date or the cutoff point, when I bought the place, it's not pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| It's a vinyl-sided, ugly house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| When Panache was put up, I didn't really say anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| because I knew mine was an office and I would be rezoned one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| At MPC, the meeting that we had, they felt like the natural cutoff would be me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| since I'm the last house that faces the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| What I'm trying to do is not devalue anyone's property value but greatly enhance it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| because I can't sell it in the future as a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| I personally would not want children playing in the backyard where there's a parking lot with 30-something people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| What I'm trying to do is enhance the entire historic Chasuble Pike district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| by fortunately being married to a builder who's incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| But if not, I'm going to end up one day having to rent this place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| and it's going to be a recreation of a cross from Briarcliff where you've got three houses that are run down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| I personally know there are people that live in the third one and have for over a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| and there's no electricity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| So I'm really not the evil person who wants to come into Fountain City and detract from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| because I think I've already proven, and you will see in this, that I have added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| The chairman of the Fountain City Town Hall is completely behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| He has seen what my husband and I have done in Fountain City and how committed we are to Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| So I would obviously disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| Mr. Mayor, I'd like to see the photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| If you could go ahead and pass those out, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| I was told there were only nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| No, there's only nine voting members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| The ones with placards in front of their names are the nine voting members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4616)|
| 1:17:13| The next one is the lady over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| No, we're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Just go straight over there and then you're in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4638)|
| 1:17:31| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4652)|
| 1:17:39| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| My knee was on the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| Just a few issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| I mean, I, like Councilman Bailey and Councilman Becker, were at Fountain City Town Hall last night for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4667)|
| 1:17:55| I did not hear anything of any measure of support concerning this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4675)|
| 1:18:04| I know Mr. Rowe said he was here on behalf of two organizations, including Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| We have other town hall members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| Just to name a couple, Bob Davis and the great Barbara Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| Sitting out there and getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| I think it's clear from the record that the house, when it was purchased, was a residentially zoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| This council, well, five members of this council set through a situation a number of years ago in the Dean Hill area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4709)|
| 1:18:38| where someone bought a piece of house that was zoned residential and moved offices in it and caused a lot of strife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| Using just my institutional knowledge on this area, since I drive by it on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4725)|
| 1:18:52| I have no doubt that what they've done elsewhere is great, and if they want to do great things here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| they still can no matter the zoning or the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| What I unfortunately did hear was that if we get this zoning, we are going to do these great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| But if we don't get this zoning, it's going to turn into potentially problematic properties at the corner of Tazewell Pike and Briarcliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4747)|
| 1:19:17| But this council, us, and the predecessors of four other people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| we've been through this exact same situation with adjoining properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4763)|
| 1:19:32| This council and predecessors of four people supported rezoning to put property in that's rezoned office across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4772)|
| 1:19:40| It supported changing from residential property to office property this side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4780)|
| 1:19:48| And my recollection is that those properties were going to be the last properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| that the proverbial line in the sand was drawn at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| I've got, I guess, an unhealthy obsession with looking at how people vote on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| At MPC, there were five commissioners that opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| Four of them are current or former citizens of the Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| So the people who live in this neck of the woods, or in the case of Nick Pavlis, formerly lived in this neck of the woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| that are familiar with it, those are the ones who opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| I'm not sure that there's been anything that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| I've, you know, talked to folks in Fountain City, went to Fountain City town hall with this on my tongue to ask people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| what the impression was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| And my knowledge of this area does not lead me to believe that this is the best appropriate use for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4840)|
| 1:20:47| I'm going to move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| I guess, Mr. Allen, just to say I don't think the denial of this or the questions about it have anything to do with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| or the work you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Obviously, you've done a great job with the house on Via.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| A lot of this has to do with some of the creep and how we've got a responsibility, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| to tell neighborhoods this is a line and this is where it stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| And I think this is an area, as Mr. Frost said, where we said to the neighborhood up there, oh, the line's going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| Well, no, now we're going to move to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| And at some level, it's not necessarily anything you've done wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| It's been problems that have been going on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| But I think this is a good time to say this is we said the line stops here, and I think we should stick with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| And I think that's an important thing we have to say, not just to folks in Fountain City but all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| that we can allow things to get up to a line and not go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| And I hope you'll continue to be an active neighbor in the Fountain City area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| and supportive of what's going on and a good neighbor there despite this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| I really commend you on the attractiveness and the improvement of streetscape that you have already proven that you can do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4918)|
| 1:22:07| But I have to agree with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| Tonight we have already approved a rezoning, which is adjacent to a neighborhood which I was very concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| called MPC, talked to Mr. Pruitt, and he said this is the last house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| This house now faces on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| So, obviously, it is a house which is in transition, was no longer going to be able to be residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| and certainly not a prime residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| So it bothered me not to approve that change in zoning for that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| But I know that in my district there is just, Mr. Frost has already alluded to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| where we have the very difficult situation where someone wanted to, in their own home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| which they were living in and had owned, they wanted to have their own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| But it was going to make a difference and probably slowly erode the nature of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4979)|
| 1:23:07| So I think this council has demonstrated in the past that that is something we just can't support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| because we do have a sense that neighborhood, the integrity of a neighborhood, really needs to be respected and supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| And, unfortunately, I think you're located in a situation where that's the strong sense with your neighbors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=4999)|
| 1:23:27| But I know they appreciate what you have done to improve the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| I would certainly hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| Panache just cut down three 80-year-old trees so they could see their sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| Well, I'm confident they do, and this is very attractive, and I commend you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| And there are a lot of areas in Knoxville they could use you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Yes, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| I just want to say this, that I was at the town hall East meeting last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| and not only did I not hear anything positive about this, but I didn't hear anything about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| So I don't want to give the false impression or hear the false impression that there was any, you know, negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| or there was nothing said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| I've never voted on for commercial creep or office creep or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| and I do appreciate your enthusiasm and all the things that you intend to do, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| And, unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to go out and look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| And I'd be inclined to ask the council to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| I don't know how many of you have had the chance to go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| I felt like I had a good feeling about that area, having been there, around there a number of times and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| But I, for one, would like to ask for a postponement or some consideration for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| There's a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Discussing now the motion to postpone only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| I'm a believer that some people who haven't had a chance to look at it deserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| I don't have any problem with the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| and I don't know if it makes a difference to the district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| I'll ask how, you know, Mr. Rowe and the other folks that are here tonight for that, how they feel about the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5106)|
| 1:25:18| Mr. Rowe, would anybody like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| If you don't want to speak, you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| Can I interject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| Speaking to the new chairman, and I've had a really interesting day, so I'm trying to remember his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| He, too, was not at the meeting last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| I, unfortunately, could not be there due to a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| He said it wasn't discussed at all last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| and that he was speaking personally to the two women that were most opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| So, yeah, I mean, my understanding, again, was it wasn't discussed at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| and it wasn't even on the agenda yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| Fountain City Town Hall had a board meeting before their meeting last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| and I talked to Mark Campin at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| But, Mr. Rowe, how do you feel about a postponement for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| Do you object or are you fine with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Are you saying you cannot object?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| The motion was for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Is that right, Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| In the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| Any further discussion on the motion, which is now on the floor, to postpone for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Can we wrap postponing the second one, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| There's a plan amendment and then a rezoning, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| Do we want to do them both at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Mr. Swanson says that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| The motion, then, is to postpone both of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| I know when people come, you'd like to have it dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| But I think there will be council folks following up on this this week to make certain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| it gets looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| 12AA is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of Tillery Drive, south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| of Bounds Road, from R2 General Residential District to C3 General Commercial District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| Edward McCarty Applicant, Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Is there anybody in the audience who wants to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| I know somebody had called the office today to try and catch me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| And they actually gave you my home number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| And I never get home during council days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| So, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| I missed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| I know you tried to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| I'm the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| I'm Edward McCarty, 528 Fountain Gate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| Would anybody like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| The reason why I want to get it rezoned is basically everything around me is zoned C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| or C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| And I'm the only one sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| So, basically, that's what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| 12 BB is in ordinance approving the request of Kelly Nichols for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| from low-density residential to neighborhood commercial for property located on the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| side of Washington Pike, southwest side of Mill Road, Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| I see Mr. King and the applicants have moved to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| Would you like to hear from them first, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| Whoever would like to speak first and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| It may be simpler, Mr. Mayor and members, if I do, because I'm here to reiterate my request for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5299)|
| 1:28:27| I've met with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| I was suggesting or requesting a postponement for four weeks because in two weeks I'll be taking depositions for two days in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5309)|
| 1:28:37| and not be able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| And discussions with the applicant, they were concerned about that delay of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| I did tell them that despite the fact I can't be here, I can probably get somebody from my office to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| and suggesting that we postpone it for two weeks, which I'm willing to agree to from my standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5332)|
| 1:29:03| Actually, I guess at this point I'm asking a postponement for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| I was contacted yesterday afternoon, the middle of the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| by a person who had basically said they were calling on behalf of some of the property owners in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5352)|
| 1:29:19| They are setting up a meeting to discuss this particular rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| and had a number of questions that they would like answers to or would like advice about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5365)|
| 1:29:32| and would I be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| I told them, yes, I received a phone call back today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| That meeting is now scheduled for that activity to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| Essentially what I'm asking is a two-week postponement for an opportunity to meet with some of the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| who have questions about how this affects their property that adjoins or is in the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5392)|
| 1:30:00| And I think it's probably good to point out I have not yet been told by any of them that they have any opposition to this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5400)|
| 1:30:13| Their concern and questions are more along the line of what should I do about my property that is in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5413)|
| 1:30:21| If you look at the map, the two pieces of property involved are the piece that one parcel that is at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5421)|
| 1:30:31| or the corner of Mill Road and Washington Pike and then the parcel that is immediately to the south of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5431)|
| 1:30:41| If you look in that area, you will see a number of small lots where people have their homes that, no doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5441)|
| 1:30:50| are probably their life's biggest investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| And their concern is over about what the effect of this rezoning is as to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5454)|
| 1:31:02| And I can only expect or imagine that a number of those questions or concerns would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5462)|
| 1:31:09| if these two parcels are rezoned and, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| a convenience store goes at the corner of Mill Road and Washington Pike and a CVS or a Walgreens goes on the other parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5473)|
| 1:31:23| then what is there for the future for the remaining property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| even if they decided to go and rezone each of those parcels commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| what would they be able to look at trying to do with their properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| And I thought and still believe that it is a better thing to do here to sit down with that group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| that are around this property and tell them if you want to rezone your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| and you get a petition in and start that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| then whoever is looking at developing any property in this area, whoever it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| whether it's this applicant or somebody that this applicant wants to sell or lease to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| they're looking at the potential of a totally different kind of commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| as they would be if each one of those other parcels of property started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| Well, I'm going to rezone my parcel and, you know, it's a third of an acre or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5542)|
| 1:32:30| What does that get them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| And I've, you know, some of the questions were identified to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| Well, they might like to, some of these other people might like to rezone their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| or consider rezoning it, but what does that do to my taxes, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| Those are questions that can be answered, but I couldn't get them answered between yesterday and today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| I respectfully ask for, as I say, two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| That meeting will have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| I'm not sure how much time they will have to take any action based on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| but at least that meeting will have occurred by then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| and they can at least be in a better position to evaluate their own personal position related to their own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| and its potential future utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| This is just one of those where I think it's better to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| It's a fairly constricted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| You've got the railroad there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| You've got Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| You go down Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| There's a point at which those lots along Washington Pike are looking at 100 feet of frontage or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| maybe 400 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| It's a decent sized piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| but each one in and of itself doesn't represent that much of a value as you get down to looking at commercial utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5616)|
| 1:33:45| I'd like to have the two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| We'd like to hear from the applicants now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| If you could give us your name and address one more time, and then go ahead and tell us your view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| My name is Michael DiPietro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| I'm at 7601 Mays Chapel Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| We don't know of any community opposition to what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| I've gotten together with my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| We all know, or you may not be aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| Washington Pike is a fairly expanding commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| It's exploding, and our small corner is just one corner that will be developed at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| As a citizen, in talking to my neighbors, we wanted to get together to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| There may be other lots along Washington Pike or Mill Road where people may want to develop them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5669)|
| 1:34:36| but that would take a fairly large-scale operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| We're on a good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| We're in the corner, and we've come together in an agreement to try to rezone our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| and we would like to put that forward to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| I'm concerned that the talking to other citizens, whether or not their citizens are actually talking to Mr. King directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5695)|
| 1:35:03| or there's an independent third party that's brokering that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| I don't see how that should impact what me and my two other neighbors are trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| And once again, as was stated earlier, this is in another council member's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| so I would look forward to hearing from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| I will say that I think the postponement may be well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| I am aware of a, if I'm not mistaken, I am aware of a church that sits right in the middle of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5728)|
| 1:35:36| all this activity that's going on out there that is a very old historic African-American church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| and also has a graveyard around in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| and I'm concerned if they've been talked to about what's going on in this area and everything that's going on around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| So two weeks may give an opportunity to make sure that at least everybody's aware and on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| or at least have been talked to about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| So a postponement may be worthwhile in that endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| I don't wish to deny anybody their use of their property or delay it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| but I do know that there has been a lot of frenetic activity out there with regards to properties in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| and with regards to issues around this church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| So I'm a little concerned about the impact there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Mr. King, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| I'm not sure if I was paying enough attention when you were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| Who exactly is it that you're speaking on behalf of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| I received a talk today to Alicia Marshall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| who for a number of years has had contact with a number of these property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| and I talked to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| The only individual property owner she mentioned to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| as her knowing that she was interested in perhaps selling her property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| and interested in perhaps rezoning it, is a woman by the name of Almeda Chesney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| And I understand they're already in communication with her about the possibility of including her property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| which is that little bitty triangular-shaped piece right behind that corner piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| But it is Alicia Marshall that I talked to who has talked to a number of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| There's a little road out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| It's on your map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| She is talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| She talked about a couple or more of the property owners along that road that apparently doesn't have a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| It may be Renwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| She had talked to some people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| and some other people in the area who were expressing interest in the kinds of questions I suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5853)|
| 1:37:40| I haven't talked to any of those individual property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| That's the purpose of the meeting that is now scheduled for me to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| But the person that I was contacted by to ask would I be willing to meet and talk with them was Alicia Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| As someone else alluded, I'd like to hear from the district council member at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| and see what he has to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| Mr. Becker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| I guess since Mr. Frost wants me to, I'm going to toss in a monkey wrench here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| In looking at this property, I was sort of concerned about development happening with C1 and maybe that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| It really scares me to know, Mr. King, that people all up and down this fairly narrow road want to turn commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5901)|
| 1:38:29| I think it's a problem we've got all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| So my inclination would be to say we should not rezone this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| that this will be opening a barn door to a major shift that I don't think we want to have happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| And most interestingly, although it says in our packet here that the sector plan says late industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| I've got the sector plan here, and clearly this was from last June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| This was all low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| This intersection was not pulled out for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| But I'm concerned about what we're doing in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Mr. DiPietro, at the corner of Washington Pike and Babelay, that would be the northeast corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| That's an old gas station, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| Babelay and Washington Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| Yeah, there's a gas station there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| It's like a, I don't know, Superstop or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| It's where Babelay used to, was moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| I guess that's the one you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| And then you further go out Babelay and you go out by the old nursery, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| Yeah, you'll go past the nursery there, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| The lady with you, is she a property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| I am an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| I'm Kelly Nichols, 6320 Old Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| And as for Ms. Chesney, who is to your left, that is not in the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| I have a verbal agreement with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| She is looking for another home already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| She is very much aware of what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| She has some family issues that has kept her from going with us on this whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| Her daughter was in the middle of a wedding, and she didn't want to do anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| I don't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| But even though this is on the edge of the city-county line, I've got some friends who live out on Babelay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6014)|
| 1:40:21| so I am familiar with the area, and I do have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| Near this intersection there used to be an older home that had gotten grown up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| and then it's near the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| I didn't realize, I mean, I just know it's a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| And I'm concerned about that intersection because a lot of traffic is funneled through that intersection every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6035)|
| 1:40:43| to those new subdivisions that are being built out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| Mr. King, when is that meeting supposed to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| Right now, I'm told, as of today, it's Saturday, I believe the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| Does that look like the right date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Saturday the 23rd at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| Mrs. Pilo is getting ready to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Actually, Ms. Roddy has her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| I was going to, unless someone wants to say something that's not germane to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| I was going to go ahead and make a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| Well, I just wanted to ask a question about the postponement and about the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| I just wanted to ask who is going to attend the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| Who is going to be invited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Who is going to be notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Well, you know, I guess I just notified everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| Well, who is everybody, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| I wish I knew who everybody was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| Like I say, all I know is there are a number of property owners in that area who are asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6097)|
| 1:41:45| Now, I don't know whether that's five or ten, but certainly if the applicant wants to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| they can if they want to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| Well, I guess what was in my mind is there are a lot of bodies out there that are on their own homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6114)|
| 1:42:00| who may not have noticed that there might be some change coming into their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| And so I was rather thinking that a meeting that does not include all of the residents of this area would not to me be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6127)|
| 1:42:21| I think the outcome could be very different than what we might expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| Well, let me just say that if you look at, and I'll see to it that at least an invitation is extended to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6145)|
| 1:42:34| there are one, two, three, four parcels to the south of these two parcels that front on Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6154)|
| 1:42:44| Well, one of them doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| One of them fronts on that little driveway area, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| There's one in front that immediately adjoins the southernmost parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6170)|
| 1:42:57| There are two there and then two before you hit the railroad track down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6177)|
| 1:43:05| I will see to it that those four persons, if they are available, will be notified of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| and about one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight parcels to the west of this going down Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6190)|
| 1:43:20| It's the folks on Washington Pike that I'm considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| I'll do my best to see to it that they get notice of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Let me go to Ms. Roddy first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| Ms. Roddy, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| I wanted to thank Councilman Becker for referencing the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| I have both B.B. and C.C. marked all over, you know, what's going on with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| And before we're asked to consider this again, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| if there could be typically in the cover sheet there's some reference to what effect this has on the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| or what the one-year plan recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| And for some reason, as I read through the documents, and maybe I missed it, but it just seemed to be missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| And I think it's just critical that this Council consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| and be respectful of the one-year plans when we're looking at plan amendments and rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| A lot of staff time goes into creating those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| A lot of citizen input goes into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| And I share Council's concern about this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| And before I reconsider it, I'd like to pull a copy of the plan and know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Did I miss it, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| Well, there's a, yeah, the one-year plan versus the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| This is a one-year plan amendment request here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| But then what's recommended for this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| It's the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| That's what I'm trying to, I guess, get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| The staff report says it's LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| And do you have the latest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Yes, this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| And this may be a reference to the previous version of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| But whenever we reconsider that, if this could be copied and included in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| that would be informational to me, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Now, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Let me go back once again to my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| At whatever meeting you're going to have, Attorney King and anyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| someone needs to make sure that they contact the Oak Grove Amazon Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6300)|
| 1:45:07| That's a church that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| I think Larry Bryce may be the head of the trustee board dealing with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| My grave concern is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| that church not be damaged in any kind of commercial activity or rezoning that goes on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| And it may be that we end up honoring what the sector plan says, but they need to be invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| Somebody from that church or that pastor needs to be invited to the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| Because as I look at this zoning request here and see what's going on around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| and the county on the other side, very quickly a quick commercial influx,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| and it could be the hole inside the donut with commercial all around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| and really get landlocked and have some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| And I would hate to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| So let's make sure that I'm requesting that you make sure that they're brought into the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| whatever discussion you're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| Since you requested, I will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| I appreciate that, Attorney King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| Mr. Peebles, do you have something else or is that an old line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| I think the applicant would like to say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| I'm just concerned that the person that contacted Mr. King does not live in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| And I believe that she works for a large developer who's working along that road front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| So I just question the motives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| If we're really looking at those neighbors and their concerns about their property, I can truly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| I have no issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| But if we're looking at some other type of competitive influence, then I have a challenge with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| That bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| Let me assure you that that's not my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| My concern is truly that church and the graveyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| And I don't want to put years on that church, but that church is at least 75, close to maybe 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| I think it's 1800s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| I can appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| It is one of the oldest African-American institutions in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| And so I would be gravely concerned about any negative impact on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| I'm sorry, just one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| But I think that, you know, my one little bit isn't necessarily the epitome of commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6421)|
| 1:47:09| We know right now that there's a target that's a quarter of a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| There's a circuit city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| There's a whole shopping center at Murphy Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| It's not me that's doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| That's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| And I'm just kind of following suit with the flow of what's happening within that part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| I think you could totally discount what Mr. King and his clients represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| I think Councilman and Vice Mayor Brown brought up, you know, valid concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| And I was suggesting to Mrs. Roddy here that she drives that intersection because there are some serious concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6458)|
| 1:47:46| As you travel south, the road, the way it pitches off, it's what I would call it is a country road that has become urbanized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6466)|
| 1:47:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| The motion on the floor is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| Is this both B and C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| Double B and double C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| Is that right, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| The motion is to postpone double B and double C for two weeks, and that has been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| 12DD is an ordinance to rezone the neighborhoods of Castle Heights, Sherwood Forest, Ridgecrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| and Belcaro from R1 Low Density Residential District to R1EN Established Neighborhood District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| excluding parcel 058BD033 Metropolitan Planning Commission applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| There are a number of people here from that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| Suzanne Matheny has been corresponding with a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| I've been happy to attend the meetings out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| For folks that have noticed, the person who is requested to be taken out of it is Arthur Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| who I think drug his wife into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| So Mr. Seymour was here earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| Is he still here over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| Well, I always attempted to move to amend this to put him inside of it just for sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6543)|
| 1:49:10| But I did confer with the leadership of the group that is taking charge with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6550)|
| 1:49:18| It is their preference that Mr. Seymour and Suzanne Seymour would be in it, but they are willing to let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6558)|
| 1:49:26| So we'll let Mr. Seymour off the hook for tonight, but remind him it will be brought up again in two weeks' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| I hate to disagree with my council brother up in the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| but I don't think it makes any sense to do rezonings like this and exclude a property owner for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| So I think this is a great rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| We've done a lot of this in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| But I'd like to amend this to put whatever the address is, well, put Arthur back in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6590)|
| 1:49:57| because I think that's the way we do zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| There's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| There's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| Discussion on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| Mr. Seymour might want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6609)|
| 1:50:22| I had put two lots together a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 1805 Ridgecrest Drive, Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| I'll basically stand by what I said in MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| I put two lots together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| I don't remember how long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| It's been within the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| I've got over two acres there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| I have no intention of subdividing those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| I have, as a matter of fact, garden work is going on there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6647)|
| 1:50:56| But I would hate to preclude some future property owner from separating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| They would still be over an acre each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| So I was very happy with the way I was and wanted to be left alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| Any further comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| I'll make some other general comments at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| Would it be the end of the world if you got added to this, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| It's not going to be the end of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| I have some philosophical difficulty with this type of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| in an area where there are a number of lots still available that are vacant that can be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| There are platted lots out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| There's one right down the street from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| There's one catty corner from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| And if you go down into Sherwood Forest, there are a number of other lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| I cannot see the harm that is being protected against coming to that area any time soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6703)|
| 1:51:51| And I would hate to discourage infill development in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| and I hope we aren't doing that with this type of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| But at least for the time being, you're confident that you have good representation on city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| For the time being, temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| It's contingent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| What, two more years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| He said you'd tell him after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| There's a motion to amend on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| If, you know, one of the folks out of the group of the neighbors that were working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| if they want to, you know, address it, this is the opportunity, whether it's Suzanne or Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6748)|
| 1:52:37| I'm not going to jump up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| I'm not going to change the situation where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| We've added, I hope, our last addition, which was a guest home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| But I'm just worried about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| I, you know, maybe should have kept the two lots separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| I think we do have somebody moving down to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| Suzanne Matheny, 1710 Ridgecrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Arthur is a good neighbor of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| I like him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| And we would welcome Arthur and Susan to be in our zoning proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| But, Arthur, I don't see this as anything that would keep people from developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6798)|
| 1:53:24| As I understand it, it is to help people develop to maintain the integrity of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6804)|
| 1:53:31| with some certain stipulations that would keep some things from happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6811)|
| 1:53:38| that we've already seen happening on adjacent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| Small houses being put up, several houses being put up on very small lots with architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6823)|
| 1:53:51| that just does not comply or blend in with what is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| I personally don't see it as a restriction on me as a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| I have two lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| I welcome some restrictions there that would keep the neighborhood to have the same integrity that it does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6842)|
| 1:54:11| I think I speak well for the majority of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| We've had at least two open meetings with MPC representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| We've had at least a third meeting in our neighborhood watch where this has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| We've sent out newsletters and e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| No one has objected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| And as we have collected signatures, most of those have been collected as a result of personal conversations with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6870)|
| 1:54:38| If there's objection from the neighborhood, we haven't heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| In fact, we've heard nothing but support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Let me make this suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| This is going to be heard on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| Something can be, you know, changed later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| But what I'm going to propose is to accept a friendly amendment and see if in two weeks' time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| assuming that this property is added to the overlay, Mr. Seymour can see the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6902)|
| 1:55:10| So, you know, I certainly understand property rights mean different things to different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| But as this council has discussed before, you also have to be concerned about the property rights of the adjoining property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| So I'll accept that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| We'll see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| And in two weeks' time, we may be back here on the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| We might amend it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| Right now, the motion, there's a motion to amend on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Right about then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| Now, we're voting on the motion to amend, which Mr. Becker moved that would include Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| All opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| Were there others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Mr. Bailey and Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Now, we're back on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| Any further discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| 12 EE is an ordinance approving the request of Lawrence T. Kennedy for one-year plan amendment for mixed uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6968)|

| 1:56:30| I guess I want to ask Mr. Swanson a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| My sense is I would like to keep this the way it is, mixed use, office low-density residential, medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=6994)|
| 1:56:42| We could do a no motion or a motion to deny to accomplish that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| I think I'll make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| There's a motion to say deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| Is the applicant on this property here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| That's what I was going to ask, because I know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| Mr. Kennedy, I don't see Mr. Kennedy here, so I'm going to assume it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| The motion is to deny and the second, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| Yeah, I guess just to explain again, the sector plan that was done, adopted in June of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7029)|
| 1:57:16| has this area pulled out for some very special planning that is a office low-density and medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7036)|
| 1:57:23| There was a lot of discussion at the MPC about sticking with the plan that we did last year, and I'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| I haven't heard anything from the developer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| I guess I'm a little concerned about that, but he knew that it was controversial and didn't step up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7053)|
| 1:57:43| If you've looked at the location, this is a very rural residential area, so I'd be very concerned about this in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7063)|
| 1:57:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| The motion is to deny, and it's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| Any further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| All those in favor of denying, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7080)|

| 1:58:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| Councilman Holquist, I want to make sure I'm correct here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| This is the area about Judge Hastie's area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| Yes, Judge William Hastie's natural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| It's the planning process for that city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| So the monies are going to be used purely and solely for that planning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| The design center will conduct that process, and these are reimbursements for their internal costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| The caption says certain efforts, but then there is some specificness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| The Little Bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| I'm not sure why that was written that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| Let me ask the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| I've never asked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| I mean, I've talked to you guys about this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| Has there ever been any signage at all put up there to at least let folks know that there's been a designated area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| Well, I can answer that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| But the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| But there's an access problem, and that's the reason we haven't signed it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| Mayor, you might want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Yeah, there's an access and a parking issue, which we need to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| Part of this planning problem is we really haven't publicized the park that much until we solve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7183)|
| 1:59:49| Is that right, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| You know, I guess because of his historic importance, and Councilman Hopeless knows what I mean by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7192)|
| 1:59:59| this gentleman, Judge Hastie, who grew up in South Knoxville, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| reached the pinnacle of the judiciary at a time in this country when it didn't happen with African-Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7204)|
| 2:00:11| And there's a lot of his memorabilia and things at the Tibet Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| He was appointed a very high post in this country at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| when everybody didn't even have the right to go to the same education institutions together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| So I think it's a very important area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| And let me also say my understanding, Councilman Hopeless, is that his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| he has some family members that are still around, Mayor, who live maybe in the D.C. area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| that have access to or are in a position that there may be some funds that could be going through them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7236)|
| 2:00:43| for help with this park and may have an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| I don't know if we've ever contacted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| We have made an initial contact there without much success so far, but we will keep trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| Well, anything I can do to help out with that, and maybe we can get some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Vice Mayor Brown, maybe you and I can go visit him, and we'll talk to him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| I'd love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| I think the mayor's got a plan or two, since he doesn't, you know, use them anymore with PILOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| that he could let us borrow the flyer up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Joe was talking about taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| Move to strike from the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| But my point is, and I don't want to, and I was glad to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| and I'm glad to see we're moving on it, but it's a very important natural area for a very important person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| and I think we need to make sure we do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| Last item on our agenda is public forum, and one Mr. Alonzo Montgomery has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7286)|

| 2:01:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| We noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| You never give nobody five minutes of me, and you know, and the public realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| You know, you let all your good old buddies come up here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| and the rules are opposition five minutes, four or five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| For your buddies, all of them got a little bit of currency, and you all side with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7324)|
| 2:02:10| You all don't need to give them a time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| Nobody went over five minutes all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| I was watching my watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| Check this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| You know, my conclusion in October through January, I started to kick back, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| because that's my Gulf War time, so I kick back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| and I know how to be quiet during that time and meditate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| You know the conclusion I came up with this city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| Mr. Mayor, it's your fifth year going in office, and you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| I thought about your legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| I gave it a lot of thought this last 90 days because, see, you got elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| You beat Madeline with the black vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| You guys have made two or three photo ops out in the black community in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| one at the Hardy building when you all brought the health department in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| That's pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| I could deal with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| The big one, you all had the big thing out there at the store, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| You all let your buddy Leroy and them rip the taxpayers of the city of Knoxville off, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| because I did a little study, and even though I kicked back, I still read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| And I found out, and I've said it before, but I just found proof where a project like 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7395)|
| 2:03:22| Shoot, you've got to give it three years to see if it even gets off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| You all allowed that dude to give you all six months, and the taxpayers got ripped off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7406)|
| 2:03:32| I know where his office is located in Knoxville, and he's a part of the Haslam clan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7412)|
| 2:03:39| And I said, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Mayor Haslam hasn't had any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| Give this gentleman, give the mayor of this city not any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| When Mayor Ash was in office, he got opposition every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| But no mayor is going to come here and do what Mayor Ash did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| You can grin, sir, but I'm going to get to the meat of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| You give me one minute, I'm going to get to the meat of it because I sit back and thought about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| I've seen you on television between October and January making photo ops everywhere on television, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| And I've got great respect for you, but I've seen you making photo ops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| Woodall making photo ops at the skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| Woodall running that tribe one in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| He ain't done nothing in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| He ain't done nothing to try to improve that corridor of Martin Luther King, of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| But they're making money in my community that I so dearly love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| But yet they're not doing nothing, but they're around here building skate parks, and they're all making photo ops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7479)|
| 2:04:45| Then Woodall comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| The citizens see me in this last three months, and they say to me, why you haven't been uptown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| They're listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Then Vice Mayor Brown, he goes in and gets a doggone resolution passed with no panhandling uptown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7494)|
| 2:05:03| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080212?start=7503)|
