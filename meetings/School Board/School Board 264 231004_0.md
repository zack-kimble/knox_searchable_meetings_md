| 0:17:57| I guess the question I asked Garfield is what's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| So just kind of answer the question, why not delay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| What's the concern if we do delay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Madam Chair, Mr. Triplett, once again, I think we discussed this in the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| This is a premier piece of property that we are getting undervalued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| And my concern is a sought out piece of property like that would go fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| And I do know for a fact that there is an interested buyer just for the agency that works directly with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| who knows all of the potential buyers that are at bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| And then Ms. Owen, what's the reason for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| I guess what we hope to gain in the 30 days that we don't have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| Looking at the property search summary is one place that I'd like to start to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| When we were originally looking for land and until as far as I know our annual retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1134)|
| 0:19:03| everyone in this room thought that we were looking for an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| And when we were at our annual retreat, we were told that it was now being considered to be a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| And it was my understanding at that time and maybe because of the quickness of the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| but it was my, I should say, assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| It was my assumption that that was based on the location of the property and suitability and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| However, looking at the property search summary, what I see in all of the considerations for property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1171)|
| 0:19:42| is whether they are appropriate for a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| So why are we looking at a property summary talking about why each of these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| may or may not be appropriate for a middle school when what we were looking for was an elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| So I would like to have some additional time to find the answers to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| Especially since we just got this document right before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| What we have discussed all along has been an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| We haven't had input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| I think it's really important for us to keep in mind that we don't function individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| We function only as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| And so if decisions like this are being made outside of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| that's something I think we need to consider as we look at what we are planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| So if the need is for an elementary school, which is what we have been told all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| then I'm very confused about why all of the property summaries talk about middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| I'm also confused about why we're making assumptions about what parents want for the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| when we haven't talked to parents at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| Everyone that I have heard from, with the notable exception of a person who works in tourism for Farragut Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1269)|
| 0:21:20| has had serious concerns about the lack of communication both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| They're concerned that they haven't been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| They're concerned that they haven't been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| And it's especially egregious to me that our principals found out in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1290)|
| 0:21:41| and that they were never part of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| They are right there with the students every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| They understand the needs of the students for a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| I think we've gotten plenty of emails explaining the difference in the primary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| and the intermediate school and the size differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| And I can attest that the difference in sizes of everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| when you go from K-1 and K-2 to K-3, K-4, K-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| it's a huge difference from the height of your chairs to the height of your cafeteria line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| And to just think about just moving those students into a larger school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1344)|
| 0:22:33| that has not been designed for them when they are in a newer building designed specifically for their needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| is nonsensical to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| And I need someone to explain the whys of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| I need to understand that before I can vote on this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| So those are my main concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| I think we've also seen some emails with lots of other conjecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| And I think we would do ourselves a disservice to not at least look into things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| and find out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| We do our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| And this property has been on the market for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| It's obviously not moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| So I can't imagine that the owners would take it out from under us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1398)|
| 0:23:27| and not allow us that additional 30 days to do our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| My follow-up question to that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| I think there is a little bit of confusion between buying property and then what we're putting on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Does that property meet the needs for whatever we decide to put on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| Or is it specifically geared toward a specific type of school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| We buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| We don't really have an option to put anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| I think I need to answer a few questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| The reason why what you're looking at for the most recent searches were middle schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| because we have already answered the question of an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| The searches have been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| This is on year three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| And so whether we could put an elementary school on that property is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| The question was if we were to put a middle school on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| would that be a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| The middle school conversation came up when we wanted to take before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| not a we're giving you an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| We don't have a future plan for the town of Farragut or a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| as the Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, Beaumont solution and the South Knoxville solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| And we will continue to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| We will put every plan on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| That includes an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| That includes a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| That includes a mega elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| That includes rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| And one of the reasons that this conversation really became a robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| conversation is because we did listen to the community in Mill Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| And that was a painful transition because it was rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| And so we wanted to put that on the table for parents who did not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| to rezone their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| And the reality of it is we're at capacity at both Farragut Primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| and both Farragut Intermediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| And so we wanted to put all options on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Again, we don't make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| We're not a government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| We bring suggestions to the board and proposals to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| And so that's one of the reasons the language you see is taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| that information to see can a middle school work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| We know for a certainty an elementary school can work just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| of the footprint of it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| So and what you'll see at the quarterly work session, my team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| and I have worked very diligently to give every possible scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| and take that to the board and then take that to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| This is no different to Mill Creek when we took FAQs and we combed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| through every suggestion, question that the community had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| and we responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| And so we want to do our due diligence to ensure that when we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| a decision and a solution for a community that we look at not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| the here and now but for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| And we look at the middle schools and the high schools in totality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| And we would like this solution to last for the next 10 to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| I'll quit after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| I just I think we're a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| I think some of the e-mails we're getting are like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| what are you putting there and some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| And I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| And they've got a process they're going to go through to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| that voices are heard related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| And so I can I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| I think the property is a different matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| We've been looking at it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| But when I came on the board, there was still discussion around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| the other piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| We've been looking at it for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| We've been looking at it for the property to go and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| the purchase and then allow the process to to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| to figure out what the best solution is for Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| on that particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| But I'll be voting to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| This purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Commissioner Shoemaker, you came specifically for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Did you want to speak to it or I just want to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| the opportunity if you wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| You don't have to if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| I wanted to make sure you were recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| John Schoonmaker, Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| One hundred forty four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| Susan can attest to how hard it is to find any available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| property in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I was relating to her earlier how difficult it was when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| I searched for just a building for a senior center in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| fifth district and how difficult that was to find a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| that we could lease at a reasonable price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| And because I was aware that you guys were looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| for property, I had also been looking through the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| to see even if I could find 15 acres that would be accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| to for an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| But it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| You know, the town of Farragut is 90 percent built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| All the good land is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| This particular property has been vacant for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| because it was zoned for residential use only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| But the cost of the land was so high, most of the builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| didn't even take a second look at it because there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| still other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Now that you guys are after it, there's other folks now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| that are saying, well, wait a minute, the school thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| this is an awesome piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| They want it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| And that's why they're willing to pay a premium to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| you're getting the price for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| And the beauty of this is you're getting 41 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| So you can build on half of it if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| And then the other half, you've got that in inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| for 20 years from now if you want to build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| So in my opinion, personally, there's no plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| There's no alternate site to go to that's still close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| to where you need to have unless you want to bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| kids all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| And I don't think you want to put a school at Watt Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| on the side of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| So I think the team did an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| And I specifically came here to speak to you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| specifically came here to support the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| and the staff and Susan, because I think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| a win-win for the 5th District and Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Ms. Vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| And I also want to echo and say that I feel the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| as Ms. Owen and from a lot of the feedback that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| gotten through call and email and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| that people are very surprised and are not in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| of this, mostly because they feel blindsided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| and that if this had been a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| of a presentation or a little bit more of an ease-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| from an elementary school to a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| that they may have felt better about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| One of my questions is, is this property big enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| to house an elementary school and a middle school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| Madam Chair, members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| it would be tight, but the cost of building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| two schools would be astronomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| And next question is, I know that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| we in our board retreat had talked about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| facilities assessment and that we really don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| more learning cottages and that many of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| are at capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| And then we also saw the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| on the growth of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| And then from Ms. Christie and Reverend Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| the South Knox Plan and the East Knox Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| And I wonder if when we, I assume that we are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| for property for schools in both of those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and kind of all of those areas with the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| that we're seeing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| And I guess it's kind of a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| to have a lot more clarity and forward thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| and presentation when we go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| And definitely I think I would feel a lot better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| about voting on this if I understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| I know we've got papers and stuff like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| but I do feel a little overwhelmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| understood kind of like the different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| about the layout of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| And like, if you were to do a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| how would it look and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Could you maybe go through any of that right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| about like a middle school and what that would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| and any sort of ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| I'm going to jump in before and I'll let Dr. Epps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| You know, I just, I want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| I totally understand two things I really want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| It's tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Mr. Schoonmaker made a good comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| You know, when, here's the reality of it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| When the school system's interested in property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| and if we come forward with a whole plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| that we're going to do this, this, and this, that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| and I'll tell you, there is not a full plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| We have options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| We talked through those today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| You know, it's all chicken or the egg, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| When you get to what point of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| if we come forward to the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| and do this full community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| we talk through all the possible options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| of all the different things, and I pledge to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| that our staff would look at 10 years out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| strategic how to use all these buildings, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| If we do that full plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| we've had this conversation with folks in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| that price doubles, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Once they understand, oh, they need this, they need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| So the way this process works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| we work with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| we work with a different property contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| to try to look at these things to find the appropriate land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| To Dr. Adams' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| the middle school's on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| because we're keeping all options open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| We know if the property's big enough for a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| it's big enough for an elementary school, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| We need to look at both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| There is no full-blown plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| but we have to get the property secured first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| If we do the whole plan first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| we will not find, to Mr. Schoonmaker's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| we won't find the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| because it will be gone or it will be double the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| When we started down this journey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| I know Ms. Horn and Mr. Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| were part of that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| off the initial property we pulled out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| That was what we were given by both the realtor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| and also working with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| that that's how this plays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| You can't show all those cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| and then people understand what you're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| especially in a place like Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| or Hardin Valley where property's hard to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| So we did our due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| to continue on that to find the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| I want to be really clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| with what Mr. Triplett said, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| We are thinking strategically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| We don't have the full plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| It's not baked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| I mean, people can believe that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| We do have multiple options that are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| that we're trying to think through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Our main goal is to increase capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| get students out of portables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| and build a long-term plan for the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| and for the students to go to Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| so we can serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| We are extremely excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| about bringing this to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| but we can't get the cart before the horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| and have the full conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| because what happens is you have all these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| about what we need when you're two elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| when you're middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| We need to look at what the needs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| bring to you all, our bosses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| the plans before we go out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| and bring back to you 50,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| who are behind an idea, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| I mean, we pretty much force your hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| at that point, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| So our plan was secure the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| bring to you all the options in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| that we would then want, with your blessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| to take to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Once that happens, we'll bring that input back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| and say here's what the community said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| here's still what we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| kind of what we did as Dr. Adams said with Mill Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| This is still our number one recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| but it's your all's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Here are two other ones on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Here's what we got from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| You all can say, you know, go fish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| but if we don't do it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| then we can't go to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| before we bring it to you guys, our bosses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| and say here are the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| So yes, we have some plans thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| about a middle school and high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| We have some plans thinking about expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| at the elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| We also don't want to be short-sighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| and just solve elementary for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| This kid's got to go somewhere by middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| So we wanted to make sure we found a plot of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| that could serve all those needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| and then we could bring you all a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| and with your blessing, you tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| how we're going to adhere to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| And Ms. Owens is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| I did mention that the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| could be the option that we go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| It still could be the option we go with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| but we don't know that until the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| has given us that permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| So there is really no other plan behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| I just wanted to say that for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| because I agree with Mr. Tripp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| that a lot of the emails we're getting are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| you know, don't do a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| The sinks are too short at the intermediate school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| All that will be part of renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| if we did use those buildings again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| but I just felt like I wanted to say that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| to know that it's not a slide of hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| or something going on under the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| This really is the opportunity by the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| that we feel we can move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| for a plan for Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| So I don't know if that answers your total question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| but I don't know that we have total answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| to those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| and I would also say that if we start talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| about individual plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| we'll write back out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| and if you all do choose to pass on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| it will make it more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Oh, they're going to build two elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| you know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| So like at this point we can't really reveal that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| until we know where our property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| and we bring that to you all to ask what to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| So I was a little long-winded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| but I wanted to make sure to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I guess that changes my question a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Then do we have an ideal goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| for when whatever school goes there would open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| I may defer to Dr. Adams on the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| on how that was laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| I mean, I know the Farragut property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| was part of last year's capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| carried over to this year because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| The timing would, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| probably depend somewhat on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| so I think our plan was to secure the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| this year and then to begin to work that plan out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| depending on which option we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| It could be breaking ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| and building this one out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| and whatever this school is could impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| the other schools, rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| renovations, all those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| that are part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| but this building in and of itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Dr. Adams will probably have a better idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| of what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you, Dr. Reiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| So we would first start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| with the quarterly work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| and we would bring all that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| if the property was approved tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| and we would work with the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| on what proposal the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| wanted to move forward with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| and then we would go before the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| and do multiple community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| and get the community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| and then we would bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| that information back to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| to make a sound decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| From there, we would work with an architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| for the architectural design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| I can tell you that would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| anywhere from six to eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| and then we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| with the actual build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Now, the timeline, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| it depends, as Dr. Reiser alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| it depends on what type of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| we would be building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| and then we would go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| I will say construction has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| from what we thought would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| one year to build a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| is now stretched out to two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Well, so a lot of different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| that have been said that I have made notes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| so I'll try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I feel like I'm going to be all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| So for one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| I feel like I've made things difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| because I wanted the community to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| that this land could be a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| I felt like that was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| and I was interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| that that could be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| I, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| it doesn't matter to me which one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| I want it to be whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| is the best for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| and best for the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| and the families and the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| So regardless of what it ends up being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| right now the issue that we're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| is the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| and to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| I really truly feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| if whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| if we're voting on land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| for this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| my assumption is that the board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| for that district will have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| is representing their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| and will be able to represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| the needs and the feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| So I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| it would be really difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| for a board that has to function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| in public to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| find a piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| in any sort of efficient way at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| I just don't think that that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| that's my expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| If we were buying land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| in Mike's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| I would assume he would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| very heavily involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| in those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| I've been heavily involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| in the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| on all of this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| and on each and every property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Doug Shover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Ryan Dillingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| and Dr. Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| would look at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| and talk through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| what it would accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| What are the problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| What are the issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| How does it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| they've talked about those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| And they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| I think that Dr. Garfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Dr. Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| and Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| said it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| There's just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| there is not a plan B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| as Commissioner Schoonmaker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| If we don't purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| we already have a feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| that says that it would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| expensive to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| the current buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| That would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| it's going to be more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| It's just not the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| There were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| there's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| there's just not more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| that we are focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| on the issue of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| the fact that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| to vote on a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| There,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| he has people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| that are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| that want to pay him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| to build homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| on each acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| $150,000 an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| to build homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| home builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| it has been sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| but he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| I think it was $175,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| an acre prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| when the price comes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| I think people start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| to take note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| I don't know if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| why they're interested now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| say that if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| vote on this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| that knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| home builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| that would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| to purchase this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| we may lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| we have to be okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| If we're okay with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| it's already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| it would be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| it would be a real challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| do what we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| on the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| that we already own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| I would urge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| this land purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| can you hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Yep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| yep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| I know there's been a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| that's been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| but I want to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| a few things and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| if maybe I can try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| to bring a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| of clarity to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| I don't know if I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| bring it to anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Dr. Reiswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| mentioned your tenure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| as superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| and Dr. Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| and your role with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| I'm not hearing a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Is there a response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| I guess my point in that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| that you had to pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| where somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| left off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| I'll say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| we did review the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| we read the feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| and so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| it makes sense that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| last year when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| hearing about land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| you all were presenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| land based upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| the situation that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| were handed at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Dr. Reiswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| but what I'm hearing you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| is now that you're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| this role of leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| you feel like that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| there needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| a deeper look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| looking out a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| and so that's caused you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| to rethink what the ultimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| solution might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Regardless of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| ultimate solution is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| whether it's a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| a primary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| half a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| and half a primary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| it doesn't matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| that solution is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| we know there's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| to be some buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| we're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| have land to stick it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| I don't know the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| I haven't been in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| long enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| but typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| when we purchased land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| has it been because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| we've identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| we need to find land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| for high school and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| then we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| or we need an elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| school so we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| to find land and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| we're going to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| I think one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| confusing things for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| the community in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| situation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Dr. Reiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| what you and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| team are honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| trying to say is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| you actually don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| what you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| but you need to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| where I think what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| community is used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| in the past is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| we need a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| we need an elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| we need a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2688)|

| 0:44:51| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| I would say what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| describing is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| how it happens most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| As we've kind of dug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| into some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Dr. Adams and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| I think it's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| lots of different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| of looking around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| room to people like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| I think it's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| lots of different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| land falls in people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| laps and somebody knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| somebody and that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| so they like to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| I know from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| team's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| when we came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| I applauded Dr. Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| very early on and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| we need to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| facilities assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| We've not done one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| We need to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| building some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| baselines on how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| assess things moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| forward and we took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| that same approach as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| you guys have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| continuous improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| on everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| not just own what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| but think about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| we could do to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| one day we'll be gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| and paying it forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| for the next group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| That's the thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| was already in motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| that we didn't start and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| felt like through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| different things that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| probably didn't answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| the needs for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| community well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| It probably was not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| right price what we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| and probably we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| going to have to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| a whole lot more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| than what was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| part of that and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| shared that with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| I think this is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| $2 million less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| so looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| we do know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| even from reading the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| feasibility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| that we've got to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| cars and families off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| the current property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| We've got to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| people's bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| and have to move them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| into one of the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| be it an elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| be it a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| and that solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| that helps with traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| that helps with kids in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| the hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| that helps get students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| out of portables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| we wouldn't want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| that without obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| the board telling us we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| could go do that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| and second of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| without having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| community's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| they live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| their students go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| school there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| and that's extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| and this one may be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| little different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| what people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| experienced in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| but we're trying to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| a better solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| And is it fair to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| that you're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| be able to solve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| challenge in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| without land of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| that's a great question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| because you could just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| think about renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| but if that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| anything we've seen in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| the numbers and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| we're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| move bodies from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| current spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| I don't know if we as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| board are all in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| but I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| for the community to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| just like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Ryswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| that sometimes this can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| happen in different orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| than maybe what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| I remember in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| the Restoration House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| bought some land and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| had some ideas for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| but the reason why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| bought it right then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| it was prime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| it was in a place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| made sense for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| and actually what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| thought we were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| we ended up doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| something very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| that's actually much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| But the plan changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| but the land was ripe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| and I've read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| I've read the emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| from constituents out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Farragut and from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| teachers and educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| and I want to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| them to stick with us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| the process because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| think there's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| be ample opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| them to give that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| and to be able to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| but without the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| it's really hard to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| I'm not a realtor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| but I do believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| the limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| it probably is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| limited in Farragut in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| terms of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| I don't know if I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| I don't know that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| of my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| how long this land's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| been available or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| it's going to get sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| I think what we've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| is we think it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| work for a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| and because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| and because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| we should look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| regardless of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| somebody else could or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| would or might do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| it or why they haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| done something with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| Dr. Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| I would say too that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| when I received the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| spreadsheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| and appreciate you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| sending that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| and looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| real quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| I did notice that most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| of the comments were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| about a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| and it confused me a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| little bit in the sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| of the way I understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| is that that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| that was a spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| that had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| developed over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| but all the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| were about a middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| but what I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Dr. Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| is that as you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| have continued to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| evaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| that you've not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| looked at land from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| an elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| but you have also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| looked at it from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| middle school perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| and we just happen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| be seeing a column that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| mainly references the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| middle school notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| but maybe there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| probably other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| commentary on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| of these sites earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| when you all were just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| looking at an elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=2953)|

| 1:08:16| six or eight months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| and start talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| that just warps everybody up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| And I've seen it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4105)|

| 1:08:29| seen it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| that's what I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4113)|

| 1:08:50| regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| at the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| I made a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| the other night that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| an elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| And the reason I said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| is actually quite small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| It's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| high-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| original location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| that we were looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| to put an elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| on McPhee Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| would be about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| 3.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| three and a half miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| from this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| you could zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| the same kids that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| have been zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| for that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| could be zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| for an elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| And that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| could be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| whatever type of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| because it's literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| three miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| the place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| with the natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| of the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Hardin Valley area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| which is zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| for Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| of the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Those students are zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| for North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| that's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| that we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| to land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| where we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| for it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| the schools that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| all the portable buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| are Farragut primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| and intermediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| that's the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| and it's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| small area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| It's just not very big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| that's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| to put it in the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| of Farragut because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| then you can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| alleviate the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| that are overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| You asked the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| night about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| do we know that parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| want a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4222)|

| 1:10:28| whatever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| there were some neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| in the west part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| that were actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| the high schoolers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| were zoned for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4236)|

| 1:10:38| of the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4238)|

| 1:16:30| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| that's the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| of our administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| it would be nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| if our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| made it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| to our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| that if they have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| they could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| to speak to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| or local leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| They could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| to district administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| without fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| of a consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| I've been retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| for five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| and I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| to think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| this is no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| It was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| way, way, way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| from the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| but Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| is a huge system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| and it takes a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| to turn a huge ship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| in the ocean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| and there can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| somewhere between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| and where this may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| to employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| that might just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| need to hear it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| As I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| it's the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| from the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| but I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| that there could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| some places in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| where it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| a good reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Many teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| attend many meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| I did when I was teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| and at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| of each meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| we had to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| our meeting norms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Now they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| the same meeting norms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| that we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Wednesday, Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| but we still repeated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| those meeting norms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| and we need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| what the plan was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| it would be inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| to make this emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| to all in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| not that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| to beat that hammer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| every time you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| as a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| but it might not be bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| and other staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| if they have a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| they can bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4676)|

| 1:18:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| I think we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| teacher rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| and I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| just put out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| some protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| that are not there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| for the rest of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| This resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| by some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| For many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| we have been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| and many of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| have talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| in these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| We've been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| that employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| are afraid to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| fill out surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| and even do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| exit interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| because they fear retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Those fears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| can't be assuaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| by simply pointing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| to our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| or pointing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| to whistleblower laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| From personal experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| I know that retaliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| can take many forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| and can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| inflicted at many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| It is my hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| that staff training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| will include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| very clear examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| of unacceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| retaliatory actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| so that all persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4744)|

| 1:19:08| a hostile work environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| will think carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| before using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| their positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4751)|

| 1:19:15| with any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| of retribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4756)|

| 1:19:30| if that may be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| I want to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| many, many levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| of retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| There are many levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| of employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| And retaliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| we usually think of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| as firing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| but it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| something as small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| as being assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| a late bus duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| for an entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| It can be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| like being transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| to a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| that's further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| from your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| It could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| having a schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| rearranged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| so that your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| medical accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| can no longer be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| There are many, many forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| that retaliation can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| And so it's my hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| that this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| can help to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| that that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| something that's acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| that we can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| that very clear communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| is given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| to all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| With that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| it has been suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| that the word insure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| is too strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| and that that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| some legal connotations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| that we may not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| And so I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I very purposefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| included two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| in that paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| I know that's not a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| English teacher thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| But looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| and seeing insure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| in there twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| I made the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| to leave them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| with that guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| from the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| I agree definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| with removing one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| And it's the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| And I would change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| the very last line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| and take out two insure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| and change that to just four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4886)|
