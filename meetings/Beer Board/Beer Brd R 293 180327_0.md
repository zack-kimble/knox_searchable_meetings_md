| 0:01:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| So we're going to go ahead and open it up, and then we'll start off with American Cancer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Start with the A's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| I'm Stacey Clark with the American Cancer Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| Address 871 North Wisegarber Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Sergeant Cowher, no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| Mr. Byrd, file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Motion? I would move that we accept. Second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=146)|
| 0:02:35| When's your event? It is Friday, April 13th in World's Fair Park. Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| Thank you. Citizens Soda Fountain Company. Good evening, I'm Nolan Sherrill with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=161)|
| 0:02:52| Citizens Soda Fountain Company, also known as the Phoenix Pharmacy, 418 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| Okay, it's hard to count. No record. Mr. Burr. We need a copy of the sales tax registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=177)|
| 0:03:04| articles for the LLC, certificate of zoning, and approval from the health department, as well as a server compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=184)|
| 0:03:14| So, Mark, I have all those things, except for the certificate of zoning, and all the inspectors came to visit today and signed off on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=194)|
| 0:03:30| After the meeting, I could take that paperwork. Yeah, absolutely. It's all right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| Because we don't have it in front of us, can you tell us about your server compliance plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| Sure. I have that in front of me, as well. I attended the task course last week, so what that will entail is a 100% ID check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=220)|
| 0:03:50| There's noted forms of identification. What we're really looking for is to do special events in the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=230)|
| 0:03:59| so there will be a wristband for those that are over 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| Really just looking to do beer, maybe some beer floats, along with some ice cream, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| So I've got a 13-page server compliance plan, which includes IDs from the various states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| I borrowed that largely from Kentucky's state plan, and it's consistent with what we were taught in the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=259)|
| 0:04:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Do you want to tell us a little bit about the Phoenix Pharmacy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| Sure. The Phoenix Pharmacy is a working pharmacy on Gay Street. We're also an authentic soda fountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| We have some crossover hours, but largely the soda fountain does most of its business when the pharmacy is closed in the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| We make absolutely everything in-house, tend to collaborate with local chefs on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| We've done beer floats at their places, and we've worked some special events together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| so the idea here is to be able to return the favor so that they can host some events in our space as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| We have quite a few people that want to do private events, such as birthday parties and wedding receptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| and maybe even some campaign events. That's basically what I'm trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| I'm not actually trying to put taps in the shop and sell alcohol on premise during normal business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| That may be part of the consideration, but by and large what I'm looking to do is just increase our flexibility as an event space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=331)|
| 0:05:42| I move to approve a pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| James Cobb, Cobb's Blues Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| Yes, I'm James Cobb, and Cobb Blues Lounge is located on Magnolia 2134.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=360)|
| 0:06:14| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| The file needs a copy of the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning, the server compliance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| as well as approvals from the health department, building inspections, and fire prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=383)|
| 0:06:36| Mr. Cobb, do you have a plan to get your permits taken care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Yes, I've called all three, and they haven't yet given me a date to get back except for the building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=401)|
| 0:06:54| So I did hear from them, so I had to call them back, and he'll come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| But the other two, the food service, I haven't heard from them at all yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| Did you have a call into them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Yes, yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| I called them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| So do you anticipate that you could have everything taken care of in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| Oh, yes, definitely less than that, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| I wanted to ask the same question that Ms. Walsh asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| The plan for server compliance, which is not in the packet, do you have a plan for server compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| We first plan to keep our age limit up, and we've got blues is the basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=462)|
| 0:07:56| That's the reason it's called Cobb Blues Lounge, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| in order to keep the young activity down, and we won't have to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| Serving will be beer and beer only right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| Maybe sometime later on we may go buy a liquor, buy a drink, but right now it will be beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=497)|
| 0:08:25| Yes, sir, there is a requirement that we have a written plan for how you're going to check IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| to make sure everybody is 21 years of age or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| We check everybody at the door as they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| Okay, I'd like a motion to approve pending completion of the additional documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=538)|

| 0:09:58| So Dream Bikes is a nonprofit bicycle shop, and we employ local kids from the Boys and Girls Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| teach them how to work on bikes, run a point-of-sale system, help them get into college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| do scholarships with them for them, job shadowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=609)|

| 0:11:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Oh, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=669)|

| 0:11:11| Okay, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| So just a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| You haven't turned in your server compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Can you elaborate on that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| And when you plan to turn that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| And then if you have any of the other items scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| Yes, the building is under construction right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| We are remodeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| So our inspection is next week, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| So that should take care of the inspection part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| And we are going to use a back office software in which if cashier scans a beer, it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| to promote them to ask for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| So just a visual check by your staff who will be trained and have triggers for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| appropriate dates as they change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=719)|

| 0:12:31| File still needs building inspection and fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| We schedule tomorrow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| Tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=770)|

| 0:12:54| Shop Beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| Never seen so many Islanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| I am Peter Reising with Print Shop Beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| We're located at 1532 Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| On all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Let's see, the majority have less than 5% ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| so there's no background on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Mr. Byron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Of course, this applicant has two different permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| an on-off premise application and a manufactured distributor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| The on-off, we're needing approvals from health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| building inspections, and fire prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Health has approved on the manufacturer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| so that only requires building and fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| What are we looking at first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| On-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| On-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| So what are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| The on-off would require health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| building inspection, and fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Tell us a little bit about what you have planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| I drive by that building every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| so sort of where are you in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| and how long do you think it will take to get these inspections completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| We are probably a few weeks out on final construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| and then the approvals, the permitting would go forth after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| We basically need electrical work, plumbing work, and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| and a few more finishes until we're ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| So in construction language, a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Double it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| I'm contemplating whether or not we approve or have you come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| because it sounds like this could be a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| before you actually have all the inspections done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| It shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| I don't know that I can promise anything, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| Tell us about your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Tell us a little bit about the business, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| So we're going to open a seven-barrel brewery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| and serve beer on-premise and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| And so we'll have seating for people inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| and of course they can take beer away in growlers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| possibly crowlers, and eventually packaged beer as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| all made in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| So if we know that it's going to be a few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| before they're even able to get an inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| I mean, does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Are you looking at me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=939)|

| 0:22:25| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Central Cinema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| I'm Nick Hinker, 1005 Roxbury Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| We had been approved pending documentation of the inspections in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| and that ended up being way ahead of where we ended up in construction funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| Now we are back on track and hope to have inspections done within the next 25, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| So, 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| When was the initial application made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| December 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| So that was the first time you'd come to be a board is when we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| December 19th, yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| So that was, it wasn't applied six months prior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Okay, I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Postpone it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Postpone 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| What did you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Yeah, do you want to do 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| How confident are you about 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| I would be more confident on 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| It's doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Let's begin the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| I'll make a motion to extend it 60 days, not 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1423)|

| 0:23:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Hand tag corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| Hand tag corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| We can, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| It was approved pending final documentation December 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| We can extend it 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| We can extend it 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| What do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| I was just going to share that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| We sent them a certified mail, which was signed for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| and I also left a voicemail, but haven't spoken with Mr. Hanna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| I would move for a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Any nays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Lee Oil Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| So this is an administrative hearing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| My name is Gail Wilder, and I'm the general manager with Lee Oil Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| and it's Lee's Food Mart 15, and it's 5706 Asheville Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| This is just a history of the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| On October 9, 2017, they were cited for sale to a minor, first in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| On October 10, 2017, a remedial plan was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| On February 19, 2018, they were cited again for sale to a minor, a second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| On February 20, a notice of administrative hearing was sent and received by the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| On March 13, 2018, a $500 fine was received, and on March 15, 2018, a revised remedial plan was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1539)|
| 0:25:49| Any comments to that or any additions to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Well, we're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| You know, we don't believe in selling to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| You know, we don't want to sell beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| The manager at the store was the one that done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| and he said he hit the button by a mistake, but that's still no excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| So he has been sent to the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| and I think that this will be a big learning experience for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Most of the time, we terminate the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| but we're going to try to work with him and work with all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| and try to come up with better ways to stop this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Ms. Runner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| I was just really confused by the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| Can you explain what you mean by hitting the wrong button and putting the wrong date in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| I couldn't understand at all whether the buyer was underage or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| Well, evidently the buyer was underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| and evidently he hit the button beside of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| and so evidently he hit the wrong one that the guy above him hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Who put the wrong date in making the person of age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Okay. That was the part I was unclear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Yes. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Okay. So if you put in the correct date for the unaged buyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| the machine or the cash register is going to say cannot make a sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| Yes, and previously, I think it was in October when we had that happen the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| For some reason, the register did take it, but we got all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Like I said, we got the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| We got everything straightened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| We'd never, ever seen that happen before, but we sent everything in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| and at that point in time, that case was supposed to have been cleared up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| but now this time that wasn't the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| He put in the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| So the person working the cash register isn't analyzing the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| The machine is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| So they could be looking at an ID and pay no mind to what the date is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| because you guys don't, I mean, do they not look at a sign that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| anybody before this date is not eligible for purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| Yes. They're supposed to, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| Yes, Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| So my question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| have you done some additional training with your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| to really not be dependent on the machine and putting the date in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| but actually paying attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| because that first step should be you looking at the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| and seeing that the person is underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| and if you identify that on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| you really shouldn't go to step two, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| which is to key the date of birth into the machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Well, that is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| And we have, I mean, each and every one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| we try to explain that to them, and like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| we're doing the very best we can, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| Mr. Frost, tell us what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| There are two options at this point, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| The first one is to accept this person's remedial plan and do nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| and it ends today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| The second option is if you feel that things are inadequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| the subsequent remedial plan is inadequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| the questions that you've asked this person are inadequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| you have the option of referring them on to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| which would be conducted by a beer board hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Much pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Yes, Ms. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| So this may be in the documentation, I'm just missing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| but when was this beer permit issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| What was the original issue date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| How long have they had a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| I don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| I think we've been open at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| We've got 44 stores, so I'm trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| I'm thinking probably maybe three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1796)|
| 0:30:07| It could be less than three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Yes, it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| It could be less than three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| I'm sorry, I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| You use the same system in all 44 stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Yes, which all 44 stores don't sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| We do have some stores in Kentucky and in Virginia that don't sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Much pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Was it the same manager that sold to a miner twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| No, this was actually a new manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| What concerns me is the dependence on the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| and I know I'm reiterating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| but that needs to first be his assessment or her assessment of the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| So I'd like that to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| What's your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| If I could make a motion to accept the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Do nothing is the equivalent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Y'all good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Ma'am, would you wait and see me after the meeting, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180327?start=1888)|
