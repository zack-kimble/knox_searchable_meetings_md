| 0:01:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| Mr. Chairman, they have been sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| Next item is discussion and possible action against beer permittees that are delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| in paying their annual beer privilege tax and or Knox County business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| Clerk 5A, if you'd read into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| MEJ, LLC, Choteau Marina, 12214 Choteau Marina Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| Is someone here from Choteau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| And Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| Mitchell Jones, MEJ Properties, MEJ LLC, 12214 Choteau Marina Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| It's our understanding that you have, in fact, paid the tax that is due and owing the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| but there still is the issue of your county privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Paid back in July of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| The check was mailed back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| I held on to the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| And then again in January, we sent another $100 check to the county for our beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=120)|
| 0:02:08| At that same time, the personal property or tangible property tax was paid for the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=128)|
| 0:02:16| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Madam Clerk, what do your records reflect on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| We did receive the privilege tax check on January the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| And I spoke, left a couple of messages for you, sent it back to you on January the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| because according to our records, the Knox County business tax had not been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| I spoke with you on the 23rd of January, and you said you would be taking care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| Are you Sandra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Hi, Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| I'm good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| You know the record, Sandra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| On the 15th of March, Sharon Jones contacted me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| And I told her, according to the records that we received from the state, still the business tax had not been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| She said she would check on that because it was her understanding that it had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| I then spoke with her again on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| And then a lady from the state, Gail Boring, contacted me that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| And it had, in fact, been paid on January the 25th, but it did not show on the state site that we have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| So why am I here, Sandra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Because your beer privilege tax has still not been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| The $100 check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| And when we did the agenda, it was published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Sandra, I've got the $100 check where you mailed it back to me on the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I would appreciate it if we could allow the clerk to dispense with the matter before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=223)|
| 0:03:55| And I think this man needs to give her a little more courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| What is the bottom line here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Does he owe anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Hi, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Do you owe the $100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Here's my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| So, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Do you have the check currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Wolfie, would you take a look at that and verify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| Ready to go when you're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| All it needs to be filled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Let's execute the check then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| There's really nothing further from a legal standpoint we can take at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Is there any other further actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| So, as he gives the check, then that's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Sandra, do you want me to make this out to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| Not scan the card, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Would you like the one that I sent in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| I have it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Whatever works best for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Mike won't take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Question, Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| So, from the little bit that I gather, it sounds like the check was made on the 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| the state tax was paid on the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| So, it sounds like to me we don't accept beer privilege tax until all other matters are settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| So, we've done nothing wrong, sir, it sounds like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| You said you've made the check out on the 23rd and paid the state tax on the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| I just want to be, I understand you're angry and smug and all that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| but I just want to make sure that we from Knox County haven't done anything to offend you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| So, it sounds like we have not, and all matters will be taken whether you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| I hope your January 23rd check doesn't have a 30-day expiration period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| and if it doesn't, it sounds like we will settle this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| So, I just want to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| Mr. Hammond, may I address Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=347)|
| 0:05:47| Mr. McKenzie, there is no malice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| I've been in this room, not on this subject, a number of times, Mr. Hammond and I have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| as this particular property over the years has gone through growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| What will strike you as interesting is that in October we paid $72,000 in property tax for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| on time and current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| In January, $62,000 in franchise and excise tax to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| In addition, included in that were tangible property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| It's just a little annoying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Sandra has been wonderful to deal with, very pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| So, to take a malice position is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Once we get the $100, we're all clear and good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=408)|

| 0:06:58| Renee Lynn Thompson, Pats Corn Pound, 7715 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Renee Thompson McMurray, 7921 Powell Heights Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| Yes, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| May I ask my understanding that you're going to be surrendering your beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Well, no, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Then I'm just basing the information I've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| I'm going to defer to our beer inspector real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Wolfie, you want to bring us up to date while we're here with these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| The business itself is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| And I think the Knox County codes were out there Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| And so I think I'll defer to codes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| Our code officer, Kim Jarnagan, posted and gave her notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| She has two weeks to remove the motor home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| She cannot live in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| She's living in an on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| And she was given notice Friday, a two-week notice to cease and desist that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=489)|
| 0:08:17| Well, put your name on the record, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| Roy Braden, Knox County Codes, 400 Main Street, Suite 547.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| I guess the question for the commission is why is this on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| What is the violation of codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| No, beyond that, though, I mean, I'm talking about the beer permit, not the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Is the beer permit current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| No, the privilege tax has not been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| So we don't have a current business operating there and the tax has not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| Well, at this juncture, I don't see how this commission can issue a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| or accept monies if we don't even have a viable business and we have a possible code violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| And if you want to, you know, have them come back in 30 days and see if that situation changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| But at this point, I can't see accepting money or issuing any licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| But I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| What's your intention with the property, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Well, in January, actually in December, my husband had a stroke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| We spent over a month and a half at UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| I cannot trust any bartender with that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| I've been stolen from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| We've had a lot of incidents there with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| I mean, I have never been cited for anything, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| I have cleaned that place up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| I mean, I've worked my tail end off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| I've had a bit of outlook, and we just got behind on our bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| I am not living in the motor home, and I stand to correct him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| There has been no mention of my motor home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Yes, it is there on the property because I had did some storage wars for a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| But everything outside the business, I mean, who's going to watch it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| I'm not going to, you know, in and out, in and out every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| It's too much stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| My question was, what's your intention with the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| Are you going to reopen the business or are you going to keep it closed or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| No, I would like to reopen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| I've got an investment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| You know, I don't want to lose that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Well, I think the commission can only do one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| We can allow you to keep your beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| but until you pay the $100 fee, you can't have that beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| We'll feed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| I've been out there twice, and someone was in the motor home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| She actually came out of the door when I was at the front door of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| So there's electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| There's a propane tank hooked up to the motor home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| And I think Coach just said a while ago that they went out and checked it Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| It was livable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| You know, Brad, I'll second a motion if you want to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| My initial intention was to suspend her beer license until she pays $100 and passes codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| It's your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| I just, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| When do you anticipate reopening, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Within a two-week period, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| If possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Wolfie, she was cited for two weeks to respond within two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| I mean, excuse me, Roy Braden, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| Commissioner Kim Jarnagan noticed that someone may be living in the motor home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| so she posted it that they can't do that and gave them two weeks to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| That's the update from Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| I'm sorry, but that is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| I have received no notice about any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| We're not, we're not, that's not something that this beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| I'm going to make a motion that we suspend this for 30 days or until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| If your $100 hasn't been paid, your license will be, I'll recommend it be suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| The motion on the floor is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| So we'll defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Item 5C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Cichy Spot Incorporated, Cichy Spot, 7535 Barnett Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Someone here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Your name and address to the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Robin Dotson, 7535 Barnett Way, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Good afternoon, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| I'm just going to defer to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Did we get verification that they have, in fact, paid all these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Ms. Dotson paid March 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| That being the case, then, again, there would be no further action needed by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| It's up to date, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Item number 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Discussion and possible action against beer permittees who hold a valid beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| but who are no longer in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Kimberlin Heights General Mercantile, 2234 Kimberlin Heights Road, Donald C. Pratt, owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| Is someone here from the Kimberlin Heights Mercantile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Donald Pratt from 2234 Kimberlin Heights Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| Mr. Director, if you don't mind, I want to defer to our beer inspector real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Could you bring the commission up to date as to why we're considering this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Oh, excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| The business has not been open for approximately two years other than a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| Back in the summer, I believe, maybe August for a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| We did it numerous times during the day, evenings, and it has not been opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| I think Mr. Pratt will tell you that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| Mr. Pratt, when was the last time you sold beer out of this establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| July of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| The last time I bought beer was June the 29th of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| I was open, but I wasn't open all the time because I've had problems with my hip and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=855)|
| 0:14:23| Because you can check the Budweiser and see that I had been buying beer and selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=863)|
| 0:14:33| Are you currently open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Right now I just had a double bypass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| I'm not, but I plan on being open between the 6th and the 10th of next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| I'm on a 25-pound weight restriction, and the doctor gave me the go-ahead to start doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=886)|
| 0:14:56| And I paid my privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| All my taxes and stuff are paid up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| And I work by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| I don't have anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| The last time I had somebody there, I lost $1,580 in that one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| And the store was broke in, too, and I lost $7,000 worth of merchandise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| So I don't let anybody work there but me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| Now, I may have to get somebody to help me for the first couple of months part-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| but I usually go in at 9 o'clock, and it depends on the business, to 7, 7.30, 8 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=931)|
| 0:15:44| On Saturdays, I'm there probably until 9 when I'm open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| I do go to the stockyard on Wednesday afternoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| So I am closed on Wednesday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| I do plan on, you know, trying to, you know, to run it because my health now is getting to where I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=958)|
| 0:16:07| Commissioner, what I would suggest, I mean, he is current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| He's paid up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| He's testified under oath that he's going to try to reopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| I think we'll just have the Bureau Inspector monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| If that's not the case, then you can take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| But at this point, I really can't see what action you should or could take, but I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| Mr. Brown, this is 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Mr. Pratt, how long have you had this store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| I opened it in September of 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| Was it open continuously until last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Now, there for seven or eight months, I'd be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| I was open every day, but I wasn't open the whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| You said the last time you bought beer was last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| The last time I bought beer was June the 29th, and I was still selling some beer in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| I had to, my hip went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| I had to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I didn't know I was supposed to call at that time and tell them, you know, why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| So you've been closed effectively since August of last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| Since August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| And then when I got over my hip problems, then I had to go in and have a double bypass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| And I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| We have a second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Wolf, you said how long have you been checking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| This goes back to when U.K. was checking license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| So it's been over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| What is the rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| I think it's just a follow-up on Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| What's the rule that we're up against here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| What is it that has him before us being closed for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| Not having a viable business basically for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1090)|
| 0:18:18| Well, I'm going to make a motion that we defer this or suspend it or whatever for 60 days, Wolfie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1098)|
| 0:18:33| and see if he gets back in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| If he's not back in business in 60 days, then we'll revoke it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| So the motion is to defer it for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| It has been second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| I just have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Are you going to be able to run your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| Are you going to be able to stay open during the 60-day trial period or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| As far as I know, unless something happens to my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| What I mean, though, is that this is acceptable to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Are you saying that I can go ahead and open it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| But you can't sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Oh, he is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| We want him to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| We're giving him 60 days to get reopened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| I misunderstood completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Because if I open between the 6th and the 10th, I will need to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| I misunderstood what Commissioner Brown was proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| So the motion is to defer this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| But in the meantime, he can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| He can operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| You can open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| You can operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| And we'll revisit it in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1183)|

| 0:19:52| Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Thomas Petner, 752 Old Several Pike, Seymour, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| I believe the beer inspector wants to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Or I should say the representative of the sheriff's department or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| Last month I asked for a 30-day to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| I'm asking for 30 more days to finish up my criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Motion has been made to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Another deferral for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Sir, do you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| I would like to just know what I'm under criminal investigation for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Is this the place to discuss that if nothing's been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| There will be no comment from me on what the investigation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| It's deferred for another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| One more comment, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Who can I speak to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Can I speak to the law director in his office to find out what I'm under criminal investigation for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| If you have an attorney, you may want to have your attorney call my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| But beyond that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| I'll have one in contact with you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Application for Brothers Incorporated Time Out Deli and Black Oak Grill 6625 Maynardville Pike on and off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1263)|
| 0:21:12| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Your name and address to the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| My name is Bill Perry, 6625 Maynardville Pike, one of the owners of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| Sir, is it my understanding that you previously obtained two things, one an off-premises license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| and now you have a liquor by the drink license from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| It's not liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| It's actually wine only, but it is an on-premise wine only by the state issue, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| And you're here today because you also want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| We would like an on-premise beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| It says on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| We will surrender the off-premise license if we are granted an on-premise license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| And it is not our intention as a business to become a beer sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| and wine sales will generate less than 10 percent of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| But a lot of our patrons have asked that if it would be possible for us to be able to offer them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| or at least the possibility of purchasing a beer with their meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| So the bottom line is you want an on-premises beer license only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| Mr. Law Director, the ruling now is they have a state liquor license that we must give them a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1350)|
| 0:22:41| But does that also apply to wine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Well, the state regulates, preeminates both wine and liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| But liquor by the drink can be distinguished from wine only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| But, you know, you still have some discretion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| I'll make a motion to approve, but I'll forewarn you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| They're going to check you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Motion has been made and seconded to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Do we need to hear from the different departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Sir, you need to speak with the blonde lady that was sitting in front of you before you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| She has a gift for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1415)|

| 0:24:10| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1451)|

| 0:24:15| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| And if no one disagrees, I'd like to do the honorary resolution first with regards to the honoring the women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| who have served on county commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| So, clerk, if you would read Resolution R-12-3-101 into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| honoring the women who have served on the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| This is to be added, so it is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Commissioner Burrell, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Can I have the clerk read this into the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Whereas the United States Congress passed House Resolution 1174,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| a resolution supporting National Women's History Month in an effort to recognize and honor the women in organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| in the United States that have fought and continue to promote the teaching of women's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| And whereas the purpose of National Women's History Month is to increase awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| and knowledge of women's involvement in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| And whereas as recently as 1970s, women's history was rarely included in the kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| through grade 12 curriculum and was not part of the public awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| And whereas the United States boasts a rich history of women whose vast and courageous achievements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| speak to the sense of excellence and potential shared by all Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| And whereas American women of every race, class, and ethnic background have made historic contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| to the growth and strength of our nation in countless recorded and unrecorded ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| especially in the areas of social and political change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| And whereas several women in Knox County have made history by serving with distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| as members of Knox County Commission, namely current Knox County Mayor Madeline Rojero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| Bita Sam, Mary Lou Horner, Wanda Moody, Pat Medley, Diane Jordan, Michelle Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| Victoria DeFreeze, Elaine Davis, and Sharon Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| And whereas it is only fitting that Knox County recognize these women for their pioneer spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| and service to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| The commission of Knox County hereby honors all women who have served on the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| and further expresses their appreciation for their commitment, service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| and contributions in making our community a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Be it further resolved that if any notifications are to be made to effectuate this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| then the county clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of the resolution to the proper authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| and after its passage as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| The motion that we made was to put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| So we need to have another motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| It is done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| So, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Unfortunately, Madeline is upstairs doing budget hearings today, so she wasn't able to run down for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| And some of the other female commissioners weren't able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| But I thought this was an appropriate time to do this since this is Women's History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| And there have only been 11 women who have served on county commission in the entire history of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| which is not very many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| And these women are the ones who paved the way for my service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| So I am in their debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| And they are examples for me for my public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| So I'm grateful to have them here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| And I'm going to give them each an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| And then we're all going to go out in the hallway and have a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| But I want to thank them all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| I just want to say thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| This is definitely an honor for you all to recognize our service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| I want to thank Amy for having such foresight in doing this for the female commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| because we served the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| We enjoyed serving the people and being part of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| Good afternoon, commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| I'm Sharon Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| And I am very delighted to be here and an honor to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| And thank you very much, Amy, for recognizing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| And I was blown away to hear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| I appreciate the honor and the recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| You know, I have to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| I just want to say I served with all of you that are up here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| So what a joy it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| And I want to thank Amy for recognizing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| And it is certainly an honor to represent the people and to make Knox County a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| And no one realizes what you all go through until you've been sitting in that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| And it is not an easy seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| So I want to just applaud you all and for the new commission and how you all seem to be working things through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| And what a joy and privilege it was to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| So best of luck to all of you with all your decisions and all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| And thank you again, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Mr. Chairman, I just want to say I served with every one of these ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| And I really enjoyed working with you ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| And I had the privilege of serving with each of you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| And so thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| And we appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| And I thought you were supposed to leave that hat in the first district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| and the commissioner is supposed to continue wearing that hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| My hair is way too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1811)|
| 0:30:26| Commissioners, our public forum, this portion of our public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| was designed for individuals who wanted to address us that on items that were not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| We have nine individuals who have signed up to speak with regards to the TVA tree cutting policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| And unless I hear an objection, I'd like to wait and hear those when we hear that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| We do have two people who have signed up to speak on items that are not on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| So we'd like to recognize you at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Paul Johnson, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Yes, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| If you'd like to address commission, you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| And if you'll give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| It's Paul Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Address is 2203 Covered Bridge Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| And that's 37932 if you need the zip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| I appreciate you letting me come to speak with you this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| I appreciate the rapid response that you allowed us to come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| The issue that we have, and I'm representing today several residents that are with me in the Hardin Valley community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| off of Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| And I also have a handout for each one of you, if you don't mind me handing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1892)|
| 0:31:52| But our concern is the heavy truck traffic coming down Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| I've been a resident in the area for about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| But during most of the day and even in the middle of the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| if you look on the map that we have here, we've got heavy trucks coming down through Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| The yellow line describes the route they are taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| They come off of Watt Road there and down through Hickory Creek on to Hardin Valley Road and back up to Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1943)|
| 0:32:32| There's, especially in the Hickory Creek Road area, it's a very residential section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| If you look on there, I've marked where the soccer field is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| There's actually no commercial businesses on Hickory Creek whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| And even on a morning, I mean, it'll nearly be like a convoy coming through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| And one of the reasons we think that they are coming that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| because many times, like I say, I've even followed the truck traffic going down Hickory Creek Road and down to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| They'll turn right on Pellissippi and go back to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| So it appears that many of the trucks coming through that route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| are just coming that route to avoid the way stations on both sides of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| And what we would like to do is have a gross weight limit of 10,000 pounds or less on trucks coming through that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=1998)|
| 0:33:31| as they do across the interstate on Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| I have a neighbor with me, Steve Murray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| and he actually even has some pictures of some trucks coming through our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| that might be helpful to you to visualize what we're seeing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you for letting me talk for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| What it is, there's a bulk of materials at Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| I'll skip through a lot of this, but the city of Farragut handled it by posting a 10,000-pound sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| which I have pictures of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| I've only brought one for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| But keeping in mind that there's a rock quarry at Watt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| and at Watt Road, there's that big intersection there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| and they're supposed to go left out of the rock quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| which when they go right, they take a country road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| which passes through a soccer field, all-residential road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| which is Hickory Creek, which then turns into Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| which goes past two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| And, you know, ultimately, they're avoiding all the traffic of the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| and also avoiding the way scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| It is a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| There is actually bikers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| I've got pictures of bikers riding down the road, and lots of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| Lots of pictures, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| There's a biker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| There's a truck going down the road, an 18-wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Actually, this is kind of a funny story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I was out taking a picture of a semi-truck driving by off my back patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| as you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| He decides to slam on his brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| You see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| See the mud flaps on his truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| He hit it so hard that they were touching the backs of his tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| He proceeded to get out of his truck and threaten me and call me a rich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| you know, I won't use the bad word he used, for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| I have nothing better to do, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| That's another picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| So, you know, all I'm looking for is the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| You know, these 18-wheelers are driving down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| Here's a FedEx semi-truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| I don't know what delivery he would have on our tiny little road out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2149)|
| 0:36:02| And here's actually the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| It's called Vulcan Material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| Here's a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| And, again, I've done enough research to ultimately come up to this conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| for the city and the mayor of Fairgate, what he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| because it is an ongoing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| So they posted a sign right above the truck stop there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| which would be the, and I think I've already passed that picture up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| but there's a truck stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| And right at the, pass that one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| They posted a sign, welcome to Fairgate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Twenty feet beyond that, it says no trucks beyond 10,000 pounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| because at that point, once that sign has been posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| they have no, those truckers can be pulled over and cited for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| being on a road that they have no business on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| I don't feel like if they're going down that road to make a delivery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| maybe that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| But to avoid the weigh scales and, you know, tear up the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| because their trucks are overweight to the tune of 100,000 pounds in some situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| You know, these trucks have three and four axles, boosters, and all the goodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| I can go on more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| But, like I said, we don't want to waste too much of your precious time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| So, basically, what you're asking us to do is consider a 10,000-pound limit on that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| And there's a couple places it can be placed, but, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| Mr. Vandivate, is it possible for you to look into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| and report back to us next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Have you been in contact with these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| I'm not acquainted with these two gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| but we are familiar with the situation at Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| And, ironically enough, I actually was dealing with one this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| on the opposite end of the county in Commissioner Wright's district on East End Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| So, it's a persistent and pervasive problem across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| State law uses a standard of 80,000 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| And so, obviously, one of the things that we would need to do in this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| is perhaps sit down with a member of Mr. Jarrett's staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| and determine if we have local authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| perhaps for a commission to adopt a resolution or ordinance that would lower that weight limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| And, certainly, that's something I think we'd be interested in doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| This is one of those cases where we'd like to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| but we haven't had good options up until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| So, it may be that perhaps some subsequent meeting with some of these homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| and a member of Mr. Jarrett's staff might make a logical next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| If you could meet with these individuals, meet with Mr. Jarrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| and then let us know what our options might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| No, I was just going to kind of touch on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Me and Dwight have already been in discussion about Hickory Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| and discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| And I actually called THP to come out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| and to take a look at the commercial vehicle side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| And so, it's been looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| I don't know how much resources have been put in on the THP side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| but I think we've already had the discussions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| I've returned several on the Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| So, is that acceptable to you, gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| to begin discussion with Mr. VandeVate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| and then we'll see where they go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| And I've got the original petition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| If I need to give that to anybody, there's about 60 names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| I made you copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| If you want to we have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Is copy okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Yeah, copy's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| We have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| It'll go into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Next, we have Mary Kay Sullivan, who has asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Ms. Sullivan, if you'd give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Mary Kay Sullivan, 1039 Scenic Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| When I signed up, I asked for 60 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| and I'm going to try to stick to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| So, start your timers, and we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| I'm here to speak in favor of Knox County Schools' budget for fiscal 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| As a college teacher, I have been all too aware of how woefully unprepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| some entering students are in the freshman class in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| This clearly puts them at a tremendous disadvantage for college success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| and also at a disadvantage for employment opportunities in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| something that clearly concerns all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| Also, as a teacher of finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| I'm impressed with how investments, solid investments today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| can yield significant rewards in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| And we talk about human capital and finance, in this case, our young people, our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| So, I'm impressed with the 2013 budget in the way that it, in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| with the technology aspect, in addition to the other aspects covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| can help position our students for greater success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| And I think represents a significant investment in our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| I think my time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| I'll be back at a later date to talk with you again for one minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| about funding possibilities for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| So, thank you for your concern and for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Next, we have Paul, is it, DeLeon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| DeLeon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| And if you'd give us your address, and you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| I'm at 630 Watauga, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| I, too, just wanted to touch on the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| that you'll be considering in the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| As a homeowner, I appreciate very much your careful stewardship for our tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| But I also know that better schools are going to make my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| and my town a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| We can help our young folks become more engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| skilled, self-reliant, responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| And, in turn, that's going to keep the costs down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| on social services and law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| So, I'm willing to pay my share of the costs for great schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| because I know I'll benefit from it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| So, thanks in advance for all your hard work on the county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| The individuals who have signed up to speak on tree cutting in K-Town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=2531)|

| 0:54:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| We have an individual who has asked to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| And I believe that Mr. Napier would want to address it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| Mr. Napier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Oh, he's here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| You know, maybe the best way to start this off is to have Mr. Napier or someone explain to us exactly what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3254)|
| 0:54:22| pilot is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| I know there's a lot of misunderstanding about whether we're giving money to a private company to encourage them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| And there may be some members on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| I think we've had a couple of meetings explaining those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| I think the best way to refresh all of our memories and then also so everyone out here can hear it is just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| briefly tell us what a pilot is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| Could you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| My name is Todd Napier, and I'm at 17 Market Square in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| And I'm here on behalf of the Industrial Development Board of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| So in a pilot, in this case, it's typically used as an incentive to make something happen that would not otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3294)|
| 0:55:02| happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| And that goes on with trying to recruit new companies to even in downtown development for a development project that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| would not otherwise happen, or to help incent expansions of existing companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| So under state law, an industrial development board, they can hold real and personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| And while they hold it, it becomes tax exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| And in generally in cases like if you – I'm just going to give an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| I took an old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| It's on the tax rolls at, you know, $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| It was improved, and it would be on at $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| So during that time, the $40,000 would not be collected because it was never being collected before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| And at the point that it goes back on the rolls, that full amount then comes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| In the case of this case where we're talking about a pilot trying to recruit a brand-new company to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| get a piece of property that's not producing any taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| There's an opportunity to recruit a company to Knox County that would be producing significant taxes over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| from employee – having employees, employee spending, company spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| And then, obviously, when you develop a piece of property and have a facility on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| then it has real value and personal property that becomes taxable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| What you're being asked to do is say, well, in exchange for coming and creating jobs and employee spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3383)|
| 0:56:31| we're willing to not collect the taxes that we're not collecting already during that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| In this case, four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| But during that time, there is tax generated from, as I said, having employees at facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| and the company spending money as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| So, and then at the end of that pilot period, the IDB then transfers the property back over to the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| and then everything goes back on to the tax rolls just as it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| And typically, these are just – these are done for projects that would not otherwise happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| So, I don't hope that explained it well enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| So, it's not taxes that, you know, a misconception is that we're going into the treasury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| and we're taking money out and we're handing out money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| That is absolutely not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| What we're doing is trying to incent a project that would not otherwise happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| on a piece of property that is not currently producing taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| and we're willing just to forgo those for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| And in this case, the request is for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Todd, is this tied to this particular piece of property or is it tied to the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| The way the resolution is written today, it is not tied to a particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| I would say this, that this is the only site in Knox County that the company is deemed as viable that works for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3476)|
| 0:58:08| We have someone who's signed up to speak, Mr. Bob Wolfenbarger, if you'd like to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| And if you'd give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| And you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Bob Wolfenbarger, 8416 Kodak Road, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| I'm pleased to hear that this pilot is not tied to the property because we, as a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3505)|
| 0:58:34| would hope that we could use our resources to entice Ketom to locate in a more desirable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3514)|
| 0:58:43| If I may, I want to read our thoughts on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| With regard to the proposed pilot, the community does not believe the TDC should be proposing a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| that is tied to Midway Road property while the property is involved in litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| which is very likely to continue in the foreseeable future as long as the TDC pursues sector plan and zoning changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| While we do believe that Ketom is a desirable business for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| we believe TDC should be very aggressively using its expertise and its incentives to entice Ketom to locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3550)|
| 0:59:18| at a site where we will be more likely to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| a site that is suitable with the types of businesses where the location is not mired in controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| Respectfully, a site that ensures that some of the individual jobs, immediate jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| and most of the future jobs will be Knox County residents and taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| instead of jobs for the people who live in Jefferson, Sevier, and Hamblin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| With the ongoing legal challenges and the other issues as they relate to the proposed Midway Road site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| it is unlikely that Ketom can move forward in a timely manner at the Midway Road site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| In a new Sentinel article about this project, the plaintiff's attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| in the original lawsuit, made it clear that we will continue to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| This is just setting up everyone, Ketom, Knox County, and TDC, up for failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3601)|
| 1:00:09| Why shouldn't the TDC and Knox County make Ketom an exceptionally persuasive offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| to locate at the I-275 business park next to Cisco Distribution Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| or in the Forks of the River Industrial Park near the Green Mountain Coffee Facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| Giving them some property in East Bridge or any other number of locations that the TDC controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| they could make Ketom a tremendous deal if they would consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| We believe the Midway community in all Knox Counties deserve a cohesive and comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3636)|
| 1:00:44| and thoughtful plan for the development around Midway Road interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| It is the last undeveloped interstate exit in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| the gateway to Knox County, and we should do something extraordinary with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| Something that won't pollute the groundwater in the wells or the surrounding property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| won't pollute the French Broad River where we derive Knoxville's drinking supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| We don't just want another interstate interchange with a hodgepodge of businesses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| Recently, as you all know, Major Birch had Gloria Ray form a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| to brainstorm concepts for the Midway Road property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| and evidently it has been disbanded since she stepped down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| We had been working on some existing concepts with folks from ORNL, TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3687)|
| 1:01:35| and other business leaders from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| and that would make Midway truly an economic development engine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| It would be a shame to see that work disregarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| I hope we can reengage and everyone restart that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| I appreciate the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| I was going to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| We've heard a lot about this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I believe it's been out there since about 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| And who's supporting it and who's not supporting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| I'll be perfectly honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| I think a lot of us weren't sitting on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| I don't even know what the lawsuit's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Could someone explain that to us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| And what the, you know, first of all, what it's about and if the ruling goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| since I don't know what it's about, if the ruling goes in one direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| could you tell us what implications that has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| And if the ruling goes in another direction, what implication that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| and what potential complications could we run into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Well, you know, in a nutshell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| the commission was looking at the rezoning of that Midway property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| The lawsuit was filed and essentially there was a challenge to the validity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| the rezoning of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Now, in 2008, the chancellor essentially agreed that there was a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| What you really have before the court now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| since that time, the commission basically expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| its desire to go back to the original land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| in other words, to its pre-2006 status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| So that plan does not include a business park or industrial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| for Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| So let's say, for instance, the court at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| and again, this is a long-going, complicated lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| It's tough to do it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| But if the court rules for the plaintiff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| and since the county commission showed ultimately a desire to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| to the 2006 plan, that makes us basically in line with the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| the plaintiff would seek would be the validity of that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| Then you would basically have a piece of property that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| the zoning would be agricultural and the land use would be low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| residential and office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| That's essentially if the court agrees with the plaintiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| Now, if that's the case, anyone who wants to develop out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| is going to have to do a plan amendment, seek a change in zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| and submit a development plan to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| So does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| So essentially what you're looking at is going back several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| to the way it originally was, which again is zoning and agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| with the land use plan or use being low-density residential and office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| So to change that, let's say an entity, if the court rules that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| for someone to develop out there any kind of industrial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| they're going to have to ask probably for business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| And again, go through that three-step process through MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| plan amendment, change in zoning, development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| So if we grant this pilot and then they come back for a zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| to build this headquarters there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| and then the ruling comes down on the side of the plaintiffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| what would be the repercussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Well, if it comes down on the plaintiff, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| if it comes down in favor of the plaintiffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| that means the property will be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| You'll have an agricultural zoning and a land use plan of low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| and office, which means the person who wants to develop that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| merely by granting a pilot, you're not doing anything to affect the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| They would have to go before MPC and achieve a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| a change in the zoning, and a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| And that would ultimately come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| What I'm asking is if we ñ my understanding is that they want to move quickly on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3943)|
| 1:05:50| So chances are they're going to be coming to us before this finishes up in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3950)|
| 1:05:59| So at that point, if this commission grants what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| and they go ahead and build out there before this finishes up in the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| and at that point the courts come down on the side of the plaintiff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| are there any repercussions at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| I mean, if the court comes down and says the zoning for this is agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| and the land use is low-density residential and office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| and they achieve a plan amendment, a change in zoning, and a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| they get to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| Todd, I have a couple of questions I'd like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| How much is the pilot that we're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Is it $198,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| So it's a forgoance of four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| And based on their projected capital investment in phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| that's the value that it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Obviously, if they're investing more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| then it would be more if their investment is slightly less than the value of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| It's just the value of their investment for four years' worth of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| And that's what we estimate it at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| I want to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| And I wanted to make sure I have my figures correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| And the reason I want to speak in favor of this is I want us to look at the numbers first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| $198,000 is the pilot that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| Let's look at the amount of investment that they're wanting to put into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| They're wanting to build a building of $7.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| purchase equipment for $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| Now, that's, what, about $12 million right there that they're wanting to invest in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| If I go to a car lot and I say that I want a Mustang GT convertible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| and the salesperson looks at me and says, no, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| You want another convertible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| I've got another car here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| And I say, no, I want a Mustang GT convertible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| And they say, no, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Go over here and look at this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Well, I might go over and look at it, but that's not what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| And so I'm going to go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| These folks can go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| They do not have to come to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| They can easily go to Sevier County, which is willing to welcome them with open arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| They are willing to go to another county adjacent to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| that are willing to embrace them with open arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| because they want them to spend that $12 million to $13 million in investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| Now, let's look at jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| And if you don't think jobs are important, ask somebody who doesn't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| I am now one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| And so you look at year number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| They're going to employ, and these are rough numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| It could be more, it could be less, 80 people with wages of $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4113)|
| 1:08:42| Now, that's just year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| You multiply that out to year number five, and it grows each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| because this company wants to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| That's why they want to come to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| They want to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| They want to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| The taxes that we will be the beneficiary of in terms of sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| but also in jobs and in equipment purchases and et cetera, is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| Now, they do not have to come to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| They want to come to Knox County if we welcome them and if we want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| But if we say, no, we don't want you, then they'll go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| They'll take those jobs and that $3.5 million payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| and put it in Sevier County, which is willing to welcome them with open arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| I say let's welcome them and let's give them this pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| and let's give them the opportunity to come and grow and expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| and help us with our economic base as opposed to going somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| So, I will be voting in favor of this, and those are the reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| Commissioner Burroughs, did you want to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Commissioner Briggs, your lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| I want to recognize each of you if you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| I'm happy to support this pilot because it's not tied to this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| There are a lot of variables for me to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| This is a company that I'm impressed with, that I would support, that I want in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4197)|
| 1:10:05| I actually would love to have them in my own district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| But I am very opposed to greenfield development unless there are some really spectacular things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4209)|
| 1:10:16| that are part of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| It's a woman-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| It employs a lot of women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Those are great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| But it's going to take more than that for me to support greenfield development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| So, I've unfortunately not had the opportunity to sit down with Patricia Bobley yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| We've played phone tag, and we spoke for the first time earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| So, I look forward to sitting down and talking with her some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| But I want to make it clear, I support this pilot because I want them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| But if it comes down to rezoning the way it is right now, that does not have my support yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| So, I do want them here, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| But I don't see enough yet to overcome my aversion to greenfield development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| So, I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Do we have a motion on the floor yet on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| We do have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| It's to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Commissioner Hayman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| I just want to make a point, just so I don't want to be deceiving at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| that there's a whereas TB Properties has submitted to the corporation an application for tax incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| under the tax incentive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| Now, the application they made to us was specific to that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| So, I just don't want to at all be, you know, deceiving about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| I mean, this is the site that they're going, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| this is the only site that we're aware of and they've told us they're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| So, I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Thanks, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| I certainly don't want to be, you know, confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| Oh, I think there's someone else who would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| Mr. Chair, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Thank you, Commissioner Burroughs and Chairman Hayman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| My name is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| I live at 6233 Babley Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| I certainly would like for everybody to understand that, like Ms. Burroughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| we do support the pilot if it is not tied to a specific piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| I think that we would welcome that business to come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| but our concern is that maybe Ms. Bible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| and K-Tom doesn't really understand the history of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| and they don't understand the will of the people out there who are planning to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| They're going to continue to fight if this kind of rezoning goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4362)|
| 1:12:50| And so, you know, I certainly think that we should do everything that we can to try to encourage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4370)|
| 1:12:59| to locate on an appropriate site, and the community will be more than willing to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| But, you know, just as the new Sentinel said, the plaintiff's attorney, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| says that the lawsuit is not concluded on the property existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| And furthermore, that if TDC attempts to continue to rezone that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| that they will amend the lawsuit or file another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| So just don't want to set them up for failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| I believe that we do have some places where we could offer them a really, really sweet deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4411)|
| 1:13:39| and that's something that we should be considering to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| I appreciate the analogy of the convertible and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| but perhaps, you know, a gigantic price break would change their mind about that convertible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| And I just wonder if that kind of thing, that kind of approach has been, you know, put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| I'd like to offer a substitute motion that we approve this pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| but not have it tied to that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| Substitute motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| I'll second for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Let me just, I'll let Amy talk about this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| I just wanted to offer an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| I can't vote for this if it's tied to this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| As much as I want KTOM here and as much as I would like to work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| I have not seen enough to overcome the hesitations I have about greenfield development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4492)|
| 1:15:00| and particularly about this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| especially with regards to the lawsuit that's underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| and what this commission just recently decided in terms of what we said we wanted to happen at Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4507)|
| 1:15:16| So I think I definitely want them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| I would like a little more time to meet with Ms. Bible and talk through some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4521)|
| 1:15:29| If it remains tied to this particular piece of property, it's not something I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| So that's why I'm asking for a substitute motion so that the pilot is still available to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| but it's not dependent on this particular piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| And that way I can support it wholeheartedly and see where I can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| And I agree with the Chair about if you just look at the numbers about employment and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4552)|
| 1:16:00| those are some pretty impressive things that are hard to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| I guess, first of all, I would like for Todd to respond to some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| that Mr. Wolfenbarger and Ms. Starbuck have brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| So would you do that, Todd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| So specifically, like, when they bring up the notion that I-275 and Forks of the River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4578)|
| 1:16:26| and East Bridge and so on, these are unacceptable sites apparently to KTOM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| And so tell us about that and why so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| And Ms. Bibles here, if you've got questions about it, I mean, she's been pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| They've looked at a lot of sites up and down the I-81, I-40 corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| This is the only site in Knox County that works for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| And one of the big reasons is a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| One of them is part of their branding strategy for growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| continuing to grow their company has to do with visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| There's 95,000 cars a day on average that travel up and down I-40 in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| So interstate, being on the interstate is a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| The other thing is that it's just been mentioned or if it hasn't been mentioned today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| it's been mentioned many times in the paper that this company is currently located in Russellville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| which is on the outskirts of Morristown or next to Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| They have 63 employees, not all of which live in Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| But that's the center of their existing employee base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| So any company that's looking to make a relocation is built around employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| and existing employees you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| So they can't move so far away that they will lose all their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| You know, she's very appreciative of the work that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| And this would allow them or the bulk of them to be able to stay with the company and continue to grow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| But being closer to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| so it's kind of this balance between where you're at now but getting closer to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| and being able to draw on a much larger labor shed, labor pool that we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| and the skill bases that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| So those are and then proximity to an interstate interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| So those are the things that have kind of said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| this is as far west as we can go and still achieve those and be on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| A couple of other contentions there are, well, one main one, of course, is the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4707)|
| 1:18:34| and how the lawsuit functions right now in terms of their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| So can you give me some contingencies about the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| and this thing going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| I will speak to it as much as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| And I will not speak anymore because I'm not our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| But here's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| The lawsuit is over the 2006 application for rezoning, whether it was valid or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| whether it was properly done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| There is a new application, not by us, but by the company on TB Properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| that would be developing the property and owning it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| that is a separate application and they're not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| And I think Law Director Jarrett said that the application that they would be filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4756)|
| 1:19:25| would be separate from that if I understood him correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| A contention might be that the lawsuit and our action on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4771)|
| 1:19:40| could have some influence on the suit's process and rather, you know, it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| I mean, if we change this site, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| we change this interchange by what we do from what its current zoning is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| what its current land use plan is, and we change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| then that changes the way the judge might look at what we wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| So, I mean, to me it seems reasonable to wait for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| We're talking about an area that we've fought over for years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4813)|
| 1:20:21| and for the lawsuit not to be heard and for us to hear the judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| The judgment that comes from it seems a little bit premature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| and we're pushing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| The other contention or one other suggestion that was made, Todd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| was about the effort to get a comprehensive plan that applied to Midway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4838)|
| 1:20:48| as was an effort there before and sort of that committee's been disbanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| So, while you all were watching that process carefully, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| did any of the ideas, any of the framework that came from that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4858)|
| 1:21:07| strike you as valid or credible as we go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| I just wanted an opinion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| I was in attendance, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| I was able to make two of the three meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| I was at a commission meeting, actually, during one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| You know, we started down that process and Ms. Ray was leading that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| And, you know, I don't know if people had a difference of opinions at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| So, I don't think what this is today, short of some suggestions that the whole thing be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4894)|
| 1:21:42| some kind of agricultural reserve, certainly this would be different from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| I don't believe there was ever a resolution that came out of that meeting that would prevent you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| from being able to make a decision on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| This lawsuit, the elephant in the room, predates most of us up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| But my understanding was that when it was supposedly settled, it, in effect, put back the zonings as it was in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4930)|
| 1:22:22| If so, does that not end the case, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| What is still pending that we're dancing about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| I don't understand what could still be pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| We have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| If it goes through MPC, they get their application for zoning and their plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| It comes to us to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| And once we vote on it, that's the new zoning, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| You have the ultimate authority to do that, regardless of the outcome of the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| Why are we dancing around something that's pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| We're doing what's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| You know, I wasn't going to say anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| but I think I'm going to make a comment is that we've got 11 experts here sitting around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| that seem to really know the restaurant distribution business really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| We know the best place to put the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| We know what the best business plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| We know how to tell people how to run their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| We know how to tell them not only who to hire, how many to hire, and where they're going to hire them from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| I don't think this makes any sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| I think this lady and her business, they know how to run their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| They know where they want their business to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| Their business plan calls for them to be on an interstate highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| They're offering to bring jobs here to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| I think for those of us that have jobs and have work, we're forgetting about people who don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| And at some point, you know, we have to think about people who don't have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| We can say, well, let's put it out there in Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| and let people run up and down the highway every day, you know, polluting the air and buying $4 gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| We did it to Hackney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| We ran Hackney out of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| It's probably many of the same people that are working for Hackney right now are still living, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| down here in the area out around east Knox County and in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| The only thing we did is rather than driving five miles a day, they're driving 30 miles a day at $4 a gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| And to me, this is, you know, as that commercial on the radio says, this is the biggest no-brainer that the world ever saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| I mean, you know, every politician in the country, except for Knox County, is running on a program of bringing jobs to their state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| We're running on programs of doing what we can to run them out of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| I mean, you know, people stand back and look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| You know, I have people ask me out where I live, I say, have you guys lost your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| And I think the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| I mean, this is a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I mean, this is a company that's we talk about less support minorities, less support women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| less support single women that have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| I mean, this is what we heard last week or last month about who she was hiring in her garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| single women that had no way to support their families other than with a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| And we're sitting here saying, you know, we're not only we don't really want you, but if you want to come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| we're going to tell you how to do your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| I mean, this makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| I think this company has enough sense to know what the legal ramifications are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| They know what's in the works out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| They don't come into this thing blindly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| That's why they're successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| And if they're willing to take the risk, at least we could do this all from a place to, you know, to take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| I mean, I think we need to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| We need to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| We not only need to vote yes, we need to say thank you for considering us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| Thank you for putting up with all of this that you're having to put up with down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| From my standpoint and for the people that live out in my district, we really would like to have you here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| We want to welcome you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| I hope you hire a lot of people that don't have jobs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| I hope you continue to hire a lot of single women that are trying to support their children who don't have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| Because I think somebody has to think about those folks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| I don't think anybody is attempting to tell this woman how to run her business or how to do her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5167)|
| 1:26:15| I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| I would like to know if there's somebody here from the mayor's office who can speak to what happened to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5179)|
| 1:26:27| that was put together that was supposed to be working on developing alternative ideas for the Midway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5187)|
| 1:26:37| I believe Mr. Rice is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| He's making his way to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| Dean, thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| If you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Dean Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| It's 925 Mid-South Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| In terms of it was not a report given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| you may remember that the individual who volunteered to chair that committee was a lady by the name of Gloria Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| And she is not engaged in that activity at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| So, is the mayor's office going to just let that initiative die?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| But it doesn't have anything to present to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| So, can you tell me what the next steps are for that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| Well, to look at who's leading that committee, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| and to move forward in trying to find and bring the various stakeholders together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| I don't know that that relates directly to the question at hand here, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| Well, I think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Because that's one of the things that they're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| is come up with what they think is going to be the best fit for that area with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| So, I think it does actually have bearing on what we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| So, that's why I was asking if you had any updates on where you were with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| if it was being allowed to just disappear, or if you were actually ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| No, it's not being allowed to disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| But I have nothing to give to you today to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| So, do you have some people in mind to ask to step up and lead this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| I can't speak for the mayor on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| Also, Todd, you had mentioned that they had looked at property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| You had mentioned the I-40 and I-81, but you hadn't mentioned 275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| And I know you had told me that you had actually spoke to the developer about property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| On 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| But, yeah, their target area of sites that they were willing to consider was on I-81 and I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5295)|
| 1:28:23| So, you've not actually shown them anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| Do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| Does anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| I'll speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| They've asked to see a certain area of the town, and we showed it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| And we can't mark it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| You know, if you work with the chamber on any level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| you know the economic development office pushes private and publicly held land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| And I've got Westbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| It's got publicly held land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| It's got privately held land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| I've been to three or four businesses that have come to look at privately held companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| and our publicly held land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| They set the parameters of the search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| And if she says that I want to be on the east end of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| that's as far east as I want to go to help keep as many employees as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| then that's what we need to show her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| I mean, I don't know why that, you know, 275 corridor is a great corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| and I wish the railroad would release that area besides Cisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| That's a wonderful area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| And behind it, Office Central is a great area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| But if they don't want to go there, they don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| I don't know why it's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| I don't know why that issue is that hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| Actually, that issue isn't quite particularly that hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| But what I'm having trouble with is what this commission just did with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| what we just said we wanted with this particular piece of property I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| And I do want this business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| This is why I have raised so many questions about this instead of just opposing it outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| I want this business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| But I also, you know, I represent the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| And what this community wants is just as important to me as bringing new businesses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5400)|
| 1:30:08| Those are the people that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| And those are the people that I'm listening to on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| I don't think they should be completely cut out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| So I have been interested in trying to find a way that this can work for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| I understand that not all of you appreciate my efforts or my thoughts along that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5423)|
| 1:30:30| But this is something that is very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| You know, sometimes our efforts and our thoughts are overpowering what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| I mean, I'd like to have them to Halls, but you don't send me over here crying saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| hey, come to Halls, come to Fountain City, come to Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| It's her $6.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| And unless you've got $6.5 million in your pocket, I'm like Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| Patricia, thank you very much for considering Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| Patricia, could you come up real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5472)|
| 1:31:20| You know, Patricia, I was thinking today, this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| I was halfway thinking about having you leave the room while we discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| because I didn't want you to see what was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| and how that we act on some of this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| But, Dr. Briggs, I appreciate what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| I'm in agreement with a lot of what you said and, Mr. Chairman Hammond, how you utilized it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| Do you understand the timeline, Patricia, that you're up against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| And does that still work with your timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| Yes, sir, I do, if it isn't continual to be put off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| I've been given a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| And I would like to address a concern that Commissioner Burroughs has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| In fact, directly speaking with you, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| and thank you so much to each of you for taking my calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| or some of you for even meeting me at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| I'm so appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| But before I came here, I walked into a high-level meeting of my key people that run the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| and just an amazing group of young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| And I'm the old horse in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| And lots of times they look at me like, oh, my gosh, we have to listen to her again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| And today, particularly, we were trying to decide the structure of how the company was going to report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5551)|
| 1:32:39| And there were 12 people, 12 very powerful people in the room, and they all had their ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| and they were all real targeted and real focused and they all had beautiful things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| And at the end, there was one that kept belaggering and saying, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5571)|
| 1:32:59| And finally, the mediator, I felt it very important that I bring in a mediator to really direct these conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5579)|
| 1:33:10| said, you know, at the end of the day, not always can everybody be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| We've got to make a tough decision here, who that particular group of people will report to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5596)|
| 1:33:23| Well, let me share with you, that one person that stood in opposition to me was my daughter, Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| Wonderful young woman, marvelous lover with all my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| But in this particular situation, she was incorrect in the side that she stood on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| And now she and I will have some subsequent conversations this evening, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| and they probably won't be real sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| But at the end, we will stand united, I assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| And I share that with you, Commissioner Brolls, because sometimes there are people that stand in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| But for the betterment of the group of 12, I had to stand against somebody that I appreciate, love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| and am absolutely, totally enamored with their brilliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| And I do say brilliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| But I had to stand on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| So sometimes that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| And I just wanted to share that story because it was so fresh on my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| I'm used to that with this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| But to all of you, thank you so much for considering KTOM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| We are very appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| Timing is very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| We are just growing like crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| I was able to announce on the loudspeaker today before I left my offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| congratulations, Team KTOM, you had a record day on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| That means a bonus to everybody in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| I will probably be able to announce on Monday, congratulations, Team KTOM, you had an all-time record month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5689)|
| 1:34:57| That also means a bonus to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| And we are looking to have a record month next month and the next month and 14 months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| We work really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| We have a tremendous vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| And it's a team that's just second to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| I think you would be pleased with what we have to bring to your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| Well, with that, now, who wants to vote against that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| Who wants to vote against that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| Yeah, I mean, there's places you can go down to Watt Road and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| But when people get up here and say that, you know, your business is not going to be successful because of your movement there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| that just flies over me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| You're already successful with what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| Reiterate, you're only going to have warehouse space, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| You're not going to be manufacturing and putting off a lot of chemicals and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| You're just basically warehouse and storage is what you're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| And officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| A powerful CSR team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Commissioners, I want to pass this on, and I've told it to some of my clients and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| You know, I've served on the MPC, and we've all had votes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Mr. Brown, he served on the MPC with me a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| I served on the MPC for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| There's one vote that I would take back as an MPC commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| I voted against H.T. Hackney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| And the reason I voted, Amy, is sort of like similar to what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| H.T. Hackney was wanting to go way out next to the Ritter School, out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| We were trying to call their bluff and say, no, you move a little bit closer to the interstate and be closer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| They called our bluff and said, well, we're moving out completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| And I don't want that to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| She means too much to us what it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| We've got 368 acres out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| She's only taken 20 acres, a little over 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| And, folks, we're giving her the newest school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| She gets the newest school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| That's another plus for her employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| So, I'm behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| Good luck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| I think I need to at least respond to a couple of things that Dr. Briggs had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| And I agree, you know, I agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| I agree with the jobs consideration and the livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| These people, I know exactly where we are in terms of our economy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| However, there are other perspectives that are not without merit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| And I think a long-term view of where we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| and where we're going at this particular interchange is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| Indeed, it's the gateway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| We have another gateway on the other end of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| It's called Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| And we've done a real boogered up job on that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| Now, so when I think about this, I think we need to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5868)|
| 1:37:56| I think we need to consider, take a little slower look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| especially as regards this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| Once we cut the ground in this area, we have set ourselves on a pathway of development that will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5884)|
| 1:38:15| And we do not have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| I think planning is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| We've got brains, and we need to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| And just to make a hasty decision about this particular interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| to accommodate the notion that we're going to have some significant tax benefit from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| from this business is short-sighted and is quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| And I think I'm not against it, but I'm just against the timing of it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| I think we need to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| Therefore, I will not be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| Mr. Smith, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| I just want to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| The finance department told me this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| We worked with them on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| And just to let you know, bringing them in here after the five years is up whenever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| and that's just using today's figures, that would be equivalent to 46 homes moving in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| what we generate from tax dollars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5947)|

| 1:39:10| So I won't call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| Mr. Briggs, do you have anything else to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| That's okay if we're going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| The motion on the floor is a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| which would basically say yes to the pilot project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| but it would not be tied to a particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=5964)|

| 1:41:29| Mr. Chairman, could we do our discussion on the school's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| issue so Dr. McIntyre could get back to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| Certainly we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| Been on spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| We will go ahead and do that discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| So, Commissioner Norman, would you like to begin the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| That was your item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| And this is real brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| We will begin with the public comment on the school's issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| So, Commissioner Norman, would you like to begin the discussion that was your item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| And this is real brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| You all received a response, I believe, to my request of Dr. McIntyre of the school folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6121)|
| 1:42:09| to take a look at the budget from the standpoint, trying to make that division where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6129)|
| 1:42:20| we're able to define what we mean by administration, school administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| What is the real cost of administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| What is administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| What is its cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| What percentage of the budget would it be, the total school's budget, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| So you, I believe you all received a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| I'm just starting to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| I think it's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| I think that it also is just a very, very important issue for, it's a fundamental issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| for us to go forward as we consider the request of the superintendent in terms of these increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6174)|
| 1:43:04| revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| And so that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| I just, I think that it will be something that we'll take up here in the next six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| And I'll probably be back in correspondence with the superintendent shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| And I'll keep the, I'll CC the commission on all those types of things as we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| define exactly, as I get closer to this definition that I think is helpful to us as we wrestle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6210)|
| 1:43:40| with the idea of funding for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| So we had agreed to have a joint workshop with the schools on the budget, and we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| talked about April the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| That date is not going to work for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| So we're going to come up with an alternate date, and we'll let the commission, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| work with Mr. Deakins on getting an alternate date for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| Mr. Mack, did you want to respond to anything Commissioner Norman had to say, or I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| to give you that opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| Thank you Mr. Chairman, Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6251)|
| 1:44:28| All I wanted to say was we'll continue the conversation, and certainly we'll work very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| hard to provide the school board, the county commission, and our community with the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| information to make a good, sound decision on the budget recommendation that's been set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| And we'll continue to obviously, we provided a lot of detail last year on what the central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| office is, how many positions we have, what the costs were, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| And we're in the process of putting that together again for the fiscal year 13 budget proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| that will be before the board next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| So I would say in the next week or 10 days or so, we should have a lot more detailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| information that we can provide to the county commission, and certainly to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| and the public about what that looks like, recognizing that we've certainly worked very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| hard to ensure that we're as efficient as we can be in our central office, and we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| to look at those efficiencies, make reductions in administrative and operational areas, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| that we can reallocate those dollars to the classroom, where they can make the greatest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| impact on the education of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| No further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| We'll move on on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| This is on page 10, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6334)|
| 1:45:40| requesting and encouraging appropriate officials at TVA to reconsider and revise its existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| policies regarding the clear-cutting removal of all trees and other vegetation 15 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| and higher located within a total width and length of its property easements which contain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6350)|
| 1:45:56| transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| This is resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| Motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| We have a number of people who have asked to speak on this, so Larry Silverstein, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6362)|
| 1:46:10| you're in attendance, if you would give us your address for the record please, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6370)|
| 1:46:18| have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| 7808 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| I'm speaking in favor of this resolution regarding TVA's tree-cutting policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| I would like to thank Commissioners Owen B. and Broyles for sponsoring this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| I urge Commission to approve this resolution as a first step in sending TVA a clear message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| from Knox County that it must immediately reconsider and then revise its current policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| which is resulting in the needless destruction of tens of thousands of trees in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| and likely millions of trees throughout their entire service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| Cutting down all trees that either are or could be 15 feet or taller, including dogwoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| and redbuds, is just not reasonable as many of these trees could never be a threat to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| the transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| The trees which are now in jeopardy are mostly on the outer limits of TVA's easements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| have never been cut down until the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| TVA says trimming them is too expensive and not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| These trees do not belong to TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| TVA does not acknowledge that possessing an easement does not give the easement holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| unlimited legal rights to cause unreasonable damage to the property or to interfere unreasonably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| with its enjoyment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| Few people have even been aware of TVA's aggressive new policy, but now they are outraged and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| are demanding that our leaders take action to help preserve their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| We are here today to ask for your help to protect our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| This is TVA's policy and it can be changed by TVA and still allow them to maintain their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| Any claims that TVA is being forced by the federal government at FERC, the Federal Energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| Regulatory Commission, to remove all trees 15 feet or taller is simply false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| FERC's document of frequently asked questions includes, quote, is it true that electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| utilities are required by federal law to cut down all the trees near their power lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| In order to prevent power outages, federally approved reliability standards require utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| to manage vegetation growth along the path of their larger power transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| However, federally approved reliability standards do not mandate or prohibit clear cutting or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| any other particular method of vegetation management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| Therefore, TVA is free to change back to prior policies which were more reasonable and did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| not require such drastic removal of trees such as dogwoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| TVA has offered other rationales that just don't stand up to any scrutiny, such as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| outrageous claims of facing huge fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| If TVA has ever been fined solely for tree-related violations, they should explain those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| They claim that they may be fined an unspecified amount for an outage that occurred in 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| in Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| The article in the Sentinel on December 11, 2011 said, quote, the tree was growing within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| a foot or so of the line, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| Well, if a tree was that close to the line, it shouldn't have been, and I would have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| objection to that tree either being trimmed if possible or removed if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| But that is a totally different situation from trees that are far below the lines or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| on the outside of the easement and could never cause a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| So please, don't be fooled by TVA's scary talk of million-dollar fines that have never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| been assessed to TVA or any other utility solely due to a single tree being allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| to be taller than 15 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| Large fines are due to flagrant violations and usually of several different standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| Their spokespeople and their contractors are constantly telling the horror story about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| fines to property owners and the public and will no doubt do so today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| I am prepared to address any of the other reasons given by TVA as to why they have chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| this extreme and unreasonable policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| I hope that this commission will work together with the Knoxville City Council and our two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| mayors to send a strong message to TVA that our trees are a very valuable resource to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6610)|
| 1:50:17| property owners and an asset to our community and the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| Public and private property should not be destroyed unless absolutely necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| This one-size-fits-all policy for 16,000 miles of transmission lines must be changed immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6628)|
| 1:50:36| If our local, state, and federal officials will all work together on this, we can get this policy changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6636)|
| 1:50:43| I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| And I thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| Commissioner Briggs, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| Did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| I just have a comment on this because I am going to vote in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| And I realize that at this level, sometimes I don't like these things that we don't have a whole lot of control over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6658)|
| 1:51:05| here locally because this is a TVA policy and a federal policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| But to me, it's just about a bigger issue of where the heavy hand of the government is coming in against people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6669)|
| 1:51:17| will on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| And they do have an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| I'm not saying they don't have the legal right to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| But coming in on private property and saying, you know, we don't even have to listen to you because we're the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| government or we're a quasi-government agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| And I think that even though it's just our little bit and our little part in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| I think we do need to vote for this to send a message that both we need to get the state involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6695)|
| 1:51:42| and we maybe need to get other states involved because these lines go through states other than just Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| And it may be even at the federal level to get the NERC and the FERC people to change their regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6707)|
| 1:51:54| if, indeed, these fines are as severe as TVA claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| You know, I think all of us want power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| And particularly after last spring, we saw that we literally had hundreds of thousands of people right here in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| county without, you know, without power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| But some of these things that are being done are unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| And I think for us to join in the voice that says we don't want the heavy hand of the government coming onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| private property and cutting down our trees when it's not necessary is a message that we do need to send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| We have other people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| Debra Van Meter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| Debra, if you would come forward and give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| And you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Debra Van Meter, 8700 Dairy and Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| That's in Kensington Subdivision off the North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| I'm here today because my property is directly impacted by the potential of this widespread clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6767)|
| 1:52:57| that is happening around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| First of all, I wanted to thank the commissioners and the members and the officials in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| and the county that have been supportive of the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| and the people that are concerned about these clearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| Would my neighbors and anybody else from Kensington who is here also supporting this resolution please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6795)|
| 1:53:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| I first learned of this last summer when one of my neighbors, Vonnie Gerard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| who was unable to be here called me and was very upset because she had seen men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| had been wandering on her property in her backyard, definitely off TVA easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| And she happened to be there, went out and asked them what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| And they said, well, that they were going to be cutting the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| and they were looking up at the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| This was the first she heard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| She asked to speak to one of their supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| And the next day Mike Nance came out and spoke with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| And he said that TVA was now being more stringent in their clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6839)|
| 1:54:07| And he said that definitely this would not happen fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| And in the interim that he would have a horticulturist or arborist come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| and specifically speak with Mrs. Gerard and tell her which specific trees were in jeopardy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6855)|
| 1:54:23| and there would be more discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| That has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| I personally have a 75-foot TVA easement from the center of a large towered triple line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6871)|
| 1:54:40| that runs high overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| I have lived here for 18 and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| TVA clears every two to three years, clears the brush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| and they clear directly under these three power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| The towers are on opposite ends of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| That's what we're prepared for, even though it's sad to see the brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| and the small trees at that point leveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| We have a family of foxes that have had a den back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| We, of course, have deer, rabbits, lots of bird habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| The brush grows up and serves as a visual screen from our neighbor's homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6912)|
| 1:55:19| We pay the developers a premium price for this additional 75-foot of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| It wasn't like it was given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| We're here today because TVA now insists on clearing the full width of the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| which is 75 feet from the center in each direction in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| In 2007, my family and I built a pool with a cabana| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| and had extensive landscaping installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| I called TVA at that time and informed them of my plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| and informed them of the types of plantings, my cryptomeria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| flowering cherry, redbud trees, Nelly R. Stevens hollies, shrubs, and flowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| I told the gentleman that we also wanted to have a pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| that would go onto and off of TVA, excuse me, a fence for our pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| that would go on and off of the TVA easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| He said there would not be a problem as long as there was a gate to the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| that if TVA ever needed, they could get onto my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| So that was in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| If these regulations dated back to 2003, why was I told at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| that where I was planting all this landscaping was okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6979)|
| 1:56:25| At this point, all of the landscaping within two and a half feet of my cabana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| everything back that we have added is now at risk for what they're presently clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| I asked TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| I'm asking TVA to notify property owners with TVA easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| at least 60 days in advance of any clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| There was a newspaper article today that said we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| and Kensington has been notified that was incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| We have not been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| I don't know how far an electric current can arc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| I know that's been one of the statements that fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| the safety factor of a current arcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| These power lines are, I don't know, 7,500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| I've never been told how far they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| They're huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| They are half again higher than any trees that are anywhere close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| These are mature, full trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| They're not encroaching any further onto the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| And y'all emailed photos that actually included my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| You can see my plantings back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| They are not directly under the power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| They'll never come anywhere close to the power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| And the mature trees up the hill from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| which my neighbor owns part of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| She has a large oak, several mature pines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| and none of these have ever had any arcing, any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Nothing's going to be helped by clearing these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| except it's just going to be increased in expense for TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| to continue to maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Thank y'all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| Next, we have Juanita Braswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| And if you would give us your address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| I'm Juanita Davis Braswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| I live at 7116 Wellington Drive, zip code 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| I am president of the Dean Hill Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| and have lived in the community 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| I will cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| The reason we're here is to ask the Knox County Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| to seek a reasonable resolution for TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7112)|
| 1:58:37| to amend the present tree trimming policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| A tree of 15 feet or taller is not a reason to cut trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| Yes, the community realizes transmission lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| must be cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| Cared trees are valuable to the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| The trees were initially planted with approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| for their slow-growing beauty to provide privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| as well as creating a sound barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| to the Dean Hill community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Surely, there are options available that TVA can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| in approaching a solution to this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| I am requesting the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| pass a resolution to pursue these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| Thank you for appearing before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| Summer Henry, if you would give us your address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| for the record, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| Summer Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| I live at 913 Greenhills Road, zip code 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| I spoke before, I think, most of you last week at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| and for those that I didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| I'll kind of start from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| I have a fairly lengthy relationship with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| if that's what you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| with TVA on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| Three years ago, we entered into negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| that lasted approximately three months with TVA officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| There were five people involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| most of who are behind me here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| that resulted in us being told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| that if we were to trim one tree in particular on our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| the only one that was deemed to be a threat to the power lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7232)|
| 2:00:37| which was a sweet gum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| that if we would trim that tree at our expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| which was close to $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| to their specifications by a certified arborist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| that they would approve that the tree would be allowed to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7247)|
| 2:00:53| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| In fact, we were told 20 feet to be trimmed from the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| We actually trimmed 25, trimmed in excess of the diagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| That was, I have a letter here that was authored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| by their senior legal counsel, Don Whitehead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| with diagrams as to what we were to trim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| We did in excess of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| Additionally, they state in the diagram,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| we recommend, do not require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| five foot from the top of the cedar tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| We trimmed actually 10 foot from the top of that cedar tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| And then there were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| or it's actually two cedar trees that grow together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| There was also a crape myrtle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| a very short, small bush of a crape myrtle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| and then a pine tree that you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| just to the left-hand side of this photo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| that was not even in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| None of those trees stand today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| They were cut two and a half weeks ago by TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| after they came onto our property with armed police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| solely for the reason that we did not want them there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| and did not agree to having them trimmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| They came, seven people that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| including two armed police with handguns, tear gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| and tasers that stood over our backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| while they basically decimated and left us with one tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7330)|
| 2:02:16| And you cannot imagine the frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| that a homeowner feels, unless you've been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| when you have this kind of thing occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| where you have basically no rights, you feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| no control over your own home, your property, your backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| your ability to enjoy your home and your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| We tried for two weeks prior to this to work with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7357)|
| 2:02:43| to see why the new stance, why after this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| after the money that we spent that's now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| you know, we might as well have run it through a paper shredder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| why this was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| I dealt with Michael Nance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| who is the right-of-way specialist for our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| as well as Jason Rigg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| Got absolutely nowhere with either one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| In fact, I'd spoken with Mr. Rigg two days before the cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| and had asked for a number to his direct supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| which he refused to give to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| I did leave a voicemail, as well as I emailed Don Whitehead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| who was their senior legal counsel that authored the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| Previously, he refused to return my calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| We also spoke with Wilson Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| who is their external ombudsman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| the joke of which is that he is supposed to be sort of a mediator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| and a very neutral party between TVA and landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| That's humorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| His response was, I have hundreds of trees on my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| and do you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| Because I don't live near power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| That's actually what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| That's a lot to have to swallow when someone tells you that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| as if you should be penalized for living near a TVA easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| You know, I feel like we went out of our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| We spent money out of pocket to do exactly what they asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| to do more than they asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| And then that's all, you know, completely for naught now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| because we have a small redbed tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| and one remaining pine tree in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| Our pine tree that was cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| which was never in question previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| was probably about 12 feet from our back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| We now have no shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| We get direct sun in the back of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| I'm sure our utility bills will be increased as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| Besides that, just the lowering of the property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| and the mess that we now have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| We had several neighbors who also lost trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| as well as trees in our wood line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| Ms. Henry, your time is about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7498)|
| 2:04:59| Ms. Henry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| Did you take when they came out and started cutting your trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| did you not have that for them to show them, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| In fact, I discussed this with them at length over the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| prior to, and they said they had seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| And, you know, it really meant nothing to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| I think TVA has been so accustomed over the years to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| just running roughshod over anyone that gets in their path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| It doesn't matter if you say, I don't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| This is my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| Why are you doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| We had an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| You know, it just doesn't matter to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| They will do what they want to do when they want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| by force if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| I mean, it's pretty bad when you have armed police standing over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7537)|
| 2:05:42| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| And when I went out to observe what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| every time that I would approach Mr. Regg or Mr. Nance to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| with them about something, the police would come as well and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| stand over me as if I was some sort of a threat that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| needed to be prepared to deal with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| You had to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| Our next speaker is William Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| William, your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| And you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| William Daniels, 1505 Botsford Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| I also live in Kensington with some of the folks that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| The reason I wanted to speak today is obviously Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| has the right to issue a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| and that's perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| But there's some things about the power business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| and I was in it for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| I haven't been in it for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| but I used to work for TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| I used to fly the power lines because that was part of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| And so I used to have to fly in a helicopter with a Vietnam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| Trust me, you don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| But being above the trees, being above the right-of-way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| looking at it gives you a totally different perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| than standing on the ground looking up at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| Power lines, and I happen to see there's some folks from TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| here that I'm sure are going to speak as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| but power lines during the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| there's a thing called sag, and it means how far does the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| lines actually drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| In the summertime, it's nothing for a power line on a 500 kV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| line to drop 20, 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| So a power line can be 70 feet in the air with a sag already of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| 20 feet from tower to tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| In the summertime, it's going to drop additionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| And living in Kensington, trust me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| I don't want TVA cutting a single tree in any of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| neighbors' backyards or up and down that power line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| Also, we have a piece of property in North Knoxville Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| that has a 500 kV line that runs across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| So I get hit twice by the new initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| However, being in the utility business for that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| being in the utility business for that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| the greatest opposition to reliable electricity that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7688)|
| 2:08:15| factories need that we want in our homes is vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| and squirrels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Lightning also is another issue, storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| But when your power flickers on and off during a storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| it goes off, comes back on, goes off, comes back on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| it's normally because there's a tree limb line across the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| Factories can't take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| Power lines have to be kept clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| If they don't, there are issues of fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| I have flown over hundreds of miles of power line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| Looks like from the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| Walk some of it and look up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| Looks like it's a mile away from the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| But when you fly over it, you can look down on top and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| can see that the leaves are turning brown on top of the tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| from the heat from the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| So it's not a case of what you can see and you can't see from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| It's what FERC also is requiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| I still stay up with utilities because it's a love of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| I love serving people and that's what utilities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7759)|
| 2:09:27| I don't necessarily agree with what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| I'm disappointed to hear some of the stories that some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| folks have told about how they were treated, what they were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| I don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| That's the wrong way to handle business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| And I wouldn't approve of it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| But in 20 years of utility business, I never wanted to cut a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7785)|
| 2:09:51| That was something I didn't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| It's the most expensive maintenance that a utility ever does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| And my understanding is TVA has committed $200 million to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| right-of-way clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Now, FERC did issue a ruling back a year, probably a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| six months ago, when they had the cascading event in the north part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| of our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| When one substation shuts down in the summertime, it can cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| others to shut down, called cascading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| It can continue until it basically, it can't do it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| It shuts down enough utility that basically the system shuts down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| That's what happened in the northeast several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| It happened in the Midwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| People didn't get their power back on for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| It's a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| Factories shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| People didn't have air conditioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| They're 100 degrees out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| So while this is problematic, it's problematic for me as a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7846)|
| 2:10:51| It's problematic for my neighbors as property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| But right-of-way clearing is something that's got to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| Trust me, if TVA, and I don't get paid by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| I didn't even know TVA was going to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| But if they've put in their budget $200 million to clean right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7864)|
| 2:11:10| it's because they've been told by the people they pay to clean right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| that this is what they're going to have to do or they're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| catastrophic failures known as rolling blackouts, known as cascading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| Your time is about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| The other thing is you can't prune trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| You have to cut them, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| My yard looks like a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| I don't want anybody cutting a tree in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| But you can't afford the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| We couldn't afford the rates if they pruned trees on right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7906)|
| 2:11:55| If you would give us your address, then you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| My name is Margo Klein, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| And I'm speaking in favor of this resolution that the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| take action to provide Knox County citizens with a detailed list or information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| a map, whatever, about which TVA lines in Knox County are scheduled to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7934)|
| 2:12:20| clearing take place in the easement area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| I am the president of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7942)|
| 2:12:26| and I'm also on the board of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| I have devoted a lot of hours to looking into this, but I've only learned about it for about three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| And it has been extremely difficult to go to TVA's website and find out what are the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7955)|
| 2:12:43| which lines are we talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| I can tell you right now that just because I know the Kensington lines are going to be maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7965)|
| 2:12:52| and that there won't be vegetation cut in that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| that the same line that affects Kensington also goes through Farrington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7975)|
| 2:13:01| Plantation Springs, Westland West, Homeowners Association, and Gulfwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| Now, those are all members of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| I can tell you that I think they're going to have their trees cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| but I can't tell you that with certainty because I can't find that anyplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| I don't know if the power carried on those lines is over 200 kilovolts or if it's 161 kilovolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8000)|
| 2:13:28| The newspaper says most TVA lines do not carry over 200 kilovolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| Those might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| They might not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| As Larry said, it's not a one-size-fits-all situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| I have here something from FERC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| The fellow who just spoke right before me said that it's really important to keep these lines clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| because FERC will fine you if you don't, and it jeopardizes keeping our power on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| I totally understand the need to keep easements cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| But this statement from FERC says not all power lines are subject to national reliability standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| The national electric system is divided into two different domains for regulatory purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8045)|
| 2:14:12| largely based on the voltage of the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| High-voltage transmission lines and lower-voltage transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| High-voltage lines operate above 200,000 volts or 200 kilovolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| So there are some things that I think could be done to help clear up this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| First and foremost, for Knox County to ask the NPC to put information on the KGIS.org site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8072)|
| 2:14:44| to indicate which of these lines carry 200 volts or more, where they're located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| who's going to be scheduled to have those lines, easements trimmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| TBA, as I said, does not provide clear, documented, and easy-to-access information to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8096)|
| 2:15:03| And this new tree-cutting policy is not only a jeopardy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| does not only put trees of private homeowners in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| It appears to me it also puts trees that are in some public spaces or along right-of-ways in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| In particular, I'm aware of the parking lot between Rafferty's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| and Walgreens at the corner of South Peters Road and Kingston Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8124)|
| 2:15:30| I live right off that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| I drive by there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| There are a lot of redbud trees in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| There are a few Bradford pears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| They appear to be between about 20 and 40 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| Now, assuming, because that's the same line that runs through Kensington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8140)|
| 2:15:44| assuming that every tree, every bush growing over 15 feet has to be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8144)|
| 2:15:50| there will not be a stick of vegetation left in that parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| So I'm going to have to look at a hot, dusty, noisy parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8155)|
| 2:16:01| And you all know that we work real hard to make our city more beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| So we don't have the answers that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| We need to get TBA to, again, tell us which lines they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| What's the expense that they're looking at for clearing these lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| And how is the spending of this money going to save taxpayers money, as they say it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8177)|
| 2:16:22| The news center reported that we're going to see a three percent increase in Knox County from TBA in the month of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8182)|
| 2:16:29| If they're saving us money doing this, why are we getting our rates increased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| We don't know the justification for clearing 15 feet and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| They don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| FERC doesn't give, say, 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| It just says you can't have an incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| How many incidents have they had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| How many fines have they paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| I haven't seen that anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| I just think that we need to ask these tough questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| Bert Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8215)|
| 2:17:05| Mr. Robinson, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| Chairman, may I approach with handouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8233)|
| 2:17:28| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, my name is Bert Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| I live at 1716 Dancing Light Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| I'm very pleased to be with you this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| and thank you for this opportunity to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| Earlier today, I sent an e-mail to each of you with a letter from our chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| excuse me, our executive vice president and chief energy delivery officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| You may have seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| You may have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8272)|
| 2:17:53| So with the chair's permission, I'd like to read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| And it's addressed to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| Mr. Chairman Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| I am writing regarding Knox County Resolution R-12-903,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| pertaining to TVA's vegetation maintenance program on transmission line rights of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| which will be considered at today's commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| It is important that you and other members of the commission know the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| and approach that TVA is taking to ensure a safe, reliable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| regulatory-compliant and cost-effective transmission system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| Such a system is key in implementing TVA's vision of being one of the nation's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| leading providers of low-cost and cleaner energy by 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| TVA is proud that since 2000, its power system has been 99.999% reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| On August 14, 2003, much of the Midwest and Northeast portions of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| experienced a blackout that caused approximately 50 million people to lose power for up to two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8326)|
| 2:18:52| contributed to at least 11 deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| and cost the U.S. economy an estimated $6 billion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| according to an August 13, 2008 article in Scientific American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| The root cause of the event was an inadequate transmission line vegetation management program in Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8343)|
| 2:19:10| In other words, the ultimate cause of this blackout was a tree that came in contact with power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| That tree caused 531 generators to trip offline almost instantaneously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8356)|
| 2:19:22| including 19 nuclear units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| and approximately 62,000 megawatts of electricity generation to immediately separate from the grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8364)|
| 2:19:30| The North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8370)|
| 2:19:34| sets electric reliability standards for utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| Under Section 215 of the Federal Power Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| NERC also sets federal requirements for right-of-way maintenance activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8381)|
| 2:19:47| These requirements, commonly referred to as Fact 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| are a major focus of utility audits by NERC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8390)|
| 2:19:53| and enforcement actions by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| Inadequate right-of-way maintenance activities have led to utilities being fined by NERC and FERC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8398)|
| 2:20:03| typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| with other remediation costing millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| These additional actions are a consequence of the 2003 blackout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| In designing a transmission line vegetation maintenance program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| that addresses the concerns raised by NERC and FERC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| TVA has implemented a program that reduces the risk of trees contacting the transmission lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8419)|
| 2:20:25| which helps maintain public safety and system reliability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| and avoids potential financial penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| Our policy requires TVA to cut down all trees 15 feet or higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| or ones that have the potential to grow taller than 15 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| to ensure power lines are not affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| Although there are some utilities that allow the planting of taller trees within the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| it is generally not compatible with high reliability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| Expensive maintenance programs are needed to manage taller growing trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| The frequent pruning encourages rapid regrowth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| and trees that need to be managed can be easily overlooked in a system as large as TVA's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| with almost 16,000 miles of transmission line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| It is important to note that TVA can be penalized as much as $1 million a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| For each day, we allow even a single tree to encroach within a specified distance of power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| Therefore, TVA has adopted an aggressive vegetation management program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| based on the wire zone border zone method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| and see attached document entitled, Understanding TVA's Vegetation Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| TVA may allow low-growing species, less than 15 feet at mature height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| to be planted in the border zone, that is within the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| but not directly under transmission structures or conductors next to transmission lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| but express TVA's approval is required in each case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| However, narrow rights-of-way or easements may not allow for a border zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8502)|
| 2:21:47| TVA no longer allows taller, incompatible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| that's species that exceed 15 feet at mature height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8510)|
| 2:21:54| trees within its right-of-way when requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| even if landowners say they will control tree height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| TVA is removing, sometimes extensively, incompatible species from its rights-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| The sponsor of the resolution in question indicated his concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| that this was an issue of property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| TVA agrees with that and wants to point out that, beginning in 1933,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| TVA began purchasing easements and rights-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| most of which contained the perpetual right by TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| to clear the rights-of-way and keep them clear of trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| brush, buildings, structures, and fire hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| Legally, TVA has the right to completely clear its rights-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| However, in an effort to find some common ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| the policy does allow for low-growing species, as mentioned above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| Understandably, this is a sensitive subject for property owners who are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| TVA staff involved in maintaining rights-of-way work hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| to educate property owners on the need for this maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| and TVA's policies on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| TVA has an obligation and responsibility to maintain public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| and electric service reliability by taking steps to eliminate risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| Public service is a high calling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| and with it comes great responsibility to act in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| of the citizens you represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| both for TVA and for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| Approval of this resolution would, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| be asking TVA to sacrifice public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| system reliability, and regulatory compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| Respectfully, TVA is not willing to make that sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| Therefore, TVA would request that commissioners reject this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this pending resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| Sincerely, Robin E. Manning, professional engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| Mr. Chairman, with that, that concludes my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| I did want to state that at the request of commission last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| we do have a member of our right-of-way staff here with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| I have one question, Mr. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| You know, I completely understand and believe that it's within your right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| to clear your right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| But the issue I have is with TVA agreeing to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| and then coming in and doing something totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| Now, we just heard one side of the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| but you enter into somebody's property to take away something you told them they could grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8643)|
| 2:24:09| Now, whether or not she was out of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| I mean, we don't know that as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| but this is a PR nightmare you don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8653)|
| 2:24:18| And so I just, you know, I don't understand that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8658)|
| 2:24:27| And I mean, these people purchase these properties knowing the right-of-way is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| and knowing they're going to have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| But why do you do something that if this is true, why does TVA do what they go against what they agreed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8674)|
| 2:24:42| Commissioner, thanks for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| And certainly want to be mindful of the issue that this is between TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| and an individual property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| However, I can say that last week we were able to provide the agreement that was referred to earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| to one of your colleagues on commission, one of the sponsors of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| And, in fact, the agreement states, and I'm paraphrasing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| but that we would not give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| The agreement is that we would not give up any rights of the United States in executing the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| and also that we would not be cutting trees that particular year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| It does not say in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8717)|
| 2:25:18| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| Commissioner Willenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| I was going to bring that up because I did meet with TVA on Friday to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8724)|
| 2:25:30| The reason I brought the resolution was I felt that TVA was, and I'll say my terms, bullying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8730)|
| 2:25:40| when they kind of tore in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| And I will apologize for saying it looked like a tornado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| I don't mean it tornado-like, houses blown everywhere and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8748)|
| 2:25:52| I meant the tracks and the ruts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| But TVA has put down straw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| They did do, you know, cleaned up the area, which is different from the policy from three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| where they didn't clean up anything until after pressure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8763)|
| 2:26:07| and then they decided to start cleaning up to try to be a good citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| The letter was provided to me, and it does state that it was only for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8774)|
| 2:26:20| And I was under the impression that it was forever and ever, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| And there's other things, other questions that I ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| And we had a very long meeting, and I appreciate you taking your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8790)|
| 2:26:37| Would you explain to the rest of the commission why the 15-foot and not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8797)|
| 2:26:43| There's other utility companies, I guess, that only they don't allow anything above 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8803)|
| 2:26:49| So maybe you all can answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8809)|
| 2:26:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| Mr. Chairman, with your permission, I'd like to recognize Jason Rigg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| Certainly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| Jason Rigg, 7590 Lacey J Lane, Ottawa, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| The reason for the 15-foot mature height is these trees don't have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| It's not distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| If you pull that up, I'll show you what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| The distribution lines are insulated, low-voltage lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8831)|
| 2:27:17| What we have are high-voltage, non-insulated transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| So a tree does not have to touch the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| It can just be within a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| And under the right conditions, it will go to ground through that tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8848)|
| 2:27:36| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| I just wanted to bring to light here four of the main reasons that we have made the decisions we've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8858)|
| 2:27:45| in relation to our vegetation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| One on being safety, and I just mentioned the difference between transmission and distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| Now, distribution, when a tree knocks out a line there, you're looking at about three houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8871)|
| 2:27:58| or a street or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| If a tree gets into one of our lines, you're looking at potentially 100,000s of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| industries, hospitals, red lights, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| So there is a difference, and that's the reliability portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8888)|
| 2:28:13| Again, you've heard all about the compliance with federal regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| And, yes, this only does apply to 200 kV and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8896)|
| 2:28:19| We've publicly stated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| We do expect, industry expects, that this gets pushed down to include 100 kV and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| which simply means that would be the majority of our transmission system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| So that's why we're taking the approach we're taking now, trying to be proactive in the event that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| regulations do come down or are pertinent to the other voltages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| Also, cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| We heard earlier 16,000 miles of transmission line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| Trimming equals very high cost associated with that large of a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8929)|
| 2:28:55| When you remove the tree and the threats, then from here on out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| we can manage the system by lower growing species, mowing, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| which cost is tremendously lower than doing tree trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8944)|
| 2:29:09| If you give me one second, I just want to show a couple of pictures here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8949)|
| 2:29:13| This is essentially just a drawing of our right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| The buffer zone you see on the edge or the border zone is where we would allow 15-foot mature height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8955)|
| 2:29:21| And let me say that's not just a government thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8961)|
| 2:29:25| Duke, Progress Energy, Georgia Transmission, if you look up what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8965)|
| 2:29:30| they also do 15-foot mature height within theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| As a matter of fact, Progress Energy draws the line at 12-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8973)|
| 2:29:41| That's the measurement of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8981)|
| 2:29:47| Our transmission lines don't have one specific right-of-way width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| There are multiple right-of-way widths out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| So this is just a general picture of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| Now if you'll show the next picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| This is just to give you an example of the difference between distribution and transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9001)|
| 2:30:06| This was in Knox County coming out of Bull Run, and a tree fell into one of our transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9006)|
| 2:30:12| That is a 161 kV, the same voltage that was in the back of the property that we recently removed those trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9012)|
| 2:30:20| This is what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9020)|
| 2:30:22| Obviously, if somebody had been standing there, it wouldn't have been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9022)|
| 2:30:31| I just wanted to show this picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| This is a tree on one of our 500 kV lines in Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| This was back in the late 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| This was well before the standard was put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| This particular tree, the property owner didn't want cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| There was a lot of going back and forth about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| During that time, since it was so hot, the gentleman earlier mentioned that lines do sag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9046)|
| 2:30:51| And that's what happened in Ohio with the large blackout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| This line sagged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| It didn't touch this tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| It just got close enough that it arced to this tree, and it went to ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| And with that amount of voltage, it blew the ground out like that, found a path to the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9062)|
| 2:31:09| burnt the ductwork in it, the electrical system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| Unfortunately, nobody was home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| The next picture I'm going to show you is on a different transmission system, not TVAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| You see a 500 kV line in the background there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| Those are two trees beside it that were dangerously close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9082)|
| 2:31:27| The force of that voltage blew that tree apart, and it found a path to this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9087)|
| 2:31:33| So this isn't just a compliance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9093)|
| 2:31:36| This is a safety concern for us and the people that, you know, the people that own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9096)|
| 2:31:43| We have to keep them safe also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| These are the trees that are at the Summit Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| Pictures of them to show you that they are directly under the conductor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| and much higher than 15 foot material height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| I heard earlier that transmission lines are 60 to 70 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| There's all types of different clearances out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| TVA built most of their transmission system to meet minimum clearance standards or NESC standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| So there's plenty of areas out there where we only have about 30 foot to ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120326?start=9131)|
