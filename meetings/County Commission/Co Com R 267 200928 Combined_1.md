| 2:49:18| Okay, and then they can do up to 95 dwelling units on this property then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10158)|
| 2:49:25| At 12 units per acre, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10165)|
| 2:49:30| Oh, can we comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| Mr. Beeler, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| Did you have a response, sir, to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| You know, if I can, I wasn't sure if I can just interject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| So my home currently, you know, I don't want to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| It's a nice home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10182)|
| 2:49:42| I'm remodeling it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| So we're going to split that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10184)|
| 2:49:46| So we would not hit the full capacity on, I mean, maybe on the density we would, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10186)|
| 2:49:51| I'm splitting off my home on about two acres there to keep that section there or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10191)|
| 2:49:56| I just, yeah, and then we're looking at maybe the additional six acres for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10196)|
| 2:50:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10201)|
| 2:50:02| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| I have to come back to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| That's the whole point of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| You know, I think the concern of the neighboring condominiums is not so much that the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10210)|
| 2:50:16| is the same, it's that the density is quite a bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| You know, there's a big difference between 5 and 12 as to what you can do, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10220)|
| 2:50:27| there's also a limitation to what you can do on six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10231)|
| 2:50:32| Could you speak to potential planned improvements to Straw Plains Pike in that direction toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10232)|
| 2:50:38| John Sevier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10238)|
| 2:50:39| Sure, be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| Short term, we're going to be repaving it this year, or pardon me, next year, early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10241)|
| 2:50:46| 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| More long term, hopefully in the next eight to 10 years, we are adding the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10248)|
| 2:50:55| to make Straw Plains Pike a multi-lane facility by using TPO federal and state dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10255)|
| 2:51:03| That is something that it's one of the few major arterials the county maintains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10263)|
| 2:51:08| It connects East Governor John Sevier Highway to essentially the interstate, so we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10268)|
| 2:51:14| to make that project one that we would like to see moved up into the TIP that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10274)|
| 2:51:20| for it to be a four lane, you know, median divided highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| So there are at least as the county's plans to move forward with some, you know, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| pretty decent size infrastructure improvements in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10290)|
| 2:51:32| I think the concern we face a lot now with this body is once we rezone something, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10292)|
| 2:51:39| limited into what we're going to be able to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| A lot of things are going to fall to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10301)|
| 2:51:44| However, the planned residential process, I'm assuming there would be a lot of checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10304)|
| 2:51:51| and balances, a lot of things that this would have to go through depending on the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10311)|
| 2:51:56| that the gentleman wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| Would that ever come back to County Commission for any reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| Not this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| Once this rezoning was heard, it would go through a concept plan and design plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| would be heard by Planning Commission and then design plan would be reviewed by my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10329)|
| 2:52:14| prior to the work being started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10334)|
| 2:52:17| Any flooding issues would be addressed at that time as well, I assume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| I'm looking at the drainage map now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10341)|
| 2:52:23| There's a 10-foot diameter culvert under Straw Plains Pike there, so that gives you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10343)|
| 2:52:28| the magnitude of the amount of water that does flow through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| But we'll make sure that all aspects of our stormwater ordinance are met to the strict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10351)|
| 2:52:36| adherence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| I think this concept process is going to help a lot of situations like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| I do share the same concerns, and if it weren't going through that process, I would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10362)|
| 2:52:46| concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10366)|
| 2:52:47| But the fact that it is, I think that the Planning Commission staff and the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| staff will do a good job to make sure the right kind of development goes into this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10370)|
| 2:52:54| So I'll move that we approve this per the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10378)|
| 2:52:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10379)|
| 2:53:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| Second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10381)|
| 2:53:02| First by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10382)|

| 2:53:06| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10388)|
| 2:53:09| Good luck with your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10389)|

| 2:53:59| GC General Commercial because of changing conditions by a vote of 11 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10439)|

| 2:54:18| for the record as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10458)|
| 2:54:19| Yes, Bart McFadden, 1745 Windrush Circle, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10459)|
| 2:54:25| Could you just very quickly tell us what your approval or what your application is because of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10465)|
| 2:54:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10471)|
| 2:54:32| In hopes of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| Yeah, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10474)|
| 2:54:34| The Boys and Girls Club has been there now 20 years in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| Originally, it was built on a two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| A dry gap pack probably about 10, 15 years ago got improved to a four-lane divided median road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10482)|
| 2:54:47| and that spurred a ton of commercial development between Emory Road and Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10487)|
| 2:54:53| I think I got the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| I may be wrong, but Cunningham Road, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| And you see a lot of commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| At that time, we were zoned planned residential, and again, that was appropriate at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10501)|
| 2:55:07| But as we started looking at trying to get an electronic messaging center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10507)|
| 2:55:11| planned residential did not allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10511)|
| 2:55:14| And that is a pretty key part of what the Boys and Girls Club is trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10514)|
| 2:55:18| as far as notifying people and keeping things up to date in their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10518)|
| 2:55:22| And during this time of COVID, they've needed that in spades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10522)|
| 2:55:27| But as we looked at it, what the Boys and Girls Club does is more of a commercial concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10527)|
| 2:55:35| than it is a residential concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10535)|
| 2:55:36| And so we thought that would be an opportunity to get that zoning kind of straightened out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10536)|
| 2:55:42| as well as allow the messaging center to understand that planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| if something changes, which we don't anticipate that that will ever happen with the Boys and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10547)|
| 2:55:51| Girls Club, that has to come back in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| So if that use ever changes, that planned commercial means that just like planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10554)|
| 2:55:59| it has to come back in front of this to be vetted and have things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10559)|
| 2:56:03| So Bart may want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| He hopes the Boys and Girls Club is going to be there for another 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| And we all do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10569)|
| 2:56:10| Yeah, any concern that that property would ever be sold or used for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10570)|
| 2:56:15| different other than serving children couldn't be further from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| Obviously, there's a growing need in that community, a growing number of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10579)|
| 2:56:22| We want to continue to serve kids in that community for the long haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10582)|
| 2:56:25| And that's what we intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10585)|
| 2:56:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| I'm going to recognize first Commissioner Schoonmaker had his light on with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| And then I'm going to go to Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10594)|
| 2:56:35| In our packet, we had some course, but let me back up a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10595)|
| 2:56:40| MPC staff recommended denial of this rezoning originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10600)|
| 2:56:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10605)|
| 2:56:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| And you felt that it wasn't appropriate to have a digital sign on this location as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10608)|
| 2:56:53| reason for the denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10613)|
| 2:56:54| No, that was not the reason for the recommendation of denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10614)|
| 2:56:58| As you all know, when we're looking at a rezoning and a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10618)|
| 2:57:02| in particular for a rezoning, we're looking at all the uses that are allowed in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10622)|
| 2:57:06| We're not looking at the specific use being proposed or currently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10626)|
| 2:57:10| We have to look at all potential impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10635)|
| 2:57:15| And I noticed in our packet that scenic Knoxville was opposed to this rezoning because of its,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10635)|
| 2:57:23| I guess, its distance off of the main, you know, main Emory Road that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10643)|
| 2:57:28| why would you put a digital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10648)|
| 2:57:30| And I guess the underlying condition would be, are they rezoning this so that down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10650)|
| 2:57:36| that they could just sell that property and turn that into a commercial establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10656)|
| 2:57:45| That would be a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10665)|
| 2:57:46| I mean, again, we try not to look at the use in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| but all the potential uses that could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| Mr. Schoonmaker, no, that's not why we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10673)|
| 2:57:57| Again, I don't know if you've been to Dry Gap Park before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| I certainly have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10680)|
| 2:58:01| Okay, I mean, when you start, you've got a hamburger place, a closed place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10681)|
| 2:58:06| Now you've got a mini storage warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| There's a KUB substation across the road, the Hallsdale Powell wastewater plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10688)|
| 2:58:13| Adjacent to the substation is a floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10693)|
| 2:58:17| So we can't go, commercial can go no further than that, even if it needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10697)|
| 2:58:21| Across the street, Bricky McLeod School with an electronic messaging center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10701)|
| 2:58:26| There is a subdivision entrance, and then there's a Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| If you look at that corridor, and again, I've been doing this a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10708)|
| 2:58:32| When you look at four-lane divided median roads, they screen commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10712)|
| 2:58:37| And if you go on the other side, you start out at Cunningham, there's a hair place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10717)|
| 2:58:44| There's a mini mall, excuse me, a strip mall, a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10724)|
| 2:58:49| There's two other properties that one may be going towards commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10729)|
| 2:58:52| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| So I mean, this is a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| So to us, it made sense to make this consistent with what the rest of the area is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10736)|
| 2:59:00| which is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10740)|
| 2:59:01| And it allows us the electronic messaging center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| And again, the reason we went plain commercial instead of just straight C, whatever, commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10744)|
| 2:59:10| was because if in any instance, which we don't anticipate this ever happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10750)|
| 2:59:15| somebody came in and said, we want to turn that into some other use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10755)|
| 2:59:19| they would have to come back in front of this body to get that adjudicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| And it's not just open to anything at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| So that's, or come in front of the planning process, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| So that's kind of why we use that zoning plain commercial instead of just asking for a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10769)|
| 2:59:34| one of the commercial designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10776)|
| 2:59:37| Well, you also have to understand our point of view too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10777)|
| 2:59:41| We have to be good stewards of the county's money because later this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10781)|
| 2:59:45| we're going to be appropriating $260,000 to the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10785)|
| 2:59:50| So, you know, we don't want the public to perceive that we're appropriating them funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10790)|
| 2:59:55| and then at the same time rezoning their property so they could bail out of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| to go to someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10799)|
| 3:00:00| And I'll just point out too, the electronic messaging center is actually being donated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10800)|
| 3:00:05| by one of the sponsors at the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| So I mean, none of the funds you're appropriating would go anywhere near any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10808)|
| 3:00:11| So they do a great job of taking care of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10811)|
| 3:00:16| And I'm on their board, one of the reasons that I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10816)|
| 3:00:19| And they do some impressive work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10819)|
| 3:00:23| And this messaging center would allow us the opportunity to keep people informed better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10823)|
| 3:00:29| than that little plastic thing that's up there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10833)|
| 3:00:33| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10835)|
| 3:00:36| It's my pleasure to make a motion that we approve this sector plan per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10836)|
| 3:00:45| And I'm really glad to see that we'll see what's going on at the Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10845)|
| 3:00:51| more readily now than we wouldn't have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10856)|
| 3:00:57| The staff made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10857)|
| 3:01:00| They recommended denial of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| The MPC commissioners overrode that denial and made approval of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10862)|
| 3:01:08| So if you say you're making a motion to approve the staff recommendation, that's to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10868)|
| 3:01:13| deny this rezoning or sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10875)|
| 3:01:16| I believe you'll reword it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10876)|
| 3:01:17| Into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10877)|
| 3:01:17| I'll just reword it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| I want to make a motion to accept the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10879)|
| 3:01:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| I believe what Commissioner Busley, if I might make a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| you're making a motion to approve per planning commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10891)|
| 3:01:36| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| Well, you're planning committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10901)|
| 3:01:42| Planning commission, not planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| Planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10905)|
| 3:01:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10906)|
| 3:01:47| Is there a motion or is there a second for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10909)|
| 3:01:49| Second by Commissioner Beals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| Additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10911)|
| 3:01:51| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| Yeah, just one question, Amy, is it sounds like Commissioner Screenmakers got me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10913)|
| 3:01:59| think and the reason we want this or Mr. Campbell is because of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10919)|
| 3:02:03| Is there not a better zoning that we can have this digital sign there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10923)|
| 3:02:09| Is this the best zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| The zones are very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| I can articulate, you know, why the planning commission recommended approval of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| if you'd like for me to, but in terms of the zones, it's CA, CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10940)|
| 3:02:26| DH, PC, SC, most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| Then it gets into the industrial zones that are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| So it's very limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| The current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10954)|
| 3:02:36| Your opinion, this is the best zone for what they're needing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10956)|
| 3:02:41| You know, because it does get to come back for additional review by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10961)|
| 3:02:47| and by our staff and by Knox County staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| Yes, planned commercial is the more appropriate zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10970)|
| 3:02:56| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10976)|
| 3:02:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10977)|

| 3:03:00| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| I guess what you're trying to say is that the potential zones that this would work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10983)|
| 3:03:08| this zoning gives you the most oversight as a planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10988)|
| 3:03:14| So if the if the if the property was to ever change hands, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10994)|
| 3:03:19| a site plan would be provided for additional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| There's a proper motion on the table from Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| with a proper second from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11007)|
| 3:03:29| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11009)|

| 3:08:56| This is a fairly large project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11336)|

| 3:09:13| The property has a zoning that we're asking for on the front, which is a CV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11353)|
| 3:09:20| and then once it goes over the backside, there's mixed zonings back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11360)|
| 3:09:26| We have plans that we've been working with several different entities on to bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11366)|
| 3:09:33| a sports-related industry into Knoxville, which ties in with the study that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11373)|
| 3:09:40| had done as far as bringing in sports to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11380)|
| 3:09:44| Along with that goes hotels, restaurants, and all the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11384)|
| 3:09:48| And there's also major road improvements as well as major infrastructure with electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11388)|

| 3:10:02| So what we're trying to do is to bring the zonings into a situation where it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11402)|
| 3:10:09| more consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11409)|

| 3:10:37| We don't want hotels in Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11437)|

| 3:15:12| Or are you going to do a single house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11712)|
| 3:15:15| What are your plans there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| Plans essentially for a single home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11717)|
| 3:15:20| Looking for, essentially, if we just do a single home right now with the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11720)|
| 3:15:25| of putting an in-home business in the home, it's not allowed with the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11725)|
| 3:15:32| With the change to zoning, if we want to put an in-home business in the single home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11732)|
| 3:15:37| it's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11737)|
| 3:15:40| So we have to go to LDR to have an in-home business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11740)|
| 3:15:45| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11745)|
| 3:15:49| That, I'd have to do, I'd have to look a little bit further into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11749)|
| 3:15:53| I'd have to look at the code specifically to see what other zones would allow an in-home business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11753)|
| 3:15:58| When I was reading this, I thought, just like you said, you want to build your single home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11758)|
| 3:16:02| or whatever, and then now you're asking for LDR, which is fine, which is an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11762)|
| 3:16:08| of the South Oaks, I think, subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11768)|
| 3:16:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11770)|
| 3:16:11| Which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11771)|
| 3:16:11| I mean, I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11771)|
| 3:16:14| And the neighbors that called didn't have a problem with it, as long as they knew that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11774)|
| 3:16:18| at one time it will be an extension of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11778)|
| 3:16:21| But they would be happy to know that there's only going to be one house there, too, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11781)|
| 3:16:25| That's, so, you know, if Amy's good with it, I'm good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11785)|
| 3:16:29| I mean, I just, you know, why are you going LDR when you may not have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11789)|
| 3:16:35| From the assistance I've gotten from people who have helped me with this in the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=11795)|

| 3:50:28| But then on the other side, we have other experts who have just as good of credentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13828)|
| 3:50:33| and just an impeccable reputation who say, no, the masks don't help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13833)|
| 3:50:37| And in fact, because of the fact that you are wearing a mask and re-inhaling pathogens that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13837)|
| 3:50:43| your body is trying to get rid of, and also you're inhaling a higher concentration level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13843)|
| 3:50:48| of carbon dioxide because it doesn't escape the mask, you may actually be compromising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13848)|
| 3:50:53| your immune system and making matters worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13853)|
| 3:50:56| And one of the great fears is that some of them have expressed that this is really going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13856)|
| 3:51:00| around to roost when we get into flu season, because many of us have been compromising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13860)|
| 3:51:04| our immune systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13864)|
| 3:51:06| Okay, now we can have an opinion about that, but the fact of the matter is once we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13866)|
| 3:51:09| at that, we know one thing, the science is not settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13869)|
| 3:51:14| So how can you say it's responsible for a board of health to issue a mandate when clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13874)|
| 3:51:20| the science is not settled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13880)|
| 3:51:22| It's not responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13882)|
| 3:51:24| Now I want to talk about the mandate itself because it's, I was, I wanted to use a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13884)|
| 3:51:29| word, but I'm just going to have to say it's kind of bizarre because if you really look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13889)|
| 3:51:33| at it, there are so many exclusions and exceptions that you wonder, does anybody actually have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13893)|
| 3:51:39| to wear a mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13899)|
| 3:51:41| Because I guarantee you that you can find some exception or exclusion that applies to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13901)|
| 3:51:46| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13906)|
| 3:51:47| So nobody's actually breaking the rules if they're not wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13907)|
| 3:51:50| But then even so ask yourself this question, if COVID-19 is really serious, is that serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13910)|
| 3:51:56| as we've been told?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13916)|
| 3:51:57| And I'm not going to say it's not serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13917)|
| 3:52:00| I, as far as I can tell, it's a little worse than the flu, at least that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13920)|
| 3:52:04| But if it's really that deadly and masks really were that effective, why are there any exclusions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13924)|
| 3:52:12| But let's go beyond that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| What kind of a mask do you need to wear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13934)|
| 3:52:17| I could have taken an old pair of my fruit of the looms, that's all threadbare, tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13937)|
| 3:52:21| it around my face tonight, and that is an acceptable mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13941)|
| 3:52:26| But does anybody really think a pair of old fruit of the looms is as effective as an N95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13946)|
| 3:52:32| mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13952)|
| 3:52:32| Does anybody really believe that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13952)|
| 3:52:34| Of course it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13954)|
| 3:52:36| And yet that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13956)|
| 3:52:37| So we've got a board that has basically issued a mandate with unsettled science and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13957)|
| 3:52:42| say, put whatever on your face you want, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13962)|
| 3:52:46| It makes me wonder, first of all, they're being irresponsible, but are they even taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13966)|
| 3:52:50| themselves seriously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13970)|
| 3:52:51| So back to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13971)|
| 3:52:53| The question is not about mask mandates, curfews, it is about jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13973)|
| 3:52:58| Should the Board of Health have jurisdiction or should an elected body of officials, such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13978)|
| 3:53:03| as the County Commission, have jurisdiction to determine whether we have masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13983)|
| 3:53:07| And keep in mind, if the Board of Health was gone tomorrow, there would be nothing to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13987)|
| 3:53:11| this body from adopting a resolution and enforcing mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13991)|
| 3:53:16| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13996)|
| 3:53:17| Now, the other question about this, this is where it gets tricky, because the TCA is who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=13997)|
| 3:53:21| actually gave the authority to the health board, which brings in question, does this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14001)|
| 3:53:27| resolution actually have any teeth in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14007)|
| 3:53:31| Probably going to be kind of hard to prove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| But so then the question is, should we even pass it at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14013)|
| 3:53:37| Well, I tell you, I think you should pass it, because passing this resolution is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14017)|
| 3:53:42| Because passing this resolution is going to send a strong voice to Nashville, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14022)|
| 3:53:48| just as it is important for us citizens to make our voices heard, it is important for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14028)|
| 3:53:53| our elected bodies to make their voices heard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14033)|
| 3:53:57| So I would encourage you and urge you as you pass, I guess you're going to vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14037)|
| 3:54:00| later this evening, to really consider that and consider the importance of actually making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14040)|
| 3:54:05| your voice heard in the higher forms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14045)|
| 3:54:08| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14048)|
| 3:54:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14049)|
| 3:54:20| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14060)|
| 3:54:22| My name is Kim Sprague, and my zip code is 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14062)|
| 3:54:26| I'd rather not give my full address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14066)|
| 3:54:30| I watched the Board of Health meeting this past week, and one of the members said something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14070)|
| 3:54:36| that that kind of struck me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14076)|
| 3:54:38| She said, why does it matter that we weren't elected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14078)|
| 3:54:43| And I realized then that, and I've heard it again tonight, that a lot of the health professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14083)|
| 3:54:49| whether they're on that board, or they work for that board, or they're just health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14089)|
| 3:54:54| in general, are taking it personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14094)|
| 3:54:56| They're taking this as an affront to their profession, to their views, to their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14096)|
| 3:55:03| Now, the experts fall on both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14103)|
| 3:55:06| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14106)|
| 3:55:06| But even if they didn't, even if this health board was telling us something that was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14106)|
| 3:55:12| clear science and obvious to everyone, I'd like to say that it's not personal, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14112)|
| 3:55:18| not about the health or the science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14118)|
| 3:55:21| I would be standing before you today if we were discussing a zoning board, or a utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14121)|
| 3:55:26| board, or any other sort of board that was legislating as appointed people with no checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14126)|
| 3:55:33| and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14133)|
| 3:55:35| This is about the democratic process, the board having powers to legislate without checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14135)|
| 3:55:44| and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14144)|
| 3:55:45| It's not about the credentials of the health board or their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14145)|
| 3:55:50| And then I saw something else this week that sort of further drove home that this isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14150)|
| 3:55:56| really clear to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14156)|
| 3:55:57| Somebody posted on Facebook a graphic of the Supreme Court and said, people are saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14157)|
| 3:56:05| that this is an unelected board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14165)|
| 3:56:08| They're appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14168)|
| 3:56:09| Well, so is the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14169)|
| 3:56:12| The shocking thing about that meme that just struck me as, to be honest, very ignorant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14172)|
| 3:56:17| was it was posted by a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14177)|
| 3:56:20| And I thought, does the commission not understand the role of government and the role of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14180)|
| 3:56:26| role of government and the branches of government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14186)|
| 3:56:30| The Supreme Court was appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14190)|
| 3:56:32| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14192)|
| 3:56:33| But they don't make law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14193)|
| 3:56:35| They check law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14195)|
| 3:56:36| It's part of a checks and balances thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14196)|
| 3:56:40| So I thought I would maybe explain, because I think there's a lot of people watching and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14200)|
| 3:56:44| listening that are taking this as a personal affront to the health care system, or to masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14204)|
| 3:56:51| specifically, and not understanding that the argument has to do with our governmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14211)|
| 3:56:56| process, our democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14216)|
| 3:56:59| There are three branches of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14219)|
| 3:57:02| I have the Schoolhouse Rock videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14222)|
| 3:57:03| I happen to like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14223)|
| 3:57:05| My kids happen to like them, even though they're old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14225)|
| 3:57:08| And they spell out very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14228)|
| 3:57:10| You have the executive power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14230)|
| 3:57:13| You have the judicial branch and the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14233)|
| 3:57:17| So the legislative branch really encompasses people at every level, commissioners such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14237)|
| 3:57:23| as yourselves, people in Nashville, people in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14243)|
| 3:57:28| We elect people to represent us all across the country at every level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14248)|
| 3:57:33| And I think many of us agree that government close to the people is the best government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14253)|
| 3:57:38| But people vote, and the legislative branch gets to make the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14258)|
| 3:57:44| Elected people, they can be taken in or out of office because the people put them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14264)|
| 3:57:48| and they're supposed to represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14268)|
| 3:57:52| The judicial branch, which doesn't get to make any laws, checks those laws against the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14272)|
| 3:57:59| Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14279)|
| 3:58:00| They measure them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14280)|
| 3:58:01| They make sure that no rights are being violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14281)|
| 3:58:04| It's a system of checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14284)|
| 3:58:07| But here we have a Board of Health that is making law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14287)|
| 3:58:13| Obviously, they're unelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14293)|
| 3:58:16| And then they're making law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14296)|
| 3:58:18| And there's no checks or balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14298)|
| 3:58:21| That is the problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14301)|
| 3:58:22| It's not the science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14302)|
| 3:58:23| It's not whether or not we should or shouldn't wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14303)|
| 3:58:27| It's the lack of checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14307)|
| 3:58:29| It's the lack of representation to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14309)|
| 3:58:32| And they should not have legislative powers, which is essentially what you all have given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14312)|
| 3:58:38| them, even if their science was accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14318)|
| 3:58:41| If their science was accurate, and this was something like super crystal clear that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14321)|
| 3:58:45| really needed to do because of a pandemic, you all could put that in place, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14325)|
| 3:58:50| I'm not quite exactly sure how Tennessee government works, but I think there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14330)|
| 3:58:55| legislative bodies that could then put that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14335)|
| 3:58:58| And you guys aren't medical experts, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14338)|
| 3:59:01| But you deal with a lot of subjects where you're not experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14341)|
| 3:59:04| And you call in experts and consult with experts and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14344)|
| 3:59:08| And you could do that in the case of a health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14348)|
| 3:59:11| But you do not need a health board to be legislating with no checks and balances at all in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14351)|
| 3:59:20| And that's what makes this different than, for example, the Supreme Court Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14360)|
| 3:59:25| So I hope that that's clear to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14365)|
| 3:59:27| And I would ask you to please dissolve this board, take away its powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14367)|
| 3:59:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14372)|

| 4:00:02| I'd like to first speak, all of this is going to be very personal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14402)|
| 4:00:05| I'd like to first speak to my respect for the Public Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14405)|
| 4:00:09| It was in 2009 when I was charged with the responsibility of putting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14409)|
| 4:00:14| continuity of operations plan for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14414)|
| 4:00:19| regional office here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14419)|
| 4:00:21| In so doing, I saw that the Department of Health was providing that sort of assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14421)|
| 4:00:26| to local businesses, local churches on how to plan in a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14426)|
| 4:00:32| It's easy to do that if there's, frankly, if it's a disaster that's caused by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14432)|
| 4:00:38| floods or explosions or even outrage in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14438)|
| 4:00:47| What is the most wicked of these is a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14447)|
| 4:00:50| At that time, as a former director of the Volunteer Ministry Center, I realized that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14450)|
| 4:00:56| the homeless shelters in town were the ones who were going to be the least equipped to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14456)|
| 4:01:01| respond to a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14461)|
| 4:01:04| They're dealing with clients who are very vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14464)|
| 4:01:08| It's almost impossible to do social distancing for their meals or even the sleeping in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14468)|
| 4:01:14| current practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14474)|
| 4:01:16| And if their staff is getting sick and staying home or caring for someone at home, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14476)|
| 4:01:21| they're going to be understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14481)|
| 4:01:23| Their volunteers are going to stay at home because they're going to have fears of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14483)|
| 4:01:27| That's when I went to the Public Health Department, met with Dr. Buchanan, and later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14487)|
| 4:01:32| on with Larry Hutzel with First Staff, and they developed a plan for the homeless service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14492)|
| 4:01:38| providers to how to plan for a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14498)|
| 4:01:42| This was in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14502)|
| 4:01:45| They had the foresight to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14505)|
| 4:01:48| So when this pandemic came up in March, the shelters and the other homeless service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14508)|
| 4:01:53| providers already had a plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14513)|
| 4:01:54| It already thought through, how are we going to respond to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14514)|
| 4:01:58| Now, a reason this is personal to me, not just the fact that I'm a geezer, 73 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14518)|

| 4:02:37| I recently went to Costco to get glasses adjusted right before visiting her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14557)|
| 4:02:42| Thought it would be easy enough because I'd been there before and it looked like they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14562)|
| 4:02:46| were doing things safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14566)|
| 4:02:48| On my way out, it wasn't until on my way out that I noticed that there were people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14568)|
| 4:02:54| shopping there who weren't wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14574)|
| 4:02:57| I looked at Costco's policies, and their policies are that if someone comes to shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14577)|
| 4:03:03| there, they don't have a mask, they turn them away, but they do reasonable accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14583)|
| 4:03:09| You can shop online, make your purchase, drive up, we will deliver it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14589)|
| 4:03:17| Before I came tonight, I checked to see what the situation was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14597)|
| 4:03:23| I did not want to be threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| I am disappointed that the reasonable accommodations that the public building authority made for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14605)|
| 4:03:35| people who feel that either that their freedom is being infringed upon by not wearing a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14615)|
| 4:03:42| or that they have a health problem, they can't wear a mask, that they were allowed to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14622)|
| 4:03:47| downstairs, when it had been set up for them to be able to speak from upstairs, they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14627)|
| 4:03:53| allowed to come downstairs and speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14633)|
| 4:03:57| I should have thought more about sitting here on the front, but I wasn't expecting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14637)|

| 4:04:12| We've heard earlier, let me just end it at that, before I get bitter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14652)|
| 4:04:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14658)|
| 4:04:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14658)|
| 4:04:20| Alexis Tudor, please make yourself known, Alexis Tudor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14660)|
| 4:04:27| Are you Alexis Tudor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14667)|
| 4:04:28| I am Alexis Tudor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14668)|

| 4:04:30| If I call your name, if you guys would like, just give me a, yeah, that's me, because I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14670)|

| 4:04:37| If you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14677)|
| 4:04:45| Yeah, Alexis Tudor, 1411 Carpenter Road, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14685)|
| 4:04:53| Okay, so first of all, just to put things into perspective, because ever since March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14693)|
| 4:04:59| started, I've been beside myself trying to understand how this pandemic works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14699)|
| 4:05:04| So in Knox County, so far in the last six months, this many people have died represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14704)|
| 4:05:11| by these graves, 40 graves, about 4,000 people, last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14711)|
| 4:05:15| And this is how many have died of COVID, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14715)|
| 4:05:20| This little thing here has created a state of emergency, an emergency that's gone on for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14720)|
| 4:05:27| six months, an amazing emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14727)|
| 4:05:30| Usually emergencies go on for, you know, a couple hours, maybe a day, a week, months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14730)|
| 4:05:37| So, you know, I guess what I'm asking is for people to step back a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14737)|
| 4:05:44| Right now in Knox County, so far, four out of 10,000 people have died in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14744)|
| 4:05:51| of COVID, and regularly 90 out of 10,000 people have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14751)|
| 4:05:56| So think of that, four and 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14756)|
| 4:06:02| Now, people say, again, hey, if we didn't do this, we would have had massive death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14762)|
| 4:06:09| I suggest you look at Sweden's rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14769)|
| 4:06:12| Sweden has stopped having people die, and it's been going on for quite a while, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14772)|
| 4:06:18| months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14778)|
| 4:06:20| Effectively, no one is dying in that country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14780)|
| 4:06:22| They have accomplished herd immunity, despite what people want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14782)|
| 4:06:27| And excuse my language, but numbers talk and bullshit walks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14787)|
| 4:06:33| I feel this is a result of something I call COVID myopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14793)|
| 4:06:37| And the destruction that has happened due to this COVID myopia is what I call the reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14797)|
| 4:06:43| demic, because this, to me, doesn't seem like a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14803)|
| 4:06:47| You know, usually when I hear pandemic, I think like two or three times the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14807)|
| 4:06:51| people are dying usually, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14811)|
| 4:06:52| So I would think like it would be three times this bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14812)|
| 4:06:55| But it's just this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14815)|
| 4:06:58| Doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14818)|
| 4:07:00| So now, based on that, we're giving the health board all these authorities, based on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14820)|
| 4:07:06| little, little grape here, relatively speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14826)|
| 4:07:10| And it just, you know, I'm asking people to look at this with a bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14830)|
| 4:07:16| Now, every decision you make has a cost and a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14836)|

| 4:07:43| So what is the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14863)|
| 4:07:45| Suicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14865)|

| 4:08:59| We expected this rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=14939)|

| 4:14:46| they have every reason to continue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15286)|
| 4:14:51| We actually have a gentleman who sits and advises them legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15291)|
| 4:14:56| and his response is, let them sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15296)|
| 4:15:01| That should offend everybody in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15301)|
| 4:15:04| Because at the end of the day, we sue and we win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15304)|
| 4:15:09| We still pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15309)|
| 4:15:12| Your job, you come out here and you make decisions on what to spend our money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15312)|
| 4:15:18| Bridges, roads, hospitals, sewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15318)|
| 4:15:21| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15321)|
| 4:15:22| You have a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15322)|
| 4:15:25| But when these lawsuits start to take effect and we start to win, and we will win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15325)|
| 4:15:31| we still have to pay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15331)|
| 4:15:34| And we shouldn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15334)|
| 4:15:36| Simple aspect, take the responsibility and take the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15336)|
| 4:15:41| You may not like what I'm suggesting, but I'm not here to make friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15341)|
| 4:15:44| I'm here to point my point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15344)|
| 4:15:47| Take the responsibility and the authority away from that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15347)|
| 4:15:52| put it back on yourself, and make the decision to dissolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15352)|
| 4:15:57| I wish they were experts in their field, because we would have immunologists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15357)|
| 4:16:00| we'd have virologists, we'd have epidemiologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15360)|
| 4:16:03| They would be on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15363)|
| 4:16:04| If they spoke, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15364)|
| 4:16:07| I'll leave with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15367)|
| 4:16:08| My biggest fear on this mass situation, realistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15368)|
| 4:16:12| is in six months and a year, when we have a big, bad, nasty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15372)|
| 4:16:16| ugly butt, a level four virulent that a mass would have stopped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15376)|
| 4:16:22| people will die because they will say, oh, this is like the CV-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15382)|
| 4:16:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15390)|
| 4:16:30| With that, I will let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15390)|
| 4:16:31| I apologize if I seemed a little bit overzealous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15391)|
| 4:16:35| but I have been sitting up there and I was falling asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15395)|
| 4:16:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15397)|
| 4:16:38| Angie Goffert, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15398)|
| 4:16:53| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15413)|
| 4:16:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15415)|
| 4:16:55| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15415)|
| 4:16:56| My name is Angie Goffert, and I live on Delray Road in Gulf Park Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15416)|
| 4:17:00| 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15420)|
| 4:17:02| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15422)|
| 4:17:04| I am a daughter, wife, and a mom, and I take those roles seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15424)|
| 4:17:09| The mom role has become so very important this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15429)|
| 4:17:12| I have always been able to answer our kids' questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15432)|
| 4:17:15| whether I had to tell them that I'll look into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15435)|
| 4:17:18| and get back to them or give them an answer immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15438)|
| 4:17:23| I so wish that that was still the case, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15443)|
| 4:17:28| I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15448)|
| 4:17:29| It's a wonderful place to live and raise a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15449)|
| 4:17:32| but many of the things that I loved have changed drastically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15452)|
| 4:17:36| and I find myself with more questions than answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15456)|
| 4:17:40| When the schools closed for spring break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15460)|
| 4:17:42| we were hopeful that our class of 2020 graduate and our younger daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15462)|
| 4:17:46| would return to school and see their teachers and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15466)|
| 4:17:50| That was not to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15470)|
| 4:17:52| Plans for graduation were shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15472)|
| 4:17:54| We found out we would not be able to be there in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15474)|
| 4:17:58| So, for the first time in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15478)|
| 4:18:01| I started calling government officials and asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15481)|
| 4:18:06| I kept pushing, along with many other moms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15486)|
| 4:18:09| and you know how we moms are, so just let that go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15489)|
| 4:18:12| And we were finally allowed to watch our son receive his diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15492)|
| 4:18:16| The hug after that was glorious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15496)|
| 4:18:20| Since our parents are older, we only had four tickets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15500)|
| 4:18:23| so we had our son in his cap and gown and took him to see his grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15503)|
| 4:18:28| We had stayed away because we were told that that would keep them safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15508)|
| 4:18:34| His grandmother walked toward him and hugged him and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15514)|
| 4:18:40| I'm 80, I'm going to die of something anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15520)|
| 4:18:43| so I'm going to hug, I'm going to die hugging my grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15523)|
| 4:18:48| That statement from my mom changed everything for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15528)|
| 4:18:52| and I have to ask more questions for her and for my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15532)|
| 4:18:56| Midsummer, things were looking really good for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15536)|
| 4:19:00| Even though the virus was not rampant in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15540)|
| 4:19:03| more restrictions and mandates were enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15543)|
| 4:19:06| It seemed the cases started to really rise at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15546)|
| 4:19:10| Again, my role as mom was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15550)|
| 4:19:13| Both of our kids had so many questions and I had so very few answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15553)|
| 4:19:18| Will school reopen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15558)|
| 4:19:19| Why are we taking all these measures for a virus that has a 99% recovery rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15559)|
| 4:19:24| Why can't we see our friends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15564)|
| 4:19:26| Why can't we go to church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15566)|
| 4:19:28| Unfortunately, there were few answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15568)|
| 4:19:31| I called the health department and the Tennessee Department of Health, no answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15571)|
| 4:19:36| So I continued to read and analyze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15576)|
| 4:19:39| No, I'm not a doctor, but I'm a good researcher and more than willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15579)|
| 4:19:44| In this, there is only one side speaking and the others are being silenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15584)|
| 4:19:48| even when they may offer real hope and real answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15588)|
| 4:19:52| We are constantly told how many cases there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15592)|
| 4:19:55| Should that really be a metric for our decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15595)|
| 4:19:58| We are now told almost weekly that our hospital system is on yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15598)|
| 4:20:03| According to the KCHD website, the total number is around 150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15603)|
| 4:20:08| with around 40 right now from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15608)|
| 4:20:11| If 150 patients put our hospital system on yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15611)|
| 4:20:16| don't we have an infrastructure problem, not a virus problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15616)|
| 4:20:20| Now they say that there may be more testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15620)|
| 4:20:23| What if the cases are going down because the virus is not as severe as it was in the beginning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15623)|
| 4:20:28| In essence, we know better, we do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15628)|
| 4:20:32| On the subject of testing, why are we still using a test that is so sensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15632)|
| 4:20:36| that it catches all parts of the virus, not just contagious people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15636)|
| 4:20:41| Many epidemiologists and virologists have called out the testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15641)|
| 4:20:44| and said we have to run the test at a much lower cycle threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15644)|
| 4:20:48| to find those that are truly sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15648)|
| 4:20:50| That's a number that nobody's willing to give away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15650)|
| 4:20:53| Why is overall health not the focus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15653)|
| 4:20:56| Our family is aware of many teenagers that have been on suicide watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15656)|
| 4:20:59| one of which attempted to take her life and spent time getting help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15659)|
| 4:21:03| for her depression that was so stark that she didn't want to be here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15663)|
| 4:21:07| Where does that fit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15667)|
| 4:21:09| Where is the priority on what we are doing to our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15669)|
| 4:21:12| We are not allowing Knox County residents to determine their own risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15672)|
| 4:21:16| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15676)|
| 4:21:18| I do believe there's a virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15678)|
| 4:21:19| I know that people have become sick and sadly we have lost members of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15679)|
| 4:21:24| Our failure to protect the elderly and vulnerable on top of the collateral damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15684)|
| 4:21:28| inflicted by restrictions and mandates is beyond tragic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15688)|
| 4:21:32| We should have done better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15692)|
| 4:21:34| We have a chance to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15694)|
| 4:21:36| Please dissolve the Board of Health and prove to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15696)|
| 4:21:38| that you trust the Knox County citizens to choose responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15698)|
| 4:21:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15702)|

| 4:21:55| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15715)|
| 4:22:03| My name is Sarah Morris and I'm not currently a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15723)|
| 4:22:06| Although the majority of my adult life, I have lived and worked in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15726)|
| 4:22:10| and most of my personal business is conducted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15730)|
| 4:22:13| Back in March, I was asked by a former co-worker while we were having a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15733)|
| 4:22:17| about the shutdown and quarantine of which I was vehemently opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15737)|
| 4:22:21| He asked me what number of lives lost would change my mind about my stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15741)|

| 4:22:26| This isn't to say that I don't value life and I am deeply sorry for anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15746)|

| 4:22:32| But I want to explain the reason why I gave the answer that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15752)|
| 4:22:35| One word, precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15755)|
| 4:22:37| There has only been one time in history where a government regime rose to power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15757)|
| 4:22:41| and then gave it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15761)|
| 4:22:42| That was right after our founding fathers had just finished liberating a country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15762)|
| 4:22:46| from a tyrannical king.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15766)|
| 4:22:48| They knew firsthand what tyranny was, what it looked like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15768)|
| 4:22:51| and how people suffered under the weight of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15771)|
| 4:22:53| They decided against insurmountable odds that they were no longer willing to live under tyranny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15773)|
| 4:22:58| and they were prepared to give everything, even their lives, to end that tyranny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15778)|
| 4:23:02| Many of them did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15782)|
| 4:23:03| What they did next was inconceivable in the fact that it had never been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15783)|
| 4:23:07| They saw that the first thing that every regime that had risen to power did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15787)|
| 4:23:12| was create a list of rules and laws that people had to follow under that ruler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15792)|
| 4:23:16| So the first thing they did was create a list of rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15796)|
| 4:23:20| unalienable, which meant could not be taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15800)|
| 4:23:24| A list of things that everyone had the right to do above all else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15804)|
| 4:23:28| because they weren't given by men but by their creator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15808)|
| 4:23:31| They gave the power back to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15811)|
| 4:23:33| The next thing they did was spend a hundred days writing the single greatest piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15813)|
| 4:23:37| legislation in history to make sure that those rights would never again be infringed upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15817)|
| 4:23:42| or taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15822)|
| 4:23:43| Since March, the Board of Health has continuously attacked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15823)|
| 4:23:46| ignored, and flat-out taken those rights from the citizens and business owners of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15826)|
| 4:23:51| This is the reason why I answered my former co-worker was saying that there will be no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15831)|
| 4:23:54| amount of lives lost that will justify the suspension or removing our rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15834)|
| 4:23:59| Because once that precedent is set, it is set for not only everyone living in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15839)|
| 4:24:03| in Knox County today, but also for every generation to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15843)|
| 4:24:07| We have an opportunity now for you to dissolve the Board of Health and give the rights back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15847)|
| 4:24:11| to the people the way our founding fathers intended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15851)|
| 4:24:14| In addition to that, modern medicine has made astonishing advances in the last hundred years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15854)|
| 4:24:18| One of the things that came from that was informed consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15858)|
| 4:24:21| A doctor is required to make their patient as informed about an illness and possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15861)|
| 4:24:25| treatment options as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15865)|
| 4:24:27| But then the decision on treatment legally is left to the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15867)|
| 4:24:31| As members of the health care community, the Board of Health should be held to the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15871)|
| 4:24:34| standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15874)|
| 4:24:35| If anything, they should present the facts, possible ways to help keep people from getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15875)|
| 4:24:40| sick, but ultimately it should be left up to each individual to determine their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15880)|
| 4:24:44| self-care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15884)|
| 4:24:44| I have no problem if people want to choose to wear a mask, so long as it remains a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15884)|
| 4:24:49| I draw the line at unelected people trying to force others that they have no constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15889)|
| 4:24:54| power over to adhere to a certain set of medical treatment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15894)|
| 4:24:57| A mask is a medical device, therefore it is up to each person to choose to wear it or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15897)|
| 4:25:01| not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15901)|
| 4:25:02| If they have information saying that gathering in large groups increases the chance of infection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15902)|
| 4:25:06| they should put those numbers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15906)|
| 4:25:08| But then it should be left to each person to choose whether they want to gather or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15908)|
| 4:25:12| After all, the right to assembly was one of the very first things our founding fathers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15912)|
| 4:25:16| knew people had the right to do above all else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15916)|
| 4:25:19| This should include businesses and restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15919)|
| 4:25:21| Businesses should have the option to make their own rules inside their establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15921)|
| 4:25:24| and if people don't agree with it, they can simply choose to frequent somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15924)|
| 4:25:28| U.S. elected officials took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15928)|
| 4:25:32| the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15932)|

| 4:25:37| To date, you haven't done that, but you have the chance to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15937)|
| 4:25:41| I call for the complete dissolution of the current Board of Health, and if your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15941)|
| 4:25:45| agree and see fit for you to appoint a new board, I call that before that happens, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15945)|
| 4:25:49| place strict rules on what that board can and cannot do when it comes to any health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15949)|

| 4:25:59| Laws are voted in by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15959)|
| 4:26:00| A mandate is not a law, and therefore should not hold any consequences for people who go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15960)|
| 4:26:04| against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15964)|
| 4:26:05| Ronald Reagan said, freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15965)|

| 4:26:38| A lot of people have said a lot of things, and a lot of people came prepared, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=15998)|
| 4:26:42| tell you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16002)|
| 4:26:43| I have never been proud of government officials, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16003)|
| 4:26:49| They said, trust the government, and what did they do to the Native Americans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16009)|
| 4:26:53| They put them in reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16013)|
| 4:26:55| They said, trust the government, what did they do to the Jews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16015)|
| 4:26:58| They put them in cattle cars, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16018)|
| 4:27:01| This is probably the first opportunity that proved me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16021)|

| 4:27:14| Now, the reason why is this, very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16034)|
| 4:27:17| You guys have probably never lived abroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16037)|
| 4:27:20| You guys don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16040)|

| 4:27:39| Well, if you served overseas, you knew what it was to live in one of those countries that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=16059)|
